            "Question 9": "As a student eager to join the organization, I believe all pillars play critical roles in the mission statement. The development division, I think, is the heart of the pillars and holds paramount importance. In the transitioning phase of our lives, while we are molding our future, the direct focus on professional advancement that the development division offers is priceless. The Career Fair and Corporate Relations committees provide innumerable ways to network, learn, and secure jobs. The Engineering Development, Finance, and ProTrip committees further enrich our skills and ensure that we are both academically well and ready to tackle our industry of choice. While the other divisions contribute significantly to the holistic growth of the organization, the Development division influences our immediate futures and prepares us for the world outside. Being a part of this division would enhance my growth and allow me to contribute effectively to my peers.",
            "Question 10": "Before I entered college, I had long admired my brother for how hard he worked and how well he was thriving on the premed track. Wanting to emulate his success, I chose premed, thinking it was also my calling since we shared many interests as we grew up. However, I felt detached, while he could seize such complex biological processes and showed a passion for patient care. It dawned on me that I was echoing his path without genuinely connecting with the heart of medicine. This realization was a tremendous turning point. I understood that embracing a profession from stem must be a personal passion, not an imitation. I began exploring other disciplines, pursuing mentorship, and attending diverse workshops. While my respect for my brother still burned bright, I learned the importance of uncovering my passion. This journey taught me the value of introspection and crafting my life path.",
            "Question 11": "As a shift manager at KFC, I noticed our evening shifts were consistently facing longer customer wait times, leading to complaints and dissatisfaction. Upon analysis, I identified a pattern: the preparation for the dinner rush began too close to peak hours, which caused a backlog. Seeing an avenue for improvement, I proposed changing our preparation schedule. I initiated an earlier start to food preparation and organized a team briefing for the evening rush. This ensured that everyone knew their roles and what to do during these busy periods. I introduced a feedback system for the team to share real-time challenges they experienced during peak times. Results were immediate. The wait times were reduced, customer complaints were far fewer, and the staff felt more confident. By pinpointing a gap in our operations and implementing a proactive approach, I improved my team's customer experience and environment."

            "Question 9": "I have always been interested in a career that connects my passion for medicine and creativity but was unsure about what specifically. When I discovered biomedical engineering, I fell in love with the idea of using math and physics to save lives. SEC\u2019s pillar of engineering awareness means the most to me because I want others to realize how vital engineering is to all aspects of our society. I got the opportunity to show younger students just how revolutionary engineering is through programs like VAST and SWE Outreach. I found these experiences truly rewarding because I played a significant role in inspiring future professionals to think differently. I would like to continue my efforts in exposing others to the many opportunities in engineering by directly contributing to the Envision Conference and the external division of SEC as a whole.",
            "Question 10": "Last year, I was placed in a research team to conduct customer discovery interviews for a niche medical device. We did not have any personal connections in the field so we were at a lack of potential interviewees. Additionally, my teammates were master's students who had an intense academic workload and less time to spare. I recognized this and took the lead by contacting over 800 experts and writing detailed scripts that my teammates could follow. Soon enough, we successfully completed 40 interviews, earning 5000$ towards our research. Through this experience, I realized how valuable leadership is to my personal and professional growth. I learned how to be proactive and the importance of being a team player. I intend to continue challenging myself to strengthen my collaborative and leadership skills in any way possible to ultimately drive a positive change within my community at Texas A&M and beyond.",
            "Question 11": "Last year, I joined a women\u2019s organization to step out of my comfort zone and form strong relationships with other women. As a new member, I was exposed to many different personalities and grew a lot as a woman. However, I noticed the lack of diversity in the organization and decided to be a part of the change in that matter. When recruitment came around, I made it my intention to connect with more women of color and women who would not traditionally apply to such organizations. I shared my experiences with them and explained the ways I benefited from being in the organization. I did my best to make them feel more comfortable during the recruitment process without giving them any unfair advantages. Consequently, I played a leading role in the organization receiving the highest number of applications and the most diverse pool in its history."

            "Question 9": "The first pillar from the SEC Mission Statement resonates the most with me\u2014to strive to be the representative voice of all engineering students. During my time in the Zachry Leadership Program, I have explored various facets of leadership and business enterprise via team projects and retreats. As a result of the program, I have fine-tuned my authentic leadership style and have honed in on my five core values\u2014integrity, perseverance, humility, wisdom, and creativity. These values best align with my interests, experiences, and purpose. I formulated this purpose during the most recent retreat in August: \u201cTo advocate for those who feel lost, hurt, or alone, so that they instead feel loved and assured of their inherent value and importance in this world\u201d. I strive to make others feel heard, including my engineering peers. I was struck by how closely the first SEC pillar aligns with my values and purpose.",
            "Question 10": "The summer after my freshman year, I worked on campus as an undergraduate researcher in the chemical engineering department. For my project, I was required to deliver weekly PowerPoint updates for my two Professors and monthly for my Los Alamos National Labs mentor. Until this point, I had never learned how to construct an effective technical presentation. Thus, the constructive feedback I received after my first attempt was very pointed. After this, I realized that my technical communication capabilities desperately required attention; such a skill is critical to academic and professional success. I strove the entire summer to build up these skillsets by seeking advice from my PhD mentors, reading past lab papers, attending conferences, and practicing persistently. By the end of the summer, my communication talents had greatly improved. I was even awarded the A&M Outstanding Final Presentation award for the REU program.",
            "Question 11": "I attended a rigorous high school where most students were stressed, exhausted, and low in morale. We had a disciplinary points system similar to in Harry Potter, but when I was elected as the Head of Honor Council my senior year, I realized that this system needed improvement. The council had previously been despised for seeming intolerant and as the grim reaper of detention slips. After working with my team members, I proposed the solution which would encourage good behavior, change the outlook of the student body towards the council, and boost overall morale: the top three students earning the highest point totals at the end of each week would receive a smiley face note and a popsicle. This improvement made a noticeable impact! If elected to SEC, I could help institute some sort of reward system for members or even for kids who participate in conferences such as EnVision."

The beauty of engineering is that it can be done by anyone, in any field. I feel that this message is so important to communicate, especially to prospective engineering students. I hope to share my love of engineering with kids of all ages, and show them that they can be engineers, regardless of their background. I\u2019ve explored this passion through past work experience and various volunteer opportunities, from international robotics camps to local elementary school coding clubs. The ability to watch young students discover their interest in engineering, especially when they don\u2019t always get to explore STEM topics, is unmatched. Programs like Envision and Engineers Week prove that SEC is committed to promoting engineering awareness to all ages, and I aspire to contribute to this goal.",
            "Question 10": "In 2020, I joined a company focused on coding education for K-8th grade students. Initially I strictly taught Scratch, a basic programming platform. However, when we transitioned to online teaching due to COVID, my boss presented an opportunity for me to teach other classes in Python, JavaScript and Java - languages I'd barely worked with. The promise of getting to further impact the kids, and work with older students who were considering STEM careers, motivated me to independently teach myself. I studied online tutorials and went through the company curriculum to ensure I had mastered the basics. I completed the student projects so that I could account for any errors they may run into. After that summer, I was able to comfortably teach a variety of classes for the next two years. Additionally, I had gained the valuable skill of quick and adaptive learning that I still find invaluable today.",
            "Question 11": "At my recent internship I was tasked with finding a better material for a 3-D printed scaffold. As I began my work studying different materials, through literature review and discussions with other lab members, I noticed some issues with the current 3-D bioprinting method. The previous method was inconsistent and not very reliable. Through independent research I discovered another, more efficient and repeatable method and found a way to apply it to our purposes. By the time I left the lab, I had not only achieved the goal of discovering a more suitable material, but had also improved the method followed. Both my proposed material and method were successful, and have replaced the previous practices. Using my skill set to improve the process for future work in the lab was incredibly rewarding, and I am always looking for ways to exercise this innovation."

            "Question 10": "In both my junior and senior years of high school, I served as Front Ensemble Captain for my high school\u2019s band. I, however, wasn\u2019t a very good percussionist. While I had played classical piano growing up, I was put in the percussion program as a rookie, surrounded by kids who\u2019d been playing drums since age 10, and, for the first time in my life, I felt extremely unqualified. Over the next few years, with after-school lessons and hours on the marimba, I began to shorten the curve. By junior year, I was chosen to lead the ensemble despite this same curve. In this position, I was able to hone my leadership skills and develop my passion for education. In terms of my approach to learning in situations of adversity\u2013 whether in music or life\u2013 I look to my parents, whose actions exemplify the fruitfulness of hard work.",
            "Question 11": "As someone who struggles with mental illness on a daily basis, establishing an avenue through which those with similar struggles and academic pressures could benefit has always been apparent and important to me. In high school, I was the president of my school\u2019s National Honor Society chapter during my senior year. With the help of fellow NHS officers as well as school staff and administration, I was able to establish a student-led peer mentor program and mental health initiative to serve every student on our campus. These gatherings took place every Thursday after school in our campus\u2019s library, with attendance ranging anywhere between 1 and 50 students. Not only did this help establish a safe space for students to study, seek tutoring, and participate in peer counseling, but it also made wellness resources, such as these, less intimidating and more accessible to everyone in our school."

            "Question 9": "As networking culture dominates, even in technical fields, advancement in industry is increasingly tied to who one knows rather than solely what one knows. To empower students from all backgrounds, every student must be allowed an opportunity to form meaningful connections with industry. Additionally, avoiding self-limitation is crucial for an engineer. Students must be exposed to a wide range of opportunities to find a career that suits their skills, interests, and passions. Because of these reasons, Professional Advancement is the SEC pillar that speaks to me. Within the Development Division, the Career Fair Committee especially piqued my interest because of its powerful ability to connect thousands of engineers to recruiters from over 500 companies. I would love to contribute to its mission of empowering students to explore a variety of opportunities and form lasting industry relationships.",
            "Question 10": "During my first year of college, I maintained a manageable balance between schoolwork, social life, and professional development. However, when I got a chance to reflect, I found myself recalling little besides equations and circuit diagrams. Putting all my mental effort into school allowed many critical moments in my life to slip past with no chance of recovery. Over time, I realized the fabric of my memory was tarnished with holes the size of weeks. At this point, I decided to treat recollection as a skill that required training.\nOver the following months, I kept a journal to capture thoughts, emotions, and day-to-day occurrences. Although ultimately a small effort, it led to immeasurable improvements in my time management, emotional maturity, and mental health. As I build upon my journal, I reconstruct a rich tapestry of memories and personal growth.",
            "Question 11": "On the South side of the Denver East High School athletics field stood a bleak 95-foot wall, ridden with lacrosse ball-shaped divots that uncovered decades of graffiti and subsequent cover-up jobs. It was the eyesore of an otherwise beautiful campus.\nAs a football player, the wall was a distraction during practice, but as an aspiring Eagle Scout, it was an opportunity. As the final step to achieving the highest rank in Scouting, I planned, fundraised, executed, and documented a $14,000 Eagle Scout Service Project, designing and constructing a multi-media mural along the wall.\nTo make my idea a reality, I contacted the business community surrounding my school, developing a network of experts for technical advisory. Through a multi-prong fundraising approach, I brought the project to fruition with the help of 25 in-kind and financial donors. Utilizing over 800 volunteer hours, an eyesore was transformed into a powerful testament to the community."

            "Question 10": "When I entered college, my biggest concern revolved around not just making new acquaintances, but cultivating lasting friendships. As someone who identified as an introvert, I understood the necessity of change to achieve this goal. Even though living off campus initially posed a challenge, I took gradual steps by attending on-campus social events and becoming part of various organizations. With time, I grew more at ease with initiating conversations and building meaningful connections with people who have now become my closest friends. Two invaluable skills I acquired through this journey were vulnerability and confidence. Opening up and being my most genuine self with these newfound friends fostered a sense of authenticity in my relationships that transcended superficial interactions. This transformation from introversion to being an overall more extroverted person not only enriched my college experience but also molded me into a more adaptable and well-connected individual.",

Going into this project, I was not too experienced working with a team in a professional setting. I saw this as an opportunity to develop those skills so I could apply it into that project and even in my future career. I took time outside of our team meetings watching tutorials on using SolidWorks and AutoCAD to be successful. I also stepped outside my comfort zone to interact with my teammates and mentors whenever I got the chance to learn as much as I could from them and support them in their own work. Through this experience, I found some of my best friends and it taught me what it takes to be successful as a team.",
            "Question 11": "This past summer, I interned at an Automotive Manufacturing company as a Quality Engineer. During my first couple weeks, I noticed that many parts would go missing or get scrapped with no data to show for. I have always had a passion for data engineering so I took the initiative to implement the plant-wide use of data analytics tools. To do this, I had to pitch the idea to my managers and get the go ahead to start my project which was granted. I then took online courses to learn it myself and become an expert at it so I could create training modules for other engineers at the plant.

            "Question 9": "The Representative Voice pillar means the most to me. As a Youth Representative to the Colorado Public Health Department, I provided youth perspective that made a huge positive impact on getting youth more informed, involved, and engaged in healthcare. As a voice for underserved communities, I helped arrange mobile vaccination resources for middle and high schools. From my experience in the College of Engineering, students are always looking to learn new skills and scrambling to find opportunities to engage in projects. With the SEC, I would propose to implement Engineering-based service projects for the needy that result in real-world experience for our engineers. Being one of the biggest universities in the nation, it is easy for voices to get drowned out. Engineers face a tough academic journey, and the representative voice for students is key to making change where it\u2019s needed and helps improve the quality of experience and education.",
            "Question 10": "Five years ago, I would have never called myself a leader. But today, I tell a different story. It all started with sprints at tennis practice. Coach said fastest one gets to be done with conditioning. I was the fastest one and asked to be done. He asked, \u201cHow are you going to be captain, if you can\u2019t run with the rest of your team?\u201d He was correct. This incident created a drive in me to build my leadership skills. I started encouraging my teammates and helping my coach. Slowly it transformed into deeper interpersonal skills like seeing everyone\u2019s best qualities and advocating for others. I made and still do, a conscious effort to practice my communication, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, and active listening skills. To be successful, I needed to take initiative. Once I did, I had the honor of becoming a compassionate leader, captain, and club president.",
            "Question 11": "Working as a math tutor, I did not feel satisfied with the basic help I was instructed to provide. I genuinely connected and related to my students and wanted to do more. I saw this as an avenue for improvement and implemented personalized study plans. I created each study plan based on a survey of my student's strengths, weaknesses, learning abilities, and constructive criticism for me. I tailored my lessons to be visual vs. logical, incentive-based, made them calendars for time management, etc. This shows my students that I care and am passionate about what I teach. I remember times when I felt great relief after a tutoring session and strived to be that person for someone else. Throughout my sessions, I watched my students' confidence, math abilities, and grades grow and improve. It gives me immense satisfaction and happiness to make this positive difference for them."

This pillar specifically connects to me because I believe that in this rapidly changing world, new technologies and new learning opportunities should be widely available in order to see development in the engineering industry. I firmly believe that I can be a vital member to SEC and help the corporate relations committee as I attained the skills of reaching out to many sponsors when I created a non-profit organization. For the non-profit, I got companies from Europe and India to aid financially in distributing COVID supplies to various under impoverished areas throughout the US and India. I want to contribute to SEC's mission by making a section on the website where students can find various titles associated with each engineering field because the DI Saturday only explains the engineering majors.",
            "Question 10": "I interned at Mingagile where I was tasked with developing a math practice web application. While I had a basic understanding, I knew the role would demand more expertise. On the first day, my manager listed all the softwares that would be necessary to get this website running; unfamiliar terms like Tomcat, Spring Boot, Node JS that sounded completely gibberish to me. Right away, my team researched online workshops and crash courses which would help understanding these tools in detail. Slowly, I started to understand the basis of each program and used that in the back-end of my web application. At SEC, I believe that I will be able to grow and have many new skills to obtain like public speaking and etiquette. From this experience, I learned that there is always room for growth and that I should not be afraid but instead embrace it with a warm welcome.",
            "Question 11": "I interned at Sewa International where I dedicated over 80 hours to aid underpaid refugee families with education, food, and housing. At my time there, the organization was having issues with sufficient food distribution. To combat this issue, I started talking to the Houston Food Bank for volunteer opportunities in making food boxes there with fresh produce and a portion of that would be sent directly to the families my internship was working with. After many back and forth meetings, the food bank agreed to the proposal and we were able to continue our service to the refugee families. From this experience, I gained a vital understanding that no problem is too big that it can\u2019t be solved with a plan and continued effort. SEC is also a non-profit and is partnered with the REACH project where I can continue giving back to the society and help with mutual growth."

Determined to improve, I decided to focus on enhancing my study habits for the second semester. I had heard that studying in groups was effective, so I challenged myself to join friends and attend SI Sessions. Collaborative studying transformed my academic performance, helping boost my confidence with the material and honing in my communication skills as I frequently asked questions and explained concepts to friends. Interacting with people who are in the same boat of trying to learn and get a good grade has really pushed me to do the same and has made me more eager and excited to work in teams compared to my past self.",
            "Question 11": "I was complacent as my highschool\u2019s first-chair clarinet player since I earned it without much effort, but I constantly fell short at All-Region competitions missing the cut for an ensemble. After two years, I took initiative and decided to rework my technique. I've spent numerous hours over the summer unlearning and fixing my muscle memory for my instrument in order to get past the plateau I was stuck on; it was morally debilitating to focus on beginner techniques for numerous hours, but I knew I had to drop my ego and pride to improve. As a result, I went from struggling to make an ensemble to becoming the third-best clarinet player in my area. This experience taught me that even seemingly mundane tasks have meaning in achieving larger goals. It's a reminder that we must embrace roles that others may overlook, as they are crucial to the bigger picture."

I often entered workouts energized and invigorated, but would become dejected halfway through, severely detracting from the quality. I knew this severely impeded progress, and was an issue where avenues for improvement existed. I tirelessly tried solutions, from changing times, to changing orders. Ultimately, I found success in attacking workouts with a burst of intensity rather than dragging them out, as well as not allowing myself to play basketball until I accomplished my tasks. I do not rest until I find the best avenue, not just any avenue, and I relentlessly demand nothing short but my personal best effort at all times. By learning to keep myself accountable, I\u2019ve improved my productivity and attentiveness."

During his final years post-chemotherapy, I noticed what I thought were signs of dementia in my grandpa. With the help of my mentor and Houston Methodist's resources, I isolated the symptoms as not dementia but the phenomenon of \"chemo brain,\" which is often overlooked by healthcare professionals despite its impact on cancer patients' quality of life. In response, I started a non-profit to address the issue, developing an app and website to diagnose and treat chemo brain in affected patients. Overall, the situation taught me valuable skills in engineering and healthcare and how to implement solutions to make a difference in patients' lives."

            "Question 9": "The external pillar which emphasizes engineering awareness is the one that I relate to very personally. My motivation behind attending A&M and pursuing a career in engineering was influenced by TAMU\u2019s Youth Adventure Program for Engineering. This program had introduced me to the various disciplines and inspired my passion for engineering as a career. The exposure and information this program provided gave me a new perspective on engineering as more than simply \u201cbuilding things\u201d. Since then, I am always ecstatic in attending different events such as career fairs or company informationals where I can continue to learn more about engineering careers and what they entail. I strive to also reciprocate my experience to others in helping them gain more exposure and spread knowledge of the significance of this field. I hope to spark this sense of inspiration and curiosity that I once found to the next generation of students.",
            "Question 10": "Inspired by my passion to pursue medicine, I strive to become a physician with the experience of a biomedical engineer to have a different approach to solving problems. Starting my internship at a cardiology and electrophysiology clinic, I had minimal knowledge about these specialties and clinical operations, quickly realizing that I wouldn\u2019t succeed in this internship if I didn\u2019t even know how to operate an EMR system. To ensure I could excel in this position, I took the initiative to stay after hours and research cardiac terminology. Whether it be researching electrophysiological conditions or learning how to interrogate a pacemaker, I spent several days a week expanding my knowledge of these topics, also asking my supervising physician questions any chance I got to help my curiosity or confusion over a topic. My dedication to improvement and learning has significantly helped me become a better scribe and strengthen my work ethic.",
            "Question 11": "I invested significant time throughout my freshman year to be involved in my FLO. As a freshman in the Professional Advancement committee, I was frustrated with the lack of opportunities my FLO provided regarding professional development and industry experience. These flaws had inspired me to become a staff counselor for this organization to implement improvements in areas I found lacking such as inviting guest speakers, ETAM workshops, and even road trips to visit different engineering companies. I am strongly pushing to provide this class of freshmen with better professional opportunities that I never got to experience. By providing these opportunities, I not only provide freshmen with the opportunity to grow in the engineering field, but also help expand my knowledge and curiosity as well. Through this, I hope to contribute to SEC in helping others navigate the field of engineering and continue to develop my professional skill set."

Consequently, I believe it's important to have a platform that will advocate for the unique needs and concerns of the underrepresented departments and their students. Therefore, the pillar of the SEC Mission Statement that means the most to me is the \"Representative Voice\". This pillar stands for the chance to give students in underrepresented majors a voice within the College of Engineering. Being part of the SEC would allow me to actively contribute to making positive changes within these underrepresented majors and create a much-needed sense of belonging. It would also allow me to advocate for resources, support, and opportunities that are not currently available, ultimately helping me achieve my long-term goal that I'm sure I share with many members of our SEC, keeping Texas A&M Engineering at the top, and making a name for myself.",
            "Question 10": "When I was an intern at a technical non-profit career school in Houston called Remington College, I was tasked to co-lead in negotiating an agreement to sign an IT certification provider. This agreement was worth around $210,000 and would help over 300 students gain IT certifications and, ultimately, join the workforce without much debt. Knowing the amount of money at stake, and the amount of students it would help, I knew I had to quickly learn more about the technical operations of legal agreements and successful negotiations. Since I had zero knowledge about this, I allocated a week of time to conduct my research and study any material needed using online resources. I maximized my time efficiency and prepared very well for the occasion, helping us come to a deal with the provider, which helped several students in need get their certification, 70% of whom are now in the workforce.",

Many times over I would lock myself into a routine of classes and only think about the next day. While this was functional in the short term, I would not have been prepared to enter the professional world. The SEC changed this for me. All it took was a few email reminders about summits and Career Fair for me to apply for an internship earlier, buy professional clothes, and start making connections with people I could use later in life. Now, given the chance, I want to have the same effect on others that SEC had on me; to inspire all engineers with a passion to advance and succeed in their professional and personal lives.",
            "Question 10": "Last summer I flew up to Pennsylvania to shadow an orthopedic surgeon. Before I observed a procedure, I met with him to talk about how the shadowing would work. From this conversation, I realized I did not understand the surgical procedures I would be watching and that I would take away less from this experience if I had to learn retroactively. Immediately after the meeting, I asked his coordinator which surgeries he would be performing the next day. I used this knowledge to research each of the procedures he would be performing. Additionally, I purchased an orthopedic anatomy book and memorized everything relevant. The next day I asked the nurses and techs about anything I was confused about, and I was able to fully understand the procedures being performed as I watched. Due to this proactive learning, I still remember the details to this day.",

I was a quality assurance intern, and my job was to review contracts submitted by sales representatives and approve them before the custom was billed and panels were installed. There were many instances where a sales representative would frequently forget to include important information or information would not match up. In order to solve this problem, I created a spreadsheet comparing sales representatives against the information I was checking. Each time a representative would forget to include something I would mark it on the spreadsheet. Eventually, trends began to emerge with employees commonly forgetting a specific aspect of the contract. I brought this up with my manager who relayed it to the sales manager. Very quickly I noticed the contracts had fewer errors and my job became much more efficient and streamlined."

Many engineering students excel in the academics of science, math, and technology; however, many need help with earning the skills required to become competitive professionals. During High School, I was shy and had insecurities during my first-ever job interviews. When I started attending career events sponsored by the SEC, such as Industry nigh and the Engineering Career Fair, I learned to foster soft skills that helped me land my first internship right out of Freshman year. There is just so much that is taught at school regarding professional growth. Therefore, the SEC provides a grand opportunity for engineering students to get out and learn to become competitive candidates for organizations that seek to improve the world through engineering.",
            "Question 10": "After taking a couple of coding classes in High School, I had the confidence to join different programming projects when I came to A&M. However, I realized the hard way that I only knew so much. There would be a high learning curve during some of the projects. After quitting my first hackathon with my team after a lack of experience, I decided to self-learn in front-end languages for the next one. Then, when I attended Tamuhack, I was able to turn in a running project with my team through hard work and a lot of immersive learning. I learned two programming languages and some project management skills that have helped me be involved in a couple of projects by the Aggie Coding Club. After these experiences, I have become a better problem-solver and leader in my work.",

There, I would take on many responsibilities in the IT and quality departments with little to no training. I learned everything I needed to complete a program I was assigned to write and the data analysis I would do for the company\u2019s database. After seeing many technicians in the plant struggle to use the main routing interface, I decided to propose a solution to my manager. I developed a sheet cheat with common error messages and spent some time training a Language Model that would serve as a virtual tutor for new hires. Although I did not get the authorization to use it on the company\u2019s server, I helped fellow employees learn how to use their software more efficiently and worked to secure their digital security through password management."

Engineering has so many applications across fields and it\u2019s crucial that people, especially younger students, are introduced to its possibilities. I would love to get involved with the SEC\u2019s EnVision conference or Industry Nights to be more active in this form of service at A&M - I know I would\u2019ve missed out on a lot of opportunities if not for people who wanted to share their knowledge, and it would be really rewarding to be that person for someone else.",
            "Question 10": "When I started my job at Mathnasium, I realized that knowing math wasn\u2019t enough; I had to learn how to teach it. Two things were standing in my way: communicating and the Mathnasium method. Teaching kids can introduce many issues, especially when they aren\u2019t interested in being there or become too involved in conversations. In addition, I wasn\u2019t used to the terminology used in the Mathnasium method since it was made for kids to understand basic concepts. I initially struggled with adapting, but soon I recognized my struggle points and sought to improve them. I accomplished these improvements by learning techniques from coworkers more experienced than me and explaining ideas with Mathnasium terminology at any chance that I got. Eventually, with practice, I became more comfortable in the environment and developed patience and communication skills that still apply to my life today.",

During my senior year of high school, I took an upper-level physics class where I was the only girl in the room. In this class, I had been told in multiple different situations that I had only gotten into certain schools because I was a girl or that I would fail in engineering because I wasn\u2019t smart enough. After experiencing a fraction of the frustration that girls feel when they grow up enjoying more \u201cmasculine\u201d subjects, I have always been passionate about trying to help younger girls feel comfortable and confident in pursuing whichever pathways they are passionate about. The many stereotypes that still surround the field of engineering today, such as personality and gender, has driven me to try to change the perception that people have of engineers.",
            "Question 10": "During my freshman year, I had spent the entirety of the first semester simply going through the motions and counting down the days until I got to go home.

Through collaborating with the team, we implemented a new payment management system. By insisting only online payments for dues, we better tracked our money flow. Additionally, through creating a confirmation message system, a member received a notice that they paid and it will be noted in our database immediately. Through consistent and effective communication about payments and an organized tracking system, we gained back trust from our members while increasing our membership."

            "Question 9": "SEC's mission for professional advancement means the most to me.\nKnowing nothing but my junior year high school pre-calculus knowledge, having no programming software installed, and not a remote idea of how to code, my start at A&M was among the biggest challenges I have faced so far. During my freshman year, I also decided to attend the Fall 2022 career fair. While receiving the line \"We don't hire freshmen, sorry!\" from almost every hire, the experience helped me become confident and personable. In short, no matter how behind I felt at the start, the SEC provided me with opportunities to catch up and race to the front of the line. The events throughout the year, including Industry Nights, and DI Saturdays helped me realize my potential and figure out what steps I needed to take to set myself up on the right path when I thought I had none.",
            "Question 10": "My very first time working as a swim instructor was nothing but a train wreck. Kids were screaming and jumping off the walls, and I am pretty sure those kids came out that day worse than before the lesson began. Having competitively swam for 10+ years prior, I was surprised and disappointed in myself.\nAfter my first nightmare lesson, I decided that I needed more than just my training knowledge to get these kids to swim. That night I probably spent three hours researching lessons, videos, and activities to hopefully control the class and make the swimming experience enjoyable and safe for everyone. I decided to prepare each night by reading the class levels and creating a game plan for what we would be doing the next day.\nTurns out that teaching a kid to float is a lot harder than swimming 4,000 yards at my own practice.",
            "Question 11": "I failed my first Calculus 2 exam. Not \"failed\"- failed. I got a 52. This absolutely crushed me, because not only did I study day and night for this exam, but I walked into the room confident in my abilities. After the exam... not so much.\nThe experience helped me realize that I could not rely on my own study methods to understand a complex topic, and needed to find help. It was time to make a change in order to prove to myself that I was capable of getting an A.\nIn order to complete this mission, I began utilizing A&M resources like MLC, HOGU, and office hours. I was so afraid to ask for help for fear that I would be subjected to another person's judgment.\nSoon, I improved and progressed and realized that, at times, some problems are easier to tackle with the help of others."

            "Question 9": "While each of the three pillars contributes equally to supporting the foundation of the Student Engineering Council, it is the first pillar that resonates with me the most: striving to be a representative voice for all engineering students. Constructing a cohesive voice for all engineering students is crucial to enhancing current student experience at TAMU. The strength of this voice lies in its invaluable ability to bring to light concerns from the student body. One of the best parts of A&M is the diversity in people's experiences and interests within the engineering department, however, it can be difficult to make each of these voices feel heard. I remember feeling a little lost my freshman year in a department so large, and so I admire how the SEC channels these voices into one unified platform built with the purpose of recognizing and addressing the needs and desires of our student community.",
            "Question 10": "Over the summer, I worked as a barista at a cafe. This role naturally entailed interacting with many customers throughout the course of each shift. I've always leaned toward the more introverted side, so initially, I was anxious about having to talk to that many people. However, I soon recognized that the ability to converse with ease and confidence was a valuable skill with applications in both my personal life and future career. To develop these skills, I asked to be placed in the cashier position more often and began focusing on active listening to ensure I responded thoroughly to any customer question. In the end, I learned that developing these soft skills was just a matter of practice. Now when I feel hesitant to begin a task due to the fear of imperfection, I remind myself of this lesson that by simply starting and practicing, things gradually improve.",
            "Question 11": "In high school, I was involved in the UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) chapter of my school. During meeting presentations, we would inform members of current issues going on around the world. I noticed that for most of the students, it was the first time they were hearing about these problems that so heavily affected others worldwide. This disconnect between students and the world around them encouraged me to establish the Committee of Advocacy within the club. The goal of this committee was to bridge the gap between students and the global and local injustices occurring. We worked on raising awareness about these issues and providing our members with actionable steps toward addressing them. To make information more accessible to students outside the club, we began creating Instagram posts, designed to be easily digestible by students, thereby reducing levels of ignorance surrounding these crucial matters."

            "Question 9": "Out of the three pillars, the professional development of engineers appeals to me the most. Transitioning from the academic environment of classes, tests, etc. into the professional world is something most engineers aspire to do. I have personal experience on how demanding managing both responsibilities can be - switching from classes to interviews to labs. I want to make this experience better for future students by developing more opportunities and expanding existing ones. I would specifically reach out to recruiters to bring more networking events with valuable companies to Texas A&M, because I\u2019ve personally found those events especially useful. I would also improve existing events such as the career fair to value student\u2019s times better. One improvement I would make is developing an interactive map that would help students find the companies they\u2019re interested in. This, along with many other opportunities exist to improve the student\u2019s experience.",
            "Question 10": "I am a firm believer in the idea that the more I feel like my skills aren't enough, the more I will aspire to grow. One circumstance where this really tested me was in my internship where I, along with three other groupmates, were selected to develop an encryption module for civilian radios. This project required a lot of research and analysis on our part as I realized that I, nor my groupmates, had the necessary knowledge for this project. I helped take the initiative by setting up a discord where we communicated daily, talking and researching how radio systems worked. With hard work and dedication, I believe I was able to create a successful system that worked well that made our project sponsors and supervisors very happy. The biggest skill I learned here was the ability to find information about what I need, which I believe is transferrable everywhere.",
            "Question 11": "As someone who hates repetitive tasks, I am always looking for solutions to improve my quality of life and give me and others more time to spend elsewhere. One instance of this was in my freshman year summer internship, where I helped an employee, whose job was to manage paperwork for equipment such as trucks, cranes, trailers, etc. She had a heap of paperwork that she constantly referred to when working that she herself was too busy to organize. I came in and developed a system that not only protects the paperwork, but also organizes them by location and other information so that they were easily accessible. My supervisor was extremely happy with the solution I implemented for her. Through this, I developed valuable communication skills that helped me communicate with others to deliver something they need."

It wasn\u2019t until I joined Science Olympiad in high school that I was introduced to material science and discovered I could combine my passion of chemistry with real-world applications in engineering.\nI was so excited learning about material science but wouldn\u2019t have known about it without the club introducing me in the first place. I want to be able to replicate this initial excitement with so many more people. Events like DI Saturday, Engineers\u2019 Week and especially the Envision conference, provide an avenue to reach out to people who\u2019ve considered engineering but weren\u2019t sure which one to specialize in or even people who\u2019ve never considered it in the first place. In engineering, there\u2019s always a place for everybody.",
            "Question 10": "This summer, I joined an MSEN research program, tasked with designing an IV characterization setup to measure thin-film devices. Going into this though, I knew little about devices or characterization in general.\nTo address this gap, I learned everything about the set-up\u2019s capabilities, letting me lay out concrete goals. I decided my main goal would be automizing the characterization tests, normally taking 1-2 hours each. Throughout this, self-learning and hands-on experience were key. I taught myself LabVIEW through online tutorials, then applied those skills directly to my set-up. Additionally, I consulted with my graduate mentor, an expert in this area, to leverage their guidance and expertise.\nThe outcome was a LabVIEW program which automatically ran tests, saving 1-2 hours of work per future test. Furthermore, I learned about developing myself as a researcher by improving my independent problem-solving skills and reinforcing the importance of teamwork in achieving common goals.",
            "Question 11": "Unlike most engineering labs, my MSEN labs demand more extensive, formal reports spanning multiple weekly sessions. One essential component for these labs is designing graphs that are clear and presentable. However, making the exact format the professor expects can be a long and tedious process.\nIn my section however, I opted to streamline the process by implementing the skills I learned in MATLAB during my summer research program. I developed a program which generates the graphs automatically, exactly in the professor\u2019s style. Consequently, what used to take 45-60 minutes per section in each report, can now be accomplished instantly with a single 45-minute investment in code creation.\nThis experience taught me the value of thinking outside the box and being open to new solutions and methodologies. Furthermore, it\u2019s extremely satisfying being able to use my unique skills to help my team in a way that benefits us as a group."

Throughout my freshman year, I was unsure of my major. Going from biomedical to industrial, to finally choosing mechanical engineering, I hadn\u2019t formed an association with a specific area of study and was anxious about the future. The SEC provides awareness for all engineers, with External relations opportunities such as Engineers Week to promote the well-being of the students and address thoughts of uncertainty they may be facing. Also, Engineering Development shines a light on an area of interest for engineers who don\u2019t have a set-in-stone path. Contributing towards engineering awareness with the SEC would allow me to help students navigate their undergraduate journey and figure out what they want to do with engineering, as I understand firsthand how crucial it is for their development and success.",
            "Question 10": "During the summer of my freshman year, I realized that my communication and networking skills needed to be improved. I didn\u2019t know how to convey myself when talking to recruiters and had trouble explaining my resume in the best way possible. To prepare for college interviews, I underwent a self-training period to gain familiarity with these qualities. I used websites such as LinkedIn Learning and Reddit to learn how to talk about my past experiences and understand what recruiters look for in an undergraduate student. I discovered techniques such as the elevator pitch and had multiple mock interviews which allowed me to obtain some experience and shake off the nerves. Today, the skills I developed over the summer have helped me substantially when networking with recruiters at the engineering career fairs. In addition, I increased my confidence when communicating during interviews and learning new things on my own.",
            "Question 11": "Throughout my freshman fall semester, I fell short of the aspiring goals I had set for myself. I aimed for all A\u2019s, consistency in the gym and active involvement in clubs and TAMU itself. However, due to poor calendar/time management and trying to be perfect in all three, it was hard to maintain all these commitments. I couldn\u2019t connect with a single club, my GPA was below the ETAM auto-admission cutoff, and slacked in the gym. To address this, I devised a solution: I dedicate a few hours every Sunday to plan and organize my weekly activities. Instead of rushing between class, club meetings, and the gym, I gained self-awareness and control of my schedule. Ultimately, I was able to achieve a small part of my goals and eventually surpass the GPA cutoff. This approach still guides my actions today and has been useful in managing my time effectively."

            "Question 10": "During my internship last summer, I encountered a situation where I realized I lacked certain technical skills that the more experienced interns possessed. Initially, it felt intimidating to step into a world where my knowledge was largely theoretical. Everything I had learned was from a textbook with no real world context. However, I was determined to bridge the gap. In my free time, I pursued supplemental learning to enhance my technical skills - Coursera must\u2019ve put me on some kind of watchlist for all the different free trials I had. I also took the initiative to attend extra meetings and proactively scheduled feedback sessions with my supervisors. These actions demonstrated my commitment to going the extra mile, even when my knowledge was lacking. Over time, my dedication paid off as I not only acquired the necessary skills but also showcased my ability to adapt and thrive in a challenging environment.",
            "Question 11": "Entering university, I grappled with emerging mental health issues. The most challenging aspect was recognizing that there was an issue.. This ego-driven denial affects many of us regardless of the area we seek to enhance. Once I acknowledged the problem, I embarked on a systematic journey to recovery. Small acts of kindness and heartfelt conversations with my parents became vital metrics for improvement.\nMy engineering mindset drove me to approach this issue with a structured methodology. I aspire to inspire my peers to embrace this approach. Acknowledging our struggles and not harboring shame in our failures can be the most potent catalyst for growth. I aim to foster a culture where seeking help and pursuing well-being are considered acts of strength, not weakness.

Personally, DI Saturdays allowed me to choose my major and Career Fair/workshops gave me confidence to earn my first internship. Professionally, young engineers often lack skills necessary for success like communication, leadership, or even confidence. I want to change this stigma and promote the resources available to students from SEC. Two weeks ago, I did this by being a panelist for students curious about the Career Fair. I was excited to not only ease students\u2019 anxieties but develop students to successfully connect with recruiters and market themselves well, just as I did. I want to share these available opportunities from SEC to students to cultivate Texas A&M as the premiere university for talented, successful and professional engineers.",
            "Question 10": "As an engineer, creativity is necessary in problem solving. However, I felt dull and burnt out the older I was in my academic career, failing to think outside the box or fill a blank conversation. I took it upon myself to build this creativity by culturing myself with classic literature that challenged the psychology of just being, giving me a break from constant STEM discussions. I read books from \u201c1984\u201d, to \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Grey\u201d, to even the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series. Since this initiation, I have earned a perception of reality that carries into lively conversations with others, especially company recruiters. Additionally, I am able to motivate my imagination to be not only more engaged in previously dull lectures but critically analyze and appreciate the science behind the theory. Altogether this approach has developed me as a stronger, more creative engineer, anticipating challenges to solve.",

In the beginning, there were several events and delegated assignments from higher executives. With strict deadlines, there was confusion on when and where events, deadlines, and meetings took place. Although we had a GroupMe, members struggled to keep up with deadlines and events despite appropriate assignment timelines. I resolved this by creating a \u201cTo-Do\u201d spreadsheet of assignments with deadlines for each member to confirm they completed a task. Lastly, to keep up with busy schedules, I created a shared Google calendar that members could add to their own to see when assignments were due as well as events and locations. This immensely improved the productivity of my organization as members were able to focus on completing their tasks in an organized manner as well as developing personal time management skills."

My initial approach to the problem was to double down on all my standard efforts: attend available office hours, increase my independent textbook study, and work through practice problems. However, I quickly realized I needed an additional skill, so I tried something new. To meet my learning style needs, I worked with a professional engineering tutor for a few sessions. Over the next few weeks, I improved my learning method and flexibility in approaching engineering problems. By the end of the course, I not only gained knowledge of the topic and turned my grade around, but my newfound approach and study methods allowed me to implement them in future classes.",

I had two leading roles, one in aluminum nitride substrate polishing using the current methods and the other in research and development of innovative solutions to post-production substrate total thickness variation. By participating in the current polishing process, I identified the sources of variation and chose an alternative polishing method to improve the substrate's total thickness variation. From there, I tested the new polishing process to see if it suited the production needs and enhanced the substrate's properties. The research results indicated that my new polishing method worked, but there needed to be more research done to make it commercially applicable. I ended the summer with a new approach to reducing total thickness variation with encouraging results and a plan for future improvements to the problem."

My groupmates assisted me with my portion of the assignment and explained to me the topics that I was not familiar with. While my group helped me to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to complete the assigned work, the most valuable knowledge that I gained from them was to never be too proud to ask others for help.",
            "Question 11": "In the spring semester of my freshman year, I applied for and joined a women\u2019s engineering organization. Within a few months, I was elected into a leadership position and took on several responsibilities to serve within my organization as well as chair a committee. After looking into the constitution and bylaws governing our chapter, I saw that my position had less responsibilities than I anticipated, and I saw an opportunity to grow my position to one that improved and elevated my organization. I scheduled a meeting with an executive to become more educated on the possible changes I could make to our bylaws. I communicated with the members of my committee and implemented a plan to take on more responsibilities that would promote and cultivate our organization\u2019s public image. Throughout this semester, I have grown my leadership position into something much more beneficial than it was originally intended to be."

            "Question 9": "The pillar that means the most to me is how the SEC strives to be the representative voice of all engineering students. As a part of a population that has been constantly marginalized throughout history, and still to this day, I have not only seen but I have felt what underrepresentation feels like. I know what it is like to not have the platform or confidence to voice my opinions and ideas. Because of this, I feel it is important that everyone be able to use their voice, and that everyone deserves to be heard. We grow through learning things from others, but this cannot happen and will not happen without hearing the ideas and views of everyone including those of minority populations.",
            "Question 10": "All throughout high school I never had to study when it came to understanding different subjects. I would simply do the work and be fine. When I first entered college I knew that I was not going to be able to use the same strategies, but I also did not have any different study habits. My first semester freshman year I struggled greatly with this. I tried common study habits such as flashcards or re-writing all of my notes. These methods did not cut it however. I eventually did become successful after reaching out to my peers. They would give me examples of how they study and I tried them out, eventually learning my own ways. Through my trials and errors I learned that reaching out for help is not a sign of weakness, but instead a way to better yourself and your habits with the help of others.",
            "Question 11": "In my student organization, I hold a position on the standards board. Though we had formerly tried to change the view others had on us, the board was intimidating, though our true mission was to uphold the image and values of our organization. We decided that we wanted to change the lens that all of our fellow members saw us through. We wanted standards to be known as a place to go to that is trustworthy rather than just purely discipline. So, I then collaborated with the rest of the standards team, and fostered the creation of the \"Sunshine Committee\" which strives to bring positivity to the chapter through fun activities among members. By bringing positivity to the chapter there has been a positive change in the moral of the chapter and a notable shift in the attitude towards the standards board."

At the start of college, finding community was daunting, especially in such a time-consuming and competitive department as engineering. I believe that \u201cengineering awareness\u201d is a professional term for a multi-faceted goal: to remind each engineer in the College of Engineering of the strong, driven, and supportive community they\u2019re a part of and to extend that community to others. SEC celebrates and encourages engineers during E-Week, spreads the joy of experimenting, learning, and innovating through EnVision, builds personal connections to the meaning of being an engineer serving the community through SEC\u2019s philanthropy. With all the busy schedules and stress that accompanies engineering, I believe engineering awareness events are fundamental to reminding us of the \u201cwhy\u201d behind our choice to pursue engineering: helping others.

            "Question 10": "This summer, I improved my software development skills as an intern, specifically in the C# language. Having no prior knowledge of C#, I was put in a challenging position where I had to learn the language, while also building the project and meeting the deadlines set. Because I wanted to be prepared for my role, I completed an online C# course before starting my internship to get a basic understanding of the language. From there, I broke the project outline down into several solvable parts. I worked through errors patiently by searching online, studying code from the company\u2019s other features, and asking my co-workers for help. I made efforts to schedule code reviews with my supervisor to make my code more dynamic, readable, and reusable. When the project was completed, I felt like I had become more proficient in C#, but also more confident in my ability to overcome challenges.",
            "Question 11": "Over the summer, I was involved in an internship, Fish Camp, and two summer classes. There were times when I felt overwhelmed by the work I had to complete. Rather than staying overwhelmed or giving up an experience, I chose to manage my stress and commit to my responsibilities. I found that building a schedule was most effective in maximizing focus and ensuring work completion. I did coursework in the morning, worked at my internship during the day, and completed Fish Camp assignments at night. I made efforts to stick to this schedule to stay organized and consistent, but there were times when I had to reevaluate my schedule. During those times, I designated times to complete whatever I missed or used other methods like exercise to relieve stress. Because of this strategy, I improved my ability to multitask, stay organized, and give my best to commitments I made."

            "Question 9": "My journey from India to the US for college exposed me to stark cultural differences in how engineers and the IT industry are perceived. In the US, there is a prevalent stereotype that engineering is solely a male profession, and unlike in India, my passion for computer science was met with skepticism rather than equal acceptance.\nAs a result of this societal conditioning, I often feel underestimated and overshadowed by my peers. I feel that I am right where I should be in respect to my decision to pursue engineering due to the support from my parents, but many girls here lack such encouragement. Boys are steered toward analytical thinking through toys like Legos, while girls are given dolls, reinforcing traditional gender roles. I firmly believe that increasing engineering awareness among women and reshaping societal expectations can unlock countless untapped talents in STEM.",
            "Question 10": "The fast-paced HPE environment during my internship at LTIMindTree offered little hands-on guidance, particularly during my initial Pricing Analysis project.\nI dedicated weeks to self-guided learning, immersing myself in Python, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning through online courses. As the project began, I encountered challenges in data analysis, authentication processes, and data cleaning. My mentor, an experienced professional, introduced more efficient methods, uncovering optimization opportunities.\nIn the exploratory time-series forecasting project, I diverged from my mentor's work, meticulously evaluating every aspect of the model. I attempted data normalization techniques like square rooting and box-cox transformations. While the initial results appeared promising, a closer look revealed the predictions were scaled down, requiring corrective actions. Ultimately, my model's performance aligned with my mentor's, but the journey of exploration and discovery proved immensely rewarding.",
            "Question 11": "The transition from high school to college, especially the move from India to the US, was a harsh adjustment. In my freshman year, I was driven by a fear of failure and a desire to connect with peers, leading me to prioritize studying and socializing while neglecting self-care.\nBy second semester, I realized a change was necessary. I committed to attending more events with FALL, while still balancing my academic responsibilities. I found the camaraderie of FALL to be especially rewarding, so I became an executive the following semester.\nI began scheduling daily moments for self-care such as eating, relaxing, calling my parents, and personal downtime, even if it was just for 30 minutes. This routine improved my mental well-being and strengthened my relationships with those around me. I hope I can use my personal experience to help fellow engineering peers manage their studies while also prioritizing their mental and physical health."

Recognizing the severe financial strain it imposed on retail workers and those living paycheck to paycheck, I shifted my focus to aid families in the Greater Houston area who had lost their jobs and were struggling to provide food for their families. I initiated a non-perishable food drive but soon realized that families required more than food items; many lacked essential Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Collaborating with SEWA International, I secured a donation of 500+ washable face masks. With food items and PPE in hand, I organized a team of six scouts to assemble and distribute over 100 goody bags, containing PPE and non-perishable food items, to areas severely affected by the pandemic."

Initially, I faced the challenges of coordinating our group and planning activities, quickly realizing the difficulty of effective communication with our Freshman members. Our group's attendance dwindled, and enthusiasm waned.\nTo address this, I reached out to my mentors from the previous year, acknowledging that advice from those with prior experience was invaluable. Following their guidance, we implemented multiple communication channels to engage our members, such as GroupMe and Slack. This change led to an immediate and noticeable turnaround in our group's participation and interest. This experience highlighted the importance of communication as a cornerstone of effective leadership and taught me the significance of seeking mentorship and adapting strategies when facing challenges.",

We were a group of young, motivated individuals collaborating on tasks, but we faced a difficult task right at the start. Only one person could access the primary files at a time, and we all had pressing deadlines. Recognizing the need for efficiency, I proposed a solution: I suggested dividing the files into sections, enabling each team member to focus on a specific part and then switch to the next. This strategy transformed our workflow, not only ensuring the completion of our tasks but also significantly accelerating our progress. It was a valuable lesson in real-world problem-solving, teamwork, and maximizing efficiency in a challenging environment."

By fostering professional advancement for all engineering students, each individual within the college has a support system behind them; wanting them to succeed. Even the pillars of representative voice and engineering awareness, build upon each other to eventually lead to the end goal of professional advancement. I strongly believe in this pillar as I feel it shows proof of the long lasting strength of the Aggie network, community, and family. Aggies supporting other Aggies and their futures, was one of the main reasons I chose TAMU to be my home when deciding on colleges. Now I would like to give back and be a part of that support system, and help other Aggies achieve the dreams they have dedicated their lives to.",
            "Question 10": "I realized that I needed additional skills/knowledge very recently in order to be successful in my major. This semester, classes deepening into my major have shown their difficulty and commitment needed to do well. Whenever I had trouble, visits to my Professors and TAs to gain clarification only occurred on occasion, but studying improvements and full understanding never happened until exams neared. This semester I made it a point to make that previous mindset become nonexistent. I knew after the first weeks that change would need to be made for success in my classes. So with time-management for the orgs I am currently a part of; each and every day, time studying and visiting office hours go into all of my classes. The hope is that this approach will continue to help me gain the necessary skills to be successful both within my major and onwards into my career.",
            "Question 11": "Over the past years, it has taken increasingly more effort to comfortably talk/meet new people on a consistent basis. I truly feel that one of my biggest weaknesses is how less outgoing I've become. This weakness has really pigeonholed my growth as a person, which has led to complacency and want to stay in environments that I know or feel comfortable in. A big reason why I decided to apply for SEC is because of my desire to overcome this weakness and improve myself, as well as developing into a professional engineer. By getting more involved with organizations at TAMU, I truly believe it will ultimately foster the growth of being more comfortable and improving upon my weakness. Within this strong community of leaders at the SEC, I can learn to embrace the uncomfortable while being surrounded by so much support that will drive me to change for the better."

I thought about how to minimize both problems and came up with the 1:1 ratio. This solution worked by having people only respond to one question and having one argument to support their decision at a time. This solution ensured everyone could speak. After two weeks of this solution, I slowly changed the ratio so people could make two arguments. I was happy that I could implement a solution that worked best for everyone by gaining insight into people's problems. Overall, my answer led to more efficient discussions, and the changes I implemented resulted in positive feedback."

I feel as though I, of course being an engineer, have not had the proper opportunity to professionally develop myself the way I wish to. This is something I would love to see encouraged and offered to everyone in the college of engineering. The transition period that college is, is such a crucial time for growth and maturity both in one\u2019s character and in their education. The send off from college into the real world is a substantial part of everyone\u2019s life. That\u2019s why this area speaks to me, because it has so much weight behind it. Professionalism goes beyond college, it follows you for your entire career. This time for growth and preparation should be capitalized on, and I think SEC can successfully assist so many bright minds in preparing for their futures.",
            "Question 10": "One time I learned I wasn\u2019t ready for the job was the first time I used a weed whacker. Stupid yes, but those things are more intricate than you\u2019d think. Rewiring, priming, and overall handling the machine is a doozy. Without the help of my dad in person, I had to take a step back and figure the thing out for myself. I knew this would take research, trial & error, and sharp communication with my dad. So, I sat down and got to work. Trying to text with my dad, and find videos on the 20 year old model we had was tough, so I really had to show out. After literally deconstructing the thing for twenty minutes to rewire and gas it, I finally got her running. The process was unlike any academic experience I\u2019ve had, and I felt my problem solving got me through it.",

I was heartbroken because not only could I not play the sport I loved in an organized manner, but I also had to be separated from my teammates and friends. During this time, many of the people around me used it as an avenue to basically waste their days away. I saw this time as an opportunity to improve on something I was extremely passionate about and began going out to my local field and improving my skills for hours every day. When High School sports eventually resumed I not only made the Varsity team but was named a starter."

My approach to gain the needed skills was to use relevant online resources such as the official SolidWorks \"help\" database, and to research new methods like SolidWorks' integrated force analysis software to test components. If there was something I was struggling to figure out myself, mentors on my team would help me find the next step to take. Soon, I will pursue an advanced SolidWorks certification to gain even more knowledge about 3D modeling.",
            "Question 11": "A couple summers ago I was working as a server at Pinstack, a local \"eat and play\" type of bowling alley. One of the most popular items on our menu were our large, craft milkshakes, but oftentimes we did not have someone at the milkshake bar ready to make them and customers regularly had to wait far too long. This was because the job was typically offloaded to the host at the restaurant section, and it was no easy task making sure customers were being seated while also responding to every server's requests to make a milkshake. I realized that the whole process could be streamlined if servers could just make milkshakes themselves during the downtime we often had. So, I consolidated our milkshake recipes onto a piece of paper and put it up by our milkshake bar for servers to reference and customer wait times were reduced significantly."

Each year, we would choose an international cause and donate the entirety of the profits raised from the festival, but hosting unaffiliated clubs at the festival proved a challenge for our profits. In order to circumvent the losses these tables introduced, we developed a ticket system that not only increased organization, but also our yields. Because our monetary system changed from dollars to tickets, festival attendees were forced to purchase concession tickets, and though they may not use all their tickets, they had already purchased the tickets that went to our cause. This solution also removed all handling of money from non-staff members who ran tables, which decreased risks involved with all levels of our structure."

I took a look at the bike and I was unable to initially fix the problem, so I decided to take it into the shop where I got it and ask someone for their guidance. I was able to get an answer to my question and I used their guidance to buy what I needed and fix the problem. I found that reaching out to someone and asking for help was the best method to find a solution to my problem, and by doing this I was able to learn a valuable life skill.",
            "Question 11": "Over the past year, I have had to make various changes to my habits in order to be successful. I realized after my first semester that I was not being prepared enough for my classes and that I had to change something if I wanted to be successful in my future years here at A&M. I spent time over the winter break researching better ways to stay organized, better study methods, and how to have a better balance between school and social life. After taking some time researching and talking to older students, I was able to come into the spring semester with a better mindset, having the goal in mind to improve from the previous semester. Using what I learned allowed me to greatly improve in my spring semester, where I saw academic improvement and social improvement."

            "Question 9": "The pillar of being the representative voice for engineering students stands out to me as the most meaningful. I think students being able to express their interests outside of class in the many clubs, design teams, and other engineering organizations is a very important way to learn and grow while having fun; by talking with members from other ESOs about what is and isn't working, how to best care for and grow the members, and working to improve the well-being of members and the organization, we can provide a positive environment for students to hang out, hone skills, and work as a team to achieve something bigger than themselves.\nThis is especially possible in SEC, as it is such a prominent engineering organization with a great system in place to impact as many ESOs as possible.",
            "Question 10": "Early in my freshman year, I was heavily struggling with time management. Managing my time between classes, the Corps, and various other organizations was especially difficult, as they were becoming increasingly intensive, with higher standards and bigger time commitments. One Wednesday night, I realized something needed to change, and that I simply didn't have the skills and systems in place to manage it all. I decided to spend a good amount of time researching different methods to manage time and figure out what I needed to do and what I just wanted to do. I ended up learning a lot about--and implementing--Google Calendar, the Pomodoro Technique, and the Eisenhower Matrix, among others. Ultimately, I had to struggle with time management in order to learn how to manage it effectively, and now I would say I have systems in place that allow me to maximize the 24 hours in the day.",

As the Corps is a leadership organization, I took the opportunity to take charge and make necessary changes that would help the following year run smoother, all to best develop the incoming freshmen. I recognized a lot of the things we were made to do as freshmen as purposeless, and I wanted that to change, because with power comes responsibility and a command to lead ethically.\nAs the leader of my class, I have worked to make sure we all put in high levels of effort every day, established accountability methods, and checked in on my class members to ensure that they are feeling well and have the appropriate resources and care to best lead others."

I chose engineering on a whim, but as my freshman year progressed, through Industry Nights and DI Saturdays, I gained a new level of awareness. As I enter my first year in Computer Engineering, I can see the impact making an informed choice has on my education.\nMy initial lack of engineering awareness is why I am a firm proponent of it now. But instead of adding to the impact SEC has, I could multiply their reach. External committees are hindered by manpower. Kids can only gain awareness during SEC\u2019s events, but by developing online modules, students could increase their awareness asynchronously, vastly increasing the reach and impact that the engineering awareness has.\nEngineering awareness allows youth to discover their passion, and make a conscious decision in setting their course in life.",
            "Question 10": "As track captain during high school, I felt a personal responsibility to treat our most glaring issue: we had no tangible way to celebrate a win. As I watched the Olympics one day, I realized what we were missing. That feeling of being at the top of a medal podium validated the feeling of winning a race.\nI decided to create a podium, but I quickly realized I was in over my head. A few failed designs later, I recognized that I needed outside expertise. After consulting with various engineers, I learned the engineering design process, and how to accommodate the projected stress load in my design.\nTo create my podium, I had to recognize my limitations in knowledge and have the foresight to consult people more knowledgeable than I. More than that, it enabled my teammates to feel pride and foster their sense of accomplishment.",

I knew I wanted to raise money, but fundraisers had been temporarily halted due to COVID. Instead I chose to opt for a charity fun run; by staggering participants\u2019 starts, I would be able to keep them at a safe distance from one another, as well as creating an effective fundraiser to raise money.\nBut the most gratifying part was seeing the direct impact of this money- a month of hard work for me had translated into ~200 meals that these kids would not have eaten otherwise."

When I first started attending Texas A&M at Galveston, I decided that I needed to spend most of my time pursing a perfect GPA, even if it was at the expense of my physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. I soon realized that because of my current habits, such as not taking care of my basic human needs, the perfect GPA that I was pursuing was slowly slipping away. After my first semester wrapped up, I took time over winter break to reflect on my decisions and habits of the prior semester. I soon realized that every human has basic needs that absolutely cannot be neglected. When the spring semester started, I began going back to the gym, reading books leisurely, and finally getting involved on campus. Essentially, I started taking better care of myself.",

I soon realized that there was a complete different academic skill curve comparing high school to college, and I realized that my current ways of functioning simply wont cut it. I began reflecting on how I can better improve my academic performance. After a while of pondering, I noticed that my organizational skills were sub par in the sense that I did not plan out my day at all, I never read and organized my emails, and finally I never organized my school work and lecture notes to be easy to read and accessible. Realizing your own flaws is the first step for self improvement, and once I realized my flaws, I started committing to organizing my leisure and work life"

As of March 9, 2022, 15.9% of engineers are female compared to 84.1% of engineers being male in the United States. Promoting gender diversity helps eradicate long-standing barriers and stereotypes, creating a more inclusive community. Diversity in groups is also recognized for developing more innovative solutions by embracing alternate points of view. This is seen in the Executive Council of the SEC, where we have a diverse team of 15 women and 14 men. Additionally, practicing engineering awareness helps the next generation to be motivated to pursue professions in engineering through the presence of role models and achievements of women. Ultimately, engineering awareness empowers people, especially women, fosters diversity, and prepares society to tackle challenging issues.",

I had the privilege of being mentored when I was working on creating an app for my church with a group of engineers. I was able to gain knowledge in several facets of app development, such as coding, user interface design, and project management. The mentorship included regular meetings, where I proactively absorbed knowledge and participated in conversations. This mentoring relationship not only sped up my learning process but also considerably improved the team's overall capabilities, which was crucial to the successful creation of the app. Being able to communicate openly, ask constant questions, and know that it's okay to fail helped me succeed in doing my part. Overall, being mentored led me to learn valuable skills, helped me gain insight into the creative process of developing an app, and guided me to grow as an individual.",
            "Question 11": "An area of my life I needed to improve on was mindfulness and meditation. Focusing on the present moment has numerous positive effects on a person's mental, emotional, and physical well-being. When I was not actively practicing these skills, I experienced higher levels of stress, a disorganized lifestyle, and an unfocused mind. Adding mindfulness into my everyday life helped me cultivate self-awareness, increased concentration, and improved overall mental resilience. Every day, I find a quiet, comfortable space for me to clear my mind and spend some time alone. Whether it's eating a meal alone, studying alone, or just walking to class and enjoying nature. As I have incorporated this skill into my life, I have seen a significant improvement in my personal development, mentally, emotionally, and physically."

The bench press was something that I was lacking in for quite some time, all my other lifts were linearly improving, however my bench had plateaued over the past couple months. I knew I had the mental fortitude for it, so I got straight towards charting out a well-thought out regimen with checkpoint like goals that I needed to hit, to maintain a linear progress. I increased the frequency of the times I would bench in a week, and I also tediously worked on perfecting my form. This combined with the weekly PR goals I had each week truly helped me see tangible progress in an optimized manner. I think creating a precise plan is crucial in any form of improvement."

I quickly joined the DJs of AggieLand where they would have EDM nights every thursday.\nInitially, I thought my background in guitar would make DJing trivial, however as I assisted DJs on these EDM nights, I realized how much work I needed to do. From this, I took initiative by studying sets, learning from online courses, and collaborating with DJ friends.\nWith this effort, I made rapid improvements and started performing live. Over the summer in Seattle, I would play at small gatherings and events any chance I got. In summary, this experience taught me how passion can fuel hard work, leading people to learn from others, self study, and to be patient.",

I quickly realized some of the processes were counterproductive and took note of ways they could be improved. In the past, the orders were processed and shipped by the same person, one at a time. This meant that the person was constantly moving from the computer to the other workstations. I suggested to my boss that it would be much more efficient if one person worked on the computer to scan products while the other packaged them. This change optimized the efficiency of the fulfillment department."

The programs the SEC puts on can help make this stress a little less impactful. I distinctly remember one day from my freshman year when I had three homework assignments all due on the same night in addition to two separate events I had to attend, and I was completely overwhelmed. While frantically running around Zach, an SEC member asked me if I wanted a donut and some coffee that they were handing out for E-Week, and that one interaction calmed me down in the moment and made my day a little better.

My sophomore year, I made it my mission to bridge this gap and create a closer relationship between the freshmen and staff. To implement this change, I created a lunch buddies system so that every week freshmen could meet a new staff member and two other new freshmen. Additionally, I created a spreadsheet for my committee where my partners and I set aside times for one-on-ones and let our freshmen sign up for slots that worked with their schedules to get to know us better.

Meeting so many people through recruitment and pitching the idea and culture of my FLO has shaped my ability to clearly get points across and connect with others. I\u2019ve learned to listen for suggestions and concerns and communicate those thoughts to improve the experience of others.",
            "Question 11": "One day I sat in my dorm debating on eating at the dining hall that day. I checked the menu online, but had no idea if the food tasted good. I\u2019d been seeking a way to put my skills towards solving a real-world problem, so I sought out to build software to improve the Aggie dining experience and create an online review platform for the dining hall food.\nI sought out a like-minded partner and began learning the coding skills needed for this project. We pushed ourselves to hold meetings and collaborate frequently to end up with a functioning website that acted as a one-stop review platform for students to know whether the dining hall food was edible or if they should just go to Chick-Fil-A. I utilized my skills to implement a solution that improves the experience of Aggies by allowing them to voice their opinions on food."

College students should have the opportunity to learn how to speak professionally, how a business works, how to prepare for a job interview, and what a great resume looks like. To prepare college students with the skill set and determination to achieve their career goals. Recently this past summer I had an internship at an Energy Company working in the IT department. I had no familiarity with a professional job before, so this was all new. Preparing for my first interview, with my unqualified resume, in my one business suit I own, was extremely nerve racking. However, I was fortunate to have a mentor/my boss to guide me through this process. Therefore, I think every student should gain advice, tips, and have access to preparing for their professional advancement of their future careers.",

That is exactly what I did as the assistant manager, where I gained many skills I never expected to obtain. Asking detailed questions for help or guidance to your boss is important where there are no such things as stupid questions. Packages were being shipped to donors worldwide, therefore I translated emails and researched the process for different postal regions. I was fortunate to be successfully certified in Microsoft Excel, which made maintaining the organized database easier. As well as emailing donors back with website or mailing issues, and obtaining customer service skills. Researching how to solve problems on my own and learning to reach out for help if needed was how I approached these important skills to be successful.",

I gave pep talks, gave advice to anyone who had never played before, and formulated a team on who plays what position without knowing everyone\u2019s experience. Each game I was prepared with a lineup, batting order, and made sure we had enough players to play each Sunday night. I even checked that each player had the correct equipment each game and where to borrow from, as well as what rules we needed to follow. I walked into a problem and found a solution, quitting was not an option, someone just had to step up and take charge to make sure our team was successful."

Representation is extremely important when it comes to the diverse community that is within the College of Engineering. Having a representative voice present means the most to me because I know what it\u2019s like to not have your own voice heard. As someone who was previously part of an org where members' opinions were actively ignored, I can confidently say that when someone feels like their opinion doesn\u2019t matter, they feel less obligated to be involved. Without a representative voice, decisions may not best represent the body. With a representative voice in place, a sense of community is fostered, and diversity can also be represented.",
            "Question 10": "During the first semester of freshman year, I tried getting involved in a lot of organizations, wanting to meet people and explore interests I had outside of academics. I quickly learned that saying yes to every opportunity was a fast track to burnout and poor time management skills. After procrastinating an application for an organization and submitting something I didn\u2019t feel I put my 100% into, I had to reprioritize. It was unrealistic for me to join all of the orgs I\u2019d wanted while managing my academics. I wanted to prioritize quality work over quantity, doing this by limiting myself to two organizations that I could confidently give my all, while balancing other aspects of my life to the best of my ability. While it was difficult to say no to what I was passionate about, I had to remind myself that maintaining a balance was the key to success.",
            "Question 11": "At a local grocery store by home, there was an ongoing issue with a doorstep and a high ledge that caused people to trip while entering. Over the last 5 years, this ledge has remained the same. Regulars either got used to it, or accepted the minor inconvenience of stumbling while entering. One day, my friend and I decided to take matters into our own hands after I spilled a drink after tripping over the ledge. We decided to cover this ledge with the most obnoxiously neon colored duct tape we could find. Although this seems unconventional, it was effective; the ledge was fixed a week within our taping. This experience taught me how there are many inconveniences that people have just accepted in their everyday lives, and that sometimes, all it takes to bring about change is to bring awareness to a problem in a creative and noticeable way."

However, sheet music is not accessible for people who are blind or have other visual impairments.\nIn order to improve this experience, my team worked on VISM (Virtually Impaired Sheet Music) during HowdyHack 2021. The primary goal was to create a seamless way for composers to convert pdf sheet music into braille sheet music. The most difficult part of building VISM was having to learn how to read braille music notes during a 24 hour hackathon! In the end, VISM won 2nd place at the event. Our team has continued to work on the project even past the hackathon in an effort to expand the braille sheet music catalog."

However, days before the Career Fair when I was forced to think about A) how should my resume look B) how should I present myself to recruiters, I began looking for the resources available\u2026 and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the various workshops explained the process, but they made me excited. They made me ambitious. I wanted to have a stellar resume and catchy elevator pitch. I wanted to be the best candidate for work. That\u2019s why this pillar resonates with me so much.

            "Question 10": "I realized I needed additional skills while dancing with my dance partner last semester. He had joined the club later than me but progressed at a very quick pace. Very soon, our practices became frustrating due to the increasing difference in level. I felt that I was burdensome, and I wanted to change that; furthermore, I myself was dissatisfied that I stagnated on one level. Consequently, I began doing small dance exercises every morning to build muscle memory. I also began learning more about the technique behind the figures. Over the summer, I went to my local dance studio to keep in shape as well as have some of their coaches fix my basics. As of now, I have a much clearer understanding of the figures \u2013 along with an improved dance frame \u2013 so that I do not have to rely on my dance partner for their execution.",
            "Question 11": "One avenue for improvement appeared this semester. At the end of freshman year, I did not have a rigid routine: I tried not to stay late, but if it happened, this happened. This semester, however, due to my tutor job and dance meetings, I found myself staying late to finish schoolwork. The first weeks were disastrous: I didn't retain anything I studied because I was so worn out after the day, and all my work was rather low effort. To improve my productivity and to reduce the sense of being overwhelmed, I decided to shift my schedule to early rise - early bedtime. It\u2019s my second week testing out this strategy, and so far, it has been yielding pretty stable results. I can complete my studies efficiently and be able to spend my afternoons on activities that do not require intensive brain energy such as dance practices and chores."

The first time I worked at my dad's place during the high season, I felt so lost while having the pressure to increase turnover. We were always short-staffed so my dad had me taking orders at the register, packaging to-go orders, seasoning crawfish, and running to the kitchen to boil even more crawfish. I realized that I needed to work on my communication and interpersonal skills in order to be able to provide a better experience for customers. My way of improving these skills was to watch and learn from my dad. He's worked there for so long that he even picked up on Spanish!

Most recently, I taught at Cypress Creek High School where I was given complete control of the Drumline. The kids far exceeded my expectations in terms of their talent and attitude. However, their rehearsal etiquette left much to be desired. It was in no fault of their own and mainly boiled down to the lack of luster attention to detail from the head directors. To combat this, I dedicated much of our time to going over proper rehearsal procedures such as attending to the proper set position, staying at attention until told to relax, and advocating for student leadership. I learned about the importance of having an efficient rehearsal procedure from my old percussion director/mentor and identified Cypress Creek's need for it which ultimately improved my skills as an educator."

When me and my friends started, none of us had any experience either making music or video editing, so I took the responsibility of learning how to video edit for the project. Mind you, this was in the middle of the AP testing cycle, so realistically I shouldn't be giving that much time to a fun project.

The team was very large, but for the most part the upperclassmen and the underclassmen were two very distinct groups with not a lot of overlap. The only underclassmen that received any sort of mentorship were the exceptionally fast ones, and even then it was more friendly advice than mentorship. I disliked the lack of mentorship throughout my underclassmen experience, so by the time I was a senior I sat down and had a meeting with our coach about implementing a mentorship program, where an upperclassmen takes two to three underclassmen and gives them advice with running, training, but also school work, productive habits, and other topics. Although, especially towards the end of the year lots of the groups stopped meeting, I have kept up with my two freshmen to this day helping them with whatever they need."

However, what she often neglects to remember is that she was in school 40 years ago and times have changed. Not to say that her experiences are not valuable but they are vastly different than mine. Thus the pillar that resonates with me the most is that dealing with being a representative voice. The experiences of all students and members of administration are different and to truly work towards success for both parties, there needs to be communication and understanding. Additionally, as the engineering student body demographically diversifies for the better, the needs and concerns of the college are going to diversify as well.

Thus, for the next event, I implemented the solution of creating a Google Calendar. While somewhat simple, this calendar helped show the entire duration of a project. We were better able to plan out time to implement alternative plans in case something similar occurred. Additionally, this calendar put everyone on the same page and allowed people to see how action items fit in with their own schedules. We improved organization and communication which in turn translated to much greater success in our next project."

At the time, we had weekly meetings with our project manager to discuss how to improve our parts. In addition to these meetings, I proposed we have weekly meetings with all the groups to discuss the integration and compatibility of implementing all the parts in sync. I stated that while our meetings with him were very useful, we weren\u2019t able to account for integration without the other groups.

            "Question 11": "As a freshman, I was a member of the flo FEAST and was in the service committee. As a member, other freshmen in my committee and I didn\u2019t get to give much input on service projects planned by our co-chairs. As a sophomore, I had the opportunity to be a co-chair myself in the same service committee, and my partner and I emphasized freshman participation as a key goal of ours for the year. We implemented a meeting structure for our committee outside of the regular meetings for FEAST, which encouraged our freshmen to feel closer to each other and us as co-chairs. These meetings generally consisted of eating dinner and tackling our weekly tasks, and whenever there was a big event like a donation drive or service retreat to be organized, all of our freshmen had a chance to brainstorm and help make decisions."

It ensures inclusivity in fairs, events, and programs, fairness and opportunity for every single engineer regardless of their career path, problem-solving by including different perspectives to find solutions as a group, and most importantly it promotes innovation and creativity. Having availability in programs and career fairs spreads awareness for others to pursue their goals. Additionally, it allows engineers to have an influence on the school, companies, and colleagues because of their professionalism and voice. Individually, it allows me to put myself out in the real world and to have my ideas and skills shared.",
            "Question 10": "A time when I realized I needed additional skills to be successful was when I was indulging in a research paper in AI and supercapacitors. My first approach was identifying skill gaps. Based on the data, I had to make a recurrent neural network model (RNN) and LSTM which I was unfamiliar with. Next, I had to set a specific goal to learn as much as possible by the end of the week. To do so, I had to have dedicated learning which meant eliminating distractions and allocating a significant time to learning through projects, videos, courses, and programming. As I delved deeper into the subject, I gained passion and interest in it leading to setting new goals to improve the paper. This is the best approach to be successful and acquire numerous useful skills in a small amount of time.",
            "Question 11": "A time I saw an avenue for improvement was when I worked at Code Ninjas at an instructor. The students were different ages, and all learned differently which forced me to find diverse learning styles to teach the learners to understand the problems better. Some weren't able to comprehend problems from listening, so I would try to visually communicate problems. I would write lines of code and drawings of the situations that would guide them to the path of a solution on their own. Those who couldn't visualize or understood problems from speaking, would find solutions from hands on methods. If there were mathematical problems, I would show them couple of dices and construct hands on problems for the kids to work out and solve or I would guide them to certain puzzles so the students could observe errors in programming projects themselves."

I want to be involved in something that gives back to the community and makes sure that their voices are heard. Engineering students are some of the most hardworking people I have ever met, and it is important that their efforts and voices are heard loud and clear. I believe that the best fit for me would be something like the Systems Administration or Marketing committees. Both of these allow for the opportunity to branch out and work with technology in ways that I haven\u2019t experienced yet. There is just so much that you can do with technology now, and the possibilities are endless for ways to market and ensure that all engineers are having a positive experience at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 10": "After returning from summer break last year, I began to look for internships. I realized that I lacked some of the qualifications for computer science internships that I was interested in. I decided to dedicate myself to learning as much as I could the next few months about the subject, and I set my goal on getting an internship that year. I took the route of spending about an hour making sure that I was at least one percent more knowledgeable than I was the day before. If there was an event on campus or an opportunity to learn more, I made sure to take it. I believe that my dedication last year to ensuring that I knew more than I did the day before is why I ended up with my internship at the end of the year.",
            "Question 11": "During my internship with H-E-B, I was excited because it would allow me to improve both my technical skills and my professional skills. I haven\u2019t had much professional experience, so this was something I was focused on refining. Even though my internship was hybrid, I decided to stay in San Antonio for more exposure. Doing this allowed me to connect and network with a lot more people in the company than I would have staying home. I also encouraged myself to lead team discussions in daily meetings. After only a couple of weeks I had improved my confidence in a professional setting drastically. Looking back, I am glad that I decided to push myself and stay in a situation where I was forced to grow and develop my professional experience."

            "Question 10": "When I was in high school, I along with some of my friends created an organization called RunCorpusChristi which aided nonprofits such as the Driscoll Children's Hospital and the Ronald McDonald House during COVID. Within this group I was tasked with being the social media marketing manager. I had no idea how to manage multiple social media, however I was willing to learn. I would go to other organizations to visualize what our social media posts should look like and I watched videos on how to create enticing and vibrant social media posts to get the attention of more people so they could help our cause.

            "Question 11": "Throughout my freshman year at Texas A&M I struggled with anxiety issues that had persisted on for years of my life. These issues heightened because I was thrust into a completely new environment and it affected my ability to make new friends, do things that I love to do, and learn. I realized that coming into my second year at Texas A&M that had to change and I needed to improve myself. I decided that over the summer I had to take a step back and a break from everything that caused my anxiety so I could identify the root problem. Through implementing various aides such as meditation, deep breathing, and going for walks I was able to at least control my issues. Starting this year at A&M I have been able to see the improvements but there is still a lot of growth that needs to be accomplished."

Growing up, my dad introduced me to the engineering field through the projects he brought home. With this exposure, I\u2019ve always wanted to be an engineer. Not everyone has an engineer for a parent, resulting in less exposure to the field. This is why\nproviding the opportunity where others can learn about engineering, interact with professionals, and engage in activities can be important.

            "Question 10": "After starting my first Hackathon project with other first timers, it was quickly evident that we lacked the skill to finish our project idea in a 24 hour timeframe. Recognizing this, we changed our approach. I proposed a simpler idea so we can focus on enhancing teamwork, coding skills, and getting familiar with the program we were using. After hours of working, progress was still minimal. As the deadline was approaching, we decided to ask a mentor for help. We absorbed their feedback and techniques on the project. Additionally, I was able to learn new skills and improve my technical skills. This taught me the importance of valuing continuous skill development. Although my group wasn\u2019t able to win anything, it was a learning opportunity and motivated me to seek new skills.",

I was starting homework late, getting sleepless nights, and struggling to balance my responsibilities effectively. I was falling asleep in class, performing worse, and struggling with my well-being. I addressed this by identifying the issue: excessive phone usage. My first step was limiting screen time on apps that weren\u2019t necessary. After some success with that approach, there was still plenty of room for improvement. I tried different techniques, I identified what worked best for me and incorporated those strategies into my daily routine. I set clear priorities for each day and dedicated time for focused work and leisurely time. I learned how to say no to non-essential time commitments. Throughout consistency with this strategy, I saw significant improvement in myself. I was more productive, able to meet deadlines, and felt better about myself."

Not too long ago, I had little knowledge about the data field, despite being interested in it. I attended several panels about data engineering and its future, as well as workshops related to the field (excel, C++, python). Learning about the complexities of machine learning and AI, combined with the impact it has on our future, further ignited my passion for the subject. I exposed myself to more hands-on learning environments. For example, I am active in the Aggie Data Science Club and I research topics I find interesting in my free time.

I had never dealt with a failure like this especially with school, and it hit me hard. In this instance, I saw an avenue for improvement in myself, both in my habits and overall mindset. I decided to take these classes in the summer and became passionate about improving myself. I set aside study time, made an organized calendar, and focused on minimizing unhealthy distractions. Not only did I end up getting A\u2019s in both of the classes, I also pulled myself out of a hole and came out happier and more productive than I've ever been."

I took it upon myself to suggest a solution to the managers, which involved moving the station closer to the bar, which let both bar staff and waiters use it efficiently. Despite being a fairly simple change, many members of the waitstaff and kitchen noticed a decrease in congestion, and an easier time getting beverage orders."

Because of this, the aspect of being a representative voice for the often unheard must be a core value of any organization that I take part in. Life experiences in roles of leadership such as a soccer captain have taught me that a diversity of opinions is the most efficient way to bring success and equity to a group of people. This came up frequently when I had to convey the discourse of the team over tactical and formation problems to our coach. As a result, I have seen how only through conflict and contrasting opinions will the best solution arise. In SEC, I can put this principle of representative voice into practice by using the large platform of the organization to make sure that no engineer goes overlooked.",
            "Question 10": "I originally applied to A&M as a mechanical engineer. During my first year here, however, I discovered my passion for game development, and I decided to apply for ETAM as a computer science major. Due to the competitive nature of computer science, I knew that it was going to be a struggle to catch up to other more experienced students. That\u2019s why I joined Texas A&M Gave Developers, a club focused on creating video games and learning from industry professionals. After that, I spent the summer using my free time to learn a game engine, Unity. This was so that I could participate in TAGD\u2019s game jam, a semester-long game development competition among students. Now with my new skills, I have joined a team of 5 and begun the journey of creating a rogue-like game so that I can chase my dream of being a developer.",
            "Question 11": "I used to not have control of my life. Everything that I did was done in order to appease my family and live up to expectations that they set for me. This lifestyle led to a spiraling of anxiety which made my life overwhelming. After spending some time looking inward, I was able to come to the conclusion that I needed to spend some time on self-improvement. By being more self-serving and taking care of my mental health through revitalizing my faith in God with prayer, I was able to get closer to my ideal, free self. I have continued to look for ways to improve as a person, learning the importance of living in the moment and relying on those who care about you. I now recognize my own flaws and try to live without regrets, leaning on both God and my friends when I begin to feel suffocated."

Engineering is a challenging field, often causing students to focus only on immediate concerns like exams and assignments. The SEC's role in emphasizing and promoting the importance of professional development for engineering students is invaluable. Many students are so engrossed in meeting basic requirements that they overlook essential future planning and activities that can prepare them for the professional world. I want to contribute to the SEC's mission by advocating for the importance of professional development, helping fellow engineering students reach their full potential, and guiding them through the complexities of an engineering career.",
            "Question 10": "The past year, my freshman year, transition from high school to college was very difficult for me, academically. Meeting people who were so knowledgeable in the courses that I was struggling so much in helped me realize that I needed additional skills and knowledge to be successful. I took this whole process step by step, starting with meeting more people who were good at the things I was bad at, to see their approach and their idea of studying for those particular classes. Next, I changed my way of studying and organized my work day by day in order to reduce stress and create a routine. I slowly built my way up to where my peers were and I understood the importance of organizing my work and living a balanced life. My approach was to learn what I was doing wrong and then take the necessary actions to fix everything.",
            "Question 11": "Over the summer, I took Physics 207 and a few other courses to keep me busy and promised myself that I would understand everything and try my best to work harder, especially as physics was a weak subject for me. I studied every day continuously, which resulted in no time for my family, friends, or me. After two weeks or so I realized how inefficient this method was because I was still doing poorly in my class. I changed up my routine so I have time for everything, started spending time with my family while balancing my studies as well. This resulted in me doing way better than I was and understanding the class, while I had time to do other fun things. Once again I took a step-by-step approach to the avenue for improvement and implemented an effective solution."

Representation has always meant so much to me, and being a female in Engineering, there have been many times when I have felt underrepresented and overshadowed by my peers. This statement means so much to me because it is so heartwarming to know that there are students who strive to represent everyone in Engineering. It is no easy task to represent so many students, and it makes me so happy to see that there are students who care so much about making sure that every Engineering student's voice is heard. I hope I will be able to do the same for other students, to not only make sure everyone around me can feel represented, but also represented accurately.",
            "Question 10": "Growing up, I have always been extremely shy and introverted. I was this way my entire life, but when I started college, I realized that my social anxiety was keeping me away from meeting people and making lifelong friends. I wanted to become more social, but I had no idea how to be social. During my second semester of Sophomore year, I shocked everyone, my friends and family by rushing a sorority. I realized I needed to learn how to be social so I did something completely out of my comfort zone. Once I forced myself outside of that safe, closed off box of mine, I realized that I had opened up so many doors of opportunity. A year ago, I would break down if you told me I had and interview the next day, but now, i feel like I can go into an interview and be just fine.",
            "Question 11": "I started my Engineering journey at the Texas A&M Galveston Campus, and during my time at the Galveston Campus I was very involved with their chapter of Engineering Without Borders. I was first officer, then became vice president of the organization, and during my time of leadership we saw that the Galveston Bay needed to be cleaned up, and that we needed to encourage people to keep our beaches clean. In an effort to clean up the Bay, we launched our Island project, where we would use the litter we found on the Galveston bay to create a fully functional dock. This project not only brought awareness to keeping our oceans safe for marine life, but was also encouragement to the students of that campus to recycle as much plastic waste as they can."

Engineering is difficult to understand because, on top of the countless career paths, it is also a mindset that can be applied to any problem. This difficult-to-understand profession is the reason why increasing engineering awareness through the SEC\u2019s programs and events is the pillar that means the most to me. I entered college as an engineering major unsure of what my passions were. My interest in engineering only developed after attending SEC events like Industry Night and Career Fair. Talking to people in the industry helped reveal how applicable an engineering mindset is, and SEC helped push me to pursue more significant goals by exposing me to the opportunities of engineering. Therefore, it has become a goal of mine to help spread engineering awareness like SEC has already done for me.",

There\u2019s something about mindlessly chucking a heavy object and knocking things over that resonates with me. Recently, my roommates have also taken on the hobby. As much as I love the new company, there\u2019s one problem. My spot as the best bowler is under attack! While my score has plateaued, my roommates seem to keep improving. Due to my competitive nature, I have begun searching for additional tips to master this sport. I started by enrolling myself in our school\u2019s bowling class. While this may seem over the top, I now get to bowl while telling myself it\u2019s studying. From textbooks and YouTube videos, my view of bowling has changed from a mindless activity to learning how to apply new knowledge. From a larger perspective, I am developing my ability to turn theory into practice.",
            "Question 11": "Last summer, I had the opportunity to participate in the SEC Directed Internship. My team of computer science majors was tasked with mapping out the workspace of several robotic arms that would be used on a spaceport. Despite the initial thrill of working at the forefront of space development, doubt filled our minds as we realized we had no prior knowledge of robotics or kinematics. Our initial solution required us to learn how to manually calculate the workspace of each robotic arm. This solution would not be beneficial for our company or tailor to our skill sets, so we sought to improve our approach. I consulted friends in other engineering departments, broke our task into smaller deliverables, and researched ways we could approach solving this problem. Ultimately, I suggested an improved solution that would allow us to focus on writing code to map out workspaces while developing as programmers."

Awareness/representation; I think, ultimately, is something that will always be crucial for development, and external/internal divisions. As a woman of color within the STEM industry, I relate to this motive, eager to be a part of this growth and desperate to take the next steps. I am all about holding a voice and learning about other groups and divisions, so seeing that this is one of the pillars pushed me to want to be a part of the organization even more. I feel that everyone has a voice and deserves to be heard; this is a perfect platform for that - a community of different people with the similar interests/values, all with the want of seeing a difference/being a part of that change.",
            "Question 10": "I wasn\u2019t the outgoing, popular girl. I grew up in a place with very little representation/diversity, shy and in my bubble. High school, I saw so many opportunities, concluding underrepresentation/lack of diversity didn\u2019t have to be my weakness, but rather a strength to reach my audience. So much pushed me into becoming the person I am today but, I realized that holding yourself in your shell will never let you know your full potential/could limit you from endless possibilities. Leadership is a skill everyone needs to learn, regardless of what their pathway is. After pushing myself, I truly was able to realize how strong of a skill that is to have. Taking initiative, managing people, organization, public speaking - it takes time to learn and may not come naturally to all. It helps us in the workplace and helps us learn more about people, life skills, and society.",
            "Question 11": "Previously, I talked about leadership opportunities that I had become a part of in high school, however with the concept of leadership, comes responsibility, and often because of the huge jump in environment, time management became an issue. high school, for a lot of us, was a time of stress and overload, so being on top of everything became difficult at times for sure, however, if things are not up to date and you are falling behind, I think it\u2019s fairly easy to catch on. Taking matters into my own hands, I found that communication and teamwork is the key. of course, when you hold a leadership role, you work with a group of individuals who also hold similar responsibilities, so communicating the issue, working on it together, and ultimately just organizing and planning ahead of time became my best friend."

Engineers Week is a notable event for engineers at this school because it allows us to have a distraction from the stress and work that we deal with every day. It is important to have reminders that there is more to life than work, which is also why the SEC\u2019s Envision is very important to me. The benefits that come from having an engineering degree can change lives, which is why it is vital to inspire the next generation of engineers.

This, specifically, speaks to me because I believe that the vast majority does not appreciate just how much engineering is involved in everyday life. The only way to educate society on the importance of engineering is through different, dynamic events that allow the general public an opportunity to expose themselves to engineering. Along with this, I enjoy educating others on things that I am passionate about and involved in, so I am excited for this opportunity. I want to not only raise awareness to engineering, but also to the SEC and everything that it stands for. Engineering awareness impacted my life when I spent two summers working in construction building data centers and hospitals. Engineers do an incredible amount of work and I got to witness that first hand while working in construction.",

While managing various job sites, I noticed that there was room for more streamlined communication and coordination between the design team, building owners, and the trades. To address this issue, I implemented a system of regular meetings and progress updates to ensure everyone was on the same page. This helped to resolve any misunderstandings and keep operations running smoothly. By taking this initiative, I not only enhanced the efficiency of the construction process, but refined my business skills through effective communication and leadership. This experience taught me the importance of identifying and implementing solutions to drive success in real world situations.

It was not until late high school when my friend asked me to help them get an initial design of the robot, which had to solve multiple problems given many parameters. Through the process, I enjoyed it and realized I wanted to be an engineer. I would love to show kids who have no idea there are other professions than a doctor, astronauts, and YouTubers a glimpse of engineering and how it can be incredibly fun at times.

It was difficult because I had not developed the style of leadership that worked, so I chose to copy the style of others. I was having to deal with many internal issues so early into the year, unfortunately with no idea why. I approached my dad seeking advice as in his job he leads hundreds of people. The first question he asked me was to describe how I lead and how I would want to be led. As simple as it sounds, that was all it really took. Developing a style of leadership for big groups of people came slowly, but by seeking advice and developing a solution, I was able to construct a foundation for my leadership style, and skills.",

Often, I would ask my saxophone lesson teacher if he had any complaints, to which he always responded with a quip about him bringing his desk to the practice room \"one of these days\". Having a fun, challenging project in front of me, I decided to make the solution my Eagle Scout project. Instead of just building a few boring desks with only one practical application, I worked with both a master carpenter, and an Aggie engineer to design desks that served as a music stand for whenever it was nearly impossible to find one, a storage compartment for the lesson teachers' equipment, and an adjustable workstation."

I first decided to ask my coworkers if this was a shared experience and take stock of the various issues with the checklists. Upon hearing the same resounding message, I decided to come up with my own simplified checklist that streamlined the opening and closing process by following a single path around the facility, which prevented us from wasting time. My manager was very interested in the new checklist, as he wasn't even aware of problems in the old one. He reviewed my checklist and ultimately decided to implement it."

I wish I participated in an event like the Envision Conference in high school. I entered engineering for being \u201cgood at math\u201d and for the lucrative career potential, as I\u2019m sure many highschoolers do every year. I never knew the fun in designing intersections, until I started doing so in a video game last year. In fact, I didn\u2019t even know Civil Engineering as an engineering discipline. Everyone knows what doctors and mechanics do, but not so much engineers, who work behind the scenes. Engineering awareness really resonates with me because I believe students should know about what engineers do, and have the opportunity to explore different engineering disciplines.",
            "Question 10": "I arrived in the US in 10th grade from Taiwan, where being a student was all about test grades. I realized I need to know how to present myself, how to talk, to be successful in the US. My English skill and isolation from COVID didn\u2019t help. First, I flipped through all the online forums. I learned to connect with people, ask questions about them. I then read a book, which essentially taught me to fake myself. I would grade myself in social interactions. Did I come off too strong and said too much, or I wasn\u2019t authentic enough and seemed boring? My other approach is \u201clearn as you do\u201d. I joined clubs, went to most social events. All of these, they worked. I still have a long way to go in learning to present myself, and this skill is more important than ever in the professional world.",
            "Question 11": "I\u2019m a student technician at the security operations team of Texas A&M. We have training sessions where a high level manager would present classes on cybersecurity. The problem is, he often cancels these classes or isn\u2019t prepared for them due to his busy schedules. Eventually, the attendance of these classes dwindled. I proposed for the students to present the classes instead. My coworkers agreed and the higher ups liked the idea as well. We would take turns to make presentations on various topics in a certification exam, a $400 exam all team members can take for free. The exam vouchers go to waste if they\u2019re claimed/activated but not used within a year, which was a problem in previous years. I\u2019m hoping the change would encourage and help everyone study for the exam, which has to be taken before March 2024."

Nervous, unprepared, and unresearched. As I approached a recruiter, my palms grew sweaty, and my throat parched; I choked when they asked me to talk about myself. As I walked out, I realized how important it is for a student to be professionally adept, and this experience was followed by countless hours of reading self-help articles and advice videos that prepared me for numerous career fairs that followed and seize every opportunity to make a memorable impression. Advice from recruiters has served me more tangibly than any academic course I've taken, leading me to build and retain strong connections, showing the invaluable perks professional advancement has early in one's college career.",
            "Question 10": "During an internship this summer, my team was assigned a problem statement and was tasked to prepare a full-fledged business proposal for our solution. We didn't have the knowledge nor the expertise to jump into developing an all-encompassing solution. The need to gain new skills pushed me to think of ways to complete the task efficiently. My first step was to acknowledge what I didn't know and discard any half-knowledge I had about a topic. The next step was to open-mindedly and willingly learn from people who were experts in that area and ask questions to increase the depth of my understanding. The following step was implementing what I learned into the project and continually improving what I had initially accomplished. The final step was to objectively analyze my performance and act on any criticism I received\u2014this cycle of learning and improving sharpened my ability to complete demanding tasks.",
            "Question 11": "Sticky notes, a whiteboard with illegible scribbles, the notes app on my phone, and a calendar open on my laptop. This was the way I organized my agenda for each day. It didn't matter if it was homework or a dentist appointment; everything I needed to do was unmanageably scattered. It was an ironic time in my life, considering I valued efficiency more than anything else. I realized that dealing with the clutter would significantly improve my routine. I loaded an integrated calendar onto all my devices and worked out a way to sync them. I categorized all my events and tasks and organized them by priority, date and time, and expected deliverables. It was a tiny change, but that level of efficiency had not only improved my reliability in group settings, but had also allowed me to pursue larger responsibilities where I had created the freedom to adapt."

            "Question 10": "In 2020, I was selected to debate a bill in the Texas Senate, this experience greatly enhanced my public speaking skills, although not without some struggle. The largest crowd I had spoken to was just 30 people, and now I had to not only present but also defend my political beliefs in front of hundreds of people. To address this gap in skill, I went to the best speakers I knew for advice, my teachers; and channeled their wisdom into my speech. The key knowledge to the success of my speech was to treat it as more of a conversation than an argument to ease my nerves and improve my persuasiveness. My effort paid off when I was recognized by my city council in a Proclamation of Honor ceremony.",
            "Question 11": "While working at the Texas Department of Transportation as an intern, I noticed that data entry errors were the primary cause of delay for my team's highway design reports. Over the years these delays had snowballed into a 6 month backlog of design requests, with a $4 million consulting contract being negotiated to remedy it. So I approached my manager with a proposal that I shift my focus from design work to improving our design process by eliminating the source of these errors through automation. I solicited and implemented my coworkers feedback throughout the software rebuild. After release, our average project completion time decreased from 15 days to 10, causing the backlog to be cleared in 1 month; and saving taxpayers $4 million from the canceled contract."

I've had the great fortune to be mentored by others throughout high school and college, and it's always been great being able to look up to them for advice on how to conduct myself and what I should be doing. I wouldn't have gotten into engineering if it weren't for my robotics teacher, Dr. Dwivedi. I wouldn't have decided to pursue a master's degree if it weren't for my professor, Dr. Leyk.

            "Question 10": "My first semester at A&M, I took Data Structures and Algorithms concurrently with Introduction to C++. It was incredibly challenging to be implementing data structures while also trying to learn the language of C++. I ended up spending a lot of time in office hours learning from teaching assistants, and it was honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made. Tools such as Google and Stack Overflow are very helpful, but being able to learn from someone else, ask questions, and get meaningful answers really pushed my learning to the next level. It showed me what an impact people could have, and interested me in the idea of working with and helping teach others. As it so happened, I did quite well in the class, and in my second semester I became a TA - now I'm able to help teach and mentor others!",
            "Question 11": "Ever since high school, I've been a part of Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat and it's helped me tremendously by always pushing me forward to higher spiritual goal while not getting bogged down by material affairs. However, at A&M, there's no branch, and I always see myself losing my drive after a while. Over summer, I decided to see what I could do about this. I reached out to many of my contacts in Dallas, Austin, and Houston to see if there were any devotees that were coming to A&M that might be interested in joining the community. As it happened, I met 8 individuals who were already on the path of spirituality and were interested in participating. Over this semester, I've started holding weekly satsung (religious meetings) at my apartment to connect us together. It's been a lot of work, but it's been amazing for me and hopefully for others too."

Being a senior in Industrial and Systems Engineering, I know and understand the difficulties of navigating an engineering degree. Having a representative voice such as the SEC is crucial to improving the quality of life of engineering students and ensuring that our grievances are heard. Having not received my first choice major, I was immediately distraught and believed that there was no way forward for me. Utilizing the resources available to me and a mentor given to me through IISE I was able to find a path within my degree where I was content. Being able to give engineering students representation can positively impact their quality of life and help address the unique challenges that we encounter as Aggies and as Engineers.",
            "Question 10": "Over this past summer, I worked as an industrial engineering intern. As an intern, I was given the task of implementing a new factory-wide continuous improvement process that moved away from the previous paper and pencil process. However, I was unfamiliar with the program that they wanted me to use, which was Microsoft PowerAutomate. I immediately got to work using the initial building blocks that were worked on for this process. I learned using YouTube, Linkedin Learning, and Microsoft\u2019s instructional videos, to understand how the program worked and how to properly construct a process flow. I quickly learned the program and continuously adapted the program whenever there was a limitation. Through trial and error, and asking for help when needed, I became proficient at using Microsoft Power Automate. Following the implementation of the process, I was brought on by the IT Head to develop another process flow with global applications.",

However, we encountered an obvious obstacle in putting together the event: COVID-19. How were we going to put on an event meant to unite the freshman class, if a majority of the freshman class is not present on campus? After brainstorming ideas, I came up with an idea, to create an online discord server and have organizations host online games such as Among Us on the discord server. In addition to this, I created an instructional how-to video over Zoom on how to create a discord channel for the organizations participating just in case they were unfamiliar with the app."

By providing professional advancement through SEC, engineering students can get the experience boost they need to get a headstart in the professional world, get a better look at what their future may look like, and also provide invaluable connections making finding a job right out of college much easier. I'm personally quite nervous about doing enough to ensure I'm prepared, so I think SEC and this pillar in particular will get me to where I need to be.",
            "Question 10": "When I first came to A&M I thought that I would be an Aerospace major, but when I took my first coding class freshman year I realized that I enjoyed coding more and from there changed my decision for my major. This came with its own issues, however, as while I had just started learning Python most students around me already knew multiple languages or had done multiple projects. I only felt more out of my depth when I joined Aggie Coding Club as I could hardly even participate in the project I joined due to lack of knowledge. I knew I needed more skills to continue computer programming, so since then I've learned Java, learned C++ from CSCE 120, and also begun my own projects using OpenCV, AI, and Unity. At this point, I feel far more prepared and ready to participate at the same level as other students.",

This came down mostly to some of our younger members who were struggling to keep up with the rest of the front ensemble. I saw this as an opportunity, and I began to give small amounts of help to our two members who needed the most help at the end of lunch and at the end of the day. Eventually, paired with the help of our percussion director, these two members were able to get caught up and our front ensemble carried on."

Personally, I did not decide that engineering was something I wanted to pursue until around the time I was applying to college, which is pretty late. As a result I have felt behind compared to my peers in some aspects, especially technical ones as I was never exposed to coding or CAD. I believe if I was exposed to the topics in engineering I would've been set on pursuing engineering earlier. One way that I have firsthand seen SEC\u2019s involvement in this cause is through the Envision event. Last year one Saturday morning in Zach, when I volunteered I saw many young boys and girls being exposed to the topics found within engineering, which I believe is such a valuable experience.",

We synced the mobile online ordering system with our printer to alert us of orders in real time. Additionally, we set one or two tasks for each of us so that we would cut down on time by only doing certain tasks and not having to switch and move around the kitchen. In our efforts to improve our customer service at Nekter, teamwork and innovation were our most valuable assets. These are the skills I will continue to bring to any task or job."

The first thing I did was ask my mentor for a basic understanding of the problem. He explained some basic ideas, including a unit testing package to use and how my tests should be structured. Afterwards, I was mostly on my own in writing the tests. After making some initial progress, I got stuck trying to use a package related to isolating my tests.

My group mates and I had very different approaches to solving problems, and we didn\u2019t mesh very well together. It wasn\u2019t until a few weeks later when we realized that we could use our different styles of coding as a strength. Rather than each of us coding separately and comparing end results, we collaborated on one code and talked through the problems. This proved to be far more efficient and we ended up breezing through the rest of the semester all from one simple adjustment to optimize our work. This experience has made me eager to further work in teams within SEC, developing events on a large scale through a collaborative effort."

It embodies the principle that diversity and inclusion are more than just words filling empty spaces Which are crucial for innovation and progression. As a student within the College of Engineering, It can sometimes be intimidating being surrounded by brilliant minds but having a committee to express your voice on a bigger platform and represent the student body is something which is necessary especially if the school's goal is 25,000 graduates by 2025. SEC's commitment to representative voice means that I can learn and collaborate in an environment where my unique background and experiences are valued. This emphasis on representative voice inspires me to contribute meaningfully, knowing my ideas can help shape a better future for our Aggies and beyond.",
            "Question 10": "This summer, during a 3-month virtual team project directed by SEC, I realized there were some areas where I felt my skills didn't meet the standard that I set out for myself and the team. Working remotely presented many challenges in time management. With the freedom of not having any classes, I spent a lot of my time outdoors with my friends fishing, playing basketball, or working out. I dreaded working on my team project but I knew in order for our team's success I needed to do my part. I approached this issue by waking up earlier and allocating 3-4 hours dedicated to project work. Doing such gave me time to do both my work and spend time enjoying summer. I also saw myself improve in overall morale which I believe at the time was much needed.",
            "Question 11": "Working at a golf course, I observed a concerning issue: an excessive amount of water bottles and scorecards being discarded, contributing to unnecessary waste. Realizing the environmental impact from an engineering perspective. I decided to propose a solution to implement a recycle bin at our staff meeting. During that meeting, I stressed our aligned responsibility to reduce paper and plastic being thrown away daily. We as a team then discussed new responsibilities and bin placement and even sent out notifications to members about the new implements. Seeing my idea come to life and have a positive impact truly felt rewarding. I hope to hear back one day from my job about the positive impact I was able to help spark."

To me, professional advancement is many things, such as improving your resume, narrowing down companies in your field of interest, or evolving your speaking skills professionally. I want to be able to help support my fellow Aggies in doing such things so that they are prepared and ready for the leap that is soon to come. SEC's Career Fair, DI Saturday, and Industry Nights do an excellent job of this already, and I am hoping to join and help sustain this level of advancement.",
            "Question 10": "During my time in middle school and early high school, my classes did not require me to study for very long outside of class for me to get good grades. Because of this I would play video games after school everyday and not put much time into studying. This would all change my sophomore year once I got into Algebra II. After failing the first exam I realized that I would need to put more time into understanding the homework and study if I wanted to succeed. After working on my studying habits over the year, I was able to pass the class with an A and a strong foundation in algebra.",

I would play with my friends often and would notice that my friends were a lot better than me and that I didn't have the skills that they had on the court. I realized that this was due to the fact that my friends practiced shooting and dribbling every day and that I did not take the game as seriously as they did. I wanted to be on the same level as them so I decided to put more time into improving. The next summer I went to the YMCA almost everyday and worked on my shot. When I came back to school the next fall, my friends were shocked to see the player that I became."

I think that a lot of the issues stem from the general needs of the students being overlooked as the university's 25 by 25 goal is being fulfilled.

            "Question 10": "I think that all engineers should strive for additional knowledge every day. As engineers we are responsible for knowing enough and being skilled enough to be able to prevent dangerous situations and protect the general public. With that being said one time that the need for additional knowledge and skills was very apparent was when I was on my FTC robotics team in high school. I was the head engineer, so I stayed late most nights to work with the programmers to debug and tune up the robot as needed. However, early on I realized that there was a pretty severe language gap between myself and the programmers because I knew very little about coding. To fix this, I took it upon myself to learn JavaScript and to understand the code so we could more effectively communicate with each other and solve our problems more efficiently.",
            "Question 11": "I enjoy playing the guitar, but as many who play the guitar know, cable management can become a nightmare very quickly, especially when pedals are involved. I have been playing guitar for a few years now, so my guitar pedal collection has grown quite large. Last semester I was living in a small apartment with not a lot of space, so I didn't have a lot of room to keep things sprawled out. When my pedals were all hooked up and set up, they took up a lot of room and were very messy, but if I put them away, it became harder to just pick up the guitar and play it casually, as I didn't have my effects. To resolve this problem, over the summer, I designed and built a pedalboard from scratch. This significantly improved my setup and fixed my guitar-related issues."

            "Question 10": "After moving to Texas from Dubai I realized when I first entered high school in America that my professional English language skills were greatly absent, and struggled with my professional essay assignments. I decided to approach that weakness of mine by committing to outside-the-classroom practice. By going to tutoring hours and completing additional practices from reading to comprehension. I believe the key to that commitment was pushing myself, especially in the assignments in English that I most struggled with. Which were the professional language skills and writing. As I knew early on these skills are necessary in my college years and my future professional field in engineering.

I feel that it is important to branch out and display the wonders of engineering to other people who are open to learning. Engineering awareness means bringing people together through events and other things to really show them what engineering has to offer. I believe this pillar is very important because it allows not just SEC, but the College of Engineering in general to gain new members. Overall, I resonate with this pillar the most because it aligns with my personal experiences and I want to be able to help people find their path and see a side of engineering they've never seen before.",
            "Question 10": "My first job at an Italian restaurant was the first time I realized I needed additional skills. I had this job the summer of my sophomore year of high school. At the time, I wasn't really aware of how management affects an establishment, so I was often oblivious to the errors in management. There were times when I would get asked to come in on an off day that had been planned for the last two weeks. Things like that and similar actions made me realize that I need to do something about it. I realized that I needed to stand up for myself and speak up against issues that they have within management, and I did just that. I started coming out of my shell and took control of what was fair for me as a worker. It was quite a learning experience and a hard one at that.",

The first year I was drum captain COVID happened and it was hard to do regular band activities since everyone needed to social distance. Nobody was really practicing or trying to get better, so I called the rest of the section leaders to meet and discuss a plan where we could get everyone involved. Long story short, we got my director involved, and the changes were implemented, including new ways to practice together without actually being with each other. Some of the practice techniques are actually still used today. This situation taught me how to take a problem, analyze it, and use my position to improve upon it."

Locking myself in Evans for what felt like days, I scoured the internet for physics help. I discovered the YouTube channel Flipping Physics, I worked through as many practice exams as I could, and I completed practice problems until Evans security practically kicked me out. When the test finally rolled around, I scored a 100, proving to me that staying on top of your classes is much better than cramming.",
            "Question 11": "Over winter break, I was searching for ways to make myself a more competitive applicant for internships. Searching for ways to do this, I discovered Coursera, and browsed classes that would make me more marketable. Over the break, I took classes that expanded my knowledge in Python, and I even found my passion for ML/AI. Even over the summer, I knew I had time on my hands to learn more technical skills, so even months after I first found it, I returned to Coursera to expand my knowledge as a programmer, and as a student."

This diversity allows for a more comprehensive approach to advancing the careers and skills of its members. The Development division can establish partnerships with companies and organizations, fostering mutually beneficial relationships. Companies may be interested in recruiting A&M students from SEC, while members can gain access to resources, mentorship, and internships. By being part of development I can also take on leadership roles and gain valuable leadership experience, further contributing to their professional development.",
            "Question 10": "Last summer I had an internship. I was tasked with a project with multiple teams and tight deadlines. As the project progressed, it became evident that my existing skill set and knowledge were not enough for this task. I got help from experienced colleagues and mentors. Their insights helped me understand the project and they provided valuable guidance. To apply my learning, I actively engaged with the project teams, implementing newly acquired techniques and tools. I got feedback from mentors and actively went to help sessions to expand my learning. The project began to run more smoothly, with less hassles and improved communication among teams. While challenges remained, my newfound skills and knowledge empowered me to navigate them effectively. This experience taught me the importance of recognizing one's limitations and proactively seeking growth opportunities.",
            "Question 11": "Managing classes and extracurriculars was hard when I first got to college. I felt like I was only giving half of my effort into school work and the organizations. To make the situation manageable, I listed my classes and how many hours of study each needed. I then created a schedule by blocking my class time and study time into time slots. In case my schedule changed, I left room for flexibility. Time management has helped me so much in college and that is a skill I did not have coming into college. I believe that following this study schedule is the main reason I perform well in school and give my dedication to my other organizations."

            "Question 9": "To me, the most meaningful SEC Pillar is the focus on increasing engineering awareness through programs and events. Growing up, I never heard about engineering until the end of middle school, and even then I didn\u2019t know what an engineer was. It was an interesting concept to me though, since most people described them as the ones that \u201cmake technology\u201d or \u201cput spaceships in space,\u201d which just made me think of them as some sort of techno wizard. It wasn\u2019t until high school that I learned that engineers weren\u2019t magical little creatures, which was a bit disappointing, but I also became aware of all the other interesting things that engineers actually do. Because of this, I value spreading awareness over the other two pillars.",
            "Question 10": "An example that a lot of students can relate to is the need to study. I showed up to the first day of class thinking that all I needed to do was pay attention to the lecture and finish my homework on time; however, the first set of exams made me realize that I would have to work hard to get the grades I desired, which was a problem that I had never faced before in my academic career. I felt lost, I didn\u2019t know what parts of the lecture were important enough to write down, and I wasted a lot of time relearning concepts every time I had an exam. I knew I had to do something different, but I didn't know what that something was, so I tried reaching out to people. I got help from former and current A&M students, which allowed me to improve significantly.",
            "Question 11": "English is not my first language, and I am a generally reserved person. This combination of traits (as you can probably guess) makes me a mediocre speaker. I tend to use filler words and often mispronounce atypical words; therefore, I was extremely anxious when taking my high school\u2019s public speaking class. We were expected to stand at the front of a class with a PowerPoint that held an insignificant amount of information and speak on the topic for a minimum of seven minutes. Just thinking about it terrified me, but I knew there was a way to improve. There was a lot of preparation behind every presentation, I often rehearsed and recorded myself to catch any mistakes, which allowed me to be a more competent speaker."

I would like to focus on being apart of the path to a student becoming an engineer completely. That kind of goal-oriented work is important to me personally because I value the work one puts in to reach a final goal.",
            "Question 10": "Working on my research in high school, specifically while developing a physical exercise program for individuals with breast cancer, I needed to be aware of how the exercises would actually help rehabilitate the patients. I was left unaware of exactly how that would happen. Thus, in order to gain the skills and the proper knowledge to create such plans, I had to conduct a thorough meta-analysis on the existing body of knowledge already surrounding physical exercise in reference to breast cancer. After collecting the details of such exercises from pre-existing body of knowledge, I had to centralize only the important details from the information and continue to formulate a plan around it. Eventually, through proper studying and collaboration with my peers doing research in a similar vein, I was able to gain the knowledge needed to solve such an issue.",
            "Question 11": "Specifically, I worked in a research group during my senior year of high school on research regarding the impact of neurotoxins on the mental health and cognitive ability of students. However, during our research I realized the lack of organization and coordination within our group regarding the formulation of a solution. I realized the necessity to coordinate a full-on solution to the issue of making a mask that would block our neurotoxic particles. Thus, I had to allocate different parts of the part of the mask to different research members in order to make a mask that would fully solve the issue of breathing in such neurotoxic particles. However, beyond allocation we also had to establish a bar of communication between all the team members to understand what was necessary in order to formulate the most efficient and fully functional solution to the issue of breathing in polluted particles."

            "Question 10": "A time when I realized that I needed assistance was at the end of my first year at Texas A&M. I was unsatisfied with where I stood academically and I saw no clear path to improve by myself. I went to an academic advisor who pointed me in the direction of an academic coach. These coaches are there to meet weekly to overview your progress as the semester progresses. They assist the student to ensure that there is improvement. They are the bridge to many outlets that connect me to resources that can help me academically or mentally. With this help, I can safely say that there is improvement in both my standings academically and mentally.",
            "Question 11": "When I was younger, I never paid too much attention to my parents' work. They have a freight carrier business that they have been running since 2003. Once I was in high school, I began to notice the mountains of paper and disorganization in their workspaces. I saw how stressful it became to manage everything physical by hand so I proposed another option. I proposed that instead of filing everything away in paper inside filing cabinets, they make the switch to a digital method. It seemed more practical, efficient, and eco-friendly given the piles of paper that truly just collected dust. I offered to teach them how to use this method effectively and they saw the improvement. Of course, it took time to readjust, but whenever I am home, seeing them with a more organized workspace brings me joy."

However, attending the SEC's elevator pitch and resume workshops prepared me far better than I could have predicted. They helped me get into the right mindset for the fair, and needless to say, they worked amazingly. I want to help provide that same assistance to other engineers who are potentially as nervous and uncertain as I was. The development division provides so many opportunities for engineers to engage proactively and slowly build their confidence, just like the workshops, industry nights, and career fair did to me. Through the engineering development committee, I want to help guide those who need it, specifically freshmen that are trying to find their engineering passion. Providing those resources through this committee just as they were provided to me would be my way of showing gratitude.",
            "Question 10": "In highschool, I started my first job as a team member in Taco Cabana. It turned out to be a lot harder than I anticipated, often dealing with being understaffed and busy hours. It got to the point where I was not getting things done correctly due to the overwhelming pace needed to cook and manage multiple things at once, and I realized it was not going to improve until I addressed it. I started cooking more at home. For practice, I would make my family of four a full dinner sometimes. With time, I was able to handle the pressure and pace better at my job. To this day, the way I learned to multitask and manage time like it was life or death in TC helps me manage the amount of assignments and tasks I do every week, ensuring that I'm dealing well with them at all times.",
            "Question 11": "In this summer's SEC directed internship, I realized that my team's communication was not very efficient. We weren't always responsive to each other and miscommunicated in important tasks. I noted this to my team and emphasized that our chemistry could improve so that we could work better together. I decided that the best way to approach this would be to slowly increment the amount of times we met during the week, even if we didn't get anything substantial completed for our project. In addition, I made sure we were aware of each other's tasks in detail, so that if any of us needed help, we could come to each other's aid. As long as we saw and talked with each other, our teamwork would significantly improve. In lieu of that, we started meeting one or two more times during the week than before, and it ultimately paid off."

The reach that SEC has with 400+ companies for 10,000+ students shows how dedicated the members of SEC are to delivering success to their peers. The career fair gave me opportunities I wouldn't have gotten in my own search for internships and helped me gain confidence in my abilities.

Prior to this project, I had never touched any editing software, professional recording devices, or conducted interviews with others. I needed to be prepared for my meetings, so I did about a month of researching the platforms I wanted to use, the best software for podcasting, and anything I needed to know about successful interviewing.. I expanded my communication skills with a range of people, explored new technology, and was left with a cohesive product that I presented to my peers and teachers.",

I conducted a survey to see what snacks would be the most favored and talked to the administration to clear logistical issues. To get the snacks, I went door to door explaining my project and asking for food or monetary donations to purchase food. Once everything was collected, I put the bags together and gave it to the admin for distribution due to privacy laws. This project was rewarding to give back to my community and reduce stress on these families."

I learned that my worth is not determined by what titles I hold but rather the value I place in my relationships and confidence. I realized that the real reason I wanted to be an honors student was to make myself appear more intelligent to others, which is embarrassing to admit now. I spent this first semester becoming secure in who I am regardless of the titles I hold. I also saw this rejection as a means of motivation. I worked hard this semester because Engineering Honors was still a goal of mine.
