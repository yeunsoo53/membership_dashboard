            "Question 7": "While all of SEC\u2019s mission is inspiring, the focus on engineering awareness resonates with me the most. My passion for STEM awareness began with my little sister. Whenever I came home sharing what I\u2019d learned in chemistry or biology, she was always so impressed and begged me to teach her more than the basic curriculum at her elementary school. Her curiosity for STEM inspired me to join SciNOW, a club dedicated to enriching local elementary schools. We led bimonthly lesson plans centered around different areas of science and paired them with hands-on experiments to excite students about their futures. As president, I led SciNOW\u2019s expansion to five different schools and reached over two-hundred students. There\u2019s a strong alignment between SEC\u2019s mission and my own experiences, and I\u2019m excited to bring this same passion here through initiatives like the EnVision conference.",
            "Question 8": "In 8th grade, I had the chance to apply to a high school outside my neighborhood, one with a math and science academy. It had everything I dreamed of - a great orchestra director, advanced math and science classes, and close friends. The catch? It was a 30 minute drive away, and I was stuck with no license and two busy parents. My dad didn\u2019t understand why I wanted to go to a school with a math and science focus when the school I was zoned to focused on engineering. But I was determined to apply, so I did it in a way that I knew my engineering parents understood \u2013 I showed them the problems and gave them my solutions. They were concerned about transportation, so I researched bus routes and gave them our options. They worried about me walking alone to the bus stop, so I arranged to carpool with a friend. Eventually, they respected my passion and allowed me to apply. Reflecting back, I learned how to communicate effectively by considering others\u2019 perspectives and addressing their concerns. I\u2019ve never regretted applying to that high-school and this experience taught me a skill I still use today.",
            "Question 9": "Growing up in Houston, I\u2019ve always been surrounded by diverse cultures, and I see that same richness in the College of Engineering at Texas A&M. Given the opportunity, I\u2019d introduce an Engineering Culture Festival with the SEC. Similar to Aggie Invent, the festival would be a design competition open to all engineering students. Teams of four to five would design inventions representing their unique cultural backgrounds. I\u2019m in love with Teh Tarik, a Malaysian national drink that involves \u201cpulling tea,\u201d so I\u2019d design a machine that is able to pull tea back and forth. Global Programs faculty could serve as judges, grading the designs on creativity, presentation, and market appeal. The objectives would be to raise awareness of cultural diversity within the engineering community, foster teamwork and creativity, and showcase global opportunities for engineering students, such as study abroad programs. By collaborating with students from different backgrounds, participants gain insights into their heritage while developing innovative solutions. With SEC\u2019s experience in design competitions like Ignite, we could create an enjoyable and lighthearted experience for students. The festival would celebrate both the technical and cultural diversity of our engineering community, promoting cross-cultural understanding and embodying SEC\u2019s mission of engineering awareness."

            "Question 7": "What really stands out to me about the SEC mission is the focus on fostering professional advancement for engineering students. As a mentor for the First Generation Engineering (FGEN) program, I've had the chance to help other students navigate challenges I faced when I first started at A&M. From sharing study tips to guiding them toward helpful resources, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how impactful mentorship can be. It\u2019s rewarding to see others gain confidence and grow in their journey, and it\u2019s pushed me to grow, too. Being part of something that uplifts students aligns perfectly with this part of the mission, and I\u2019d love to continue contributing in that way.",
            "Question 8": "During my time with SHPE, I organized a study group for midterms. Initially, I planned for it to be an open session. Still, after seeing how unproductive previous open sessions had been, I decided to limit attendance to smaller, focused groups based on specific classes. Some members didn\u2019t agree and felt it excluded people, but I believed it was the best way to make the study sessions more effective. I explained my reasoning during a meeting, emphasizing the importance of creating a space where everyone could ask questions and collaborate without distractions. To address concerns, I offered to help those who couldn't join by connecting them with others from their classes. The smaller sessions turned out to be much more productive. People stayed longer, asked more questions, and genuinely appreciated the focused environment. Though the decision wasn't popular at first, it reinforced that sometimes making tough calls can lead to better outcomes for everyone.",
            "Question 9": "I'd start a program called \"Engineering Explorations\" to help students discover unique and unexpected areas of engineering. The idea would be to host hands-on workshops, bring in guest speakers, and work on small projects focused on cool topics like green tech, aerospace, and biomedical applications. The goal is to show students that there's way more to engineering than the typical career paths we always hear about. Plus, it\u2019d be a great way to connect people from different majors and get fresh ideas flowing. I think this could have a big impact by helping students see new possibilities for their careers while building a more creative and collaborative community within the College of Engineering. Sometimes, just hearing about an unexpected path or meeting the right person can change how you see your future and that\u2019s what this initiative would be about."

To me, that statistic isn\u2019t just about representation--it\u2019s about whose ideas shape the future of security. Without diversity, engineering is only hindered.\nThe biggest barrier isn't talent; it's visibility. If people don't see others like themselves in engineering, they may never realize it's possible. That's why SEC's external division resonates with me the most, as awareness is how barriers are broken. Coming from the RGV, I never thought about the tech world, let alone a career in it; yet, exposure at A&M changed everything, and I want to pay that forward.\nAs PR for the Cybersecurity Club, I work to increase awareness, connect students with professionals, and create spaces where diverse perspectives thrive. If selected, I hope to make a greater impact and help others realize that engineering is not for a select few, but for those willing to take the leap.",
            "Question 8": "During my high school senior year as Science Olympiad captain, I faced a tough call. Our team had limited funding, and I had to decide whether to send our strongest competitors to invitationals or split resources across all members to give everyone a chance to compete. Many wanted equal participation, and as much as I did too, I knew that to maximize our performance at state, prioritizing our top performers would give us the best shot.\nI never just imposed my decision; instead, I gathered input, explained the stakes, and found a compromise. Through a lot of hard work and persistence, I managed to secure $5,000 in sponsorships to cover more students while keeping our top competitors in critical events. The pressure was high, and not everyone agreed, but I stood by my choice. It all paid off when our team placed top 5 at state for the first time in school history and we all witnessed the value of strategic decision-making.\nI learned that leadership isn\u2019t about pleasing everyone\u2014it\u2019s about problem solving, weighing every option, making tough choices, and proving through action why they were right.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, it would be Project REACH: Real-World Engineering Access & Community Help.\nToo often, engineering feels like a bunch of equations and theories, when in reality, it has the power to change lives. Project REACH would connect TAMU engineering students with communities facing real challenges, working alongside them to develop practical solutions:\n- McAllen's rising obesity rates -> solar-powered sidewalk with light/play zones to encourage physical activity.\n- Houston's flooding/drainage issues -> Smart walkways with built in moisture sensors to improve drainage efficiency.\n- Austin's dangerous cycling conditions -> Motion activated LED bike lanes for safer, energy-efficient commuting.\nThe goal is to make engineering real, applicable, and personal. Students would collaborate in teams with professors/mentors, classmates, and younger high school students that are to learn this process. This would be to not only serve communities, but for students experience how engineering shapes the world beyond the classroom.\nEngineering should never be constrained to textbooks and corporations, it should be for the people. Project REACH wouldn't just build engineers. It would build engineers who care."

            "Question 7": "What resonates with me most about the mission is being a representative voice for all engineering students. Growing up in a low-income Hispanic household, I often bridged language and technology gaps for my family. Whether helping my mom communicate with her boss, translating documents, or ordering appliances online. These experiences taught me the importance of advocacy and accessibility.\nAt Texas A&M, I see a similar need. In such a large, competitive environment, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed; I know I did as a freshman. Imposter syndrome can make it hard to belong, and I want to help others navigate those feelings, find resources, and build confidence. Through SHPE and the Zachry Leadership Program, I\u2019ve gained valuable technical and professional skills, and I want to apply them to make a difference with SEC. Every engineering student deserves to feel seen, heard, and supported, and I would be honored to represent them.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I had to choose between fully focusing on school or taking on more responsibilities at home. My mom worked long hours as a house cleaner, so I helped with cooking, cleaning, and managing bills while juggling AP classes, school organizations, college applications, and working weekends to help with expenses. Some family members told me to prioritize school, while others thought my responsibilities at home should come first.\nI felt guilty either way, but after talking with my mom, she reassured me that focusing on my education was the best way to help in the long run. I built a routine. Waking up earlier to study, meal prepping on Sundays, and using any free time to stay on top of assignments, so I could balance everything without burning out.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, but I made it work. I kept up with my classes, got into Texas A&M, and set an example for my younger cousins. The life skills I learned: time management, adaptability, and perseverance have helped me navigate college, and I know they will continue to serve me in the future. I welcome difficult situations because they push me to grow and create opportunities to learn.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an Engineering Workshop Series to help students develop the interpersonal and professional skills essential for career success. Too often, engineers focus so much on building technical skills that they forget that it is only half the battle. While technical expertise is crucial, the ability to communicate ideas, collaborate effectively, and demonstrate leadership is just as important in securing job offers and excelling in the workplace.\nThis series would include workshops on technical presentations, public speaking, professional writing, and mock interview preparation, helping students clearly voice their ideas and build confidence. It would also feature sessions on teamwork, conflict resolution, and emotional intelligence to prepare students for leadership roles. Self-awareness has played a huge role in my personal and professional growth; whether through journaling or by staying true to my values, I\u2019ve learned that understanding myself has helped me become a better leader and communicator.\nAdditional workshops would cover salary negotiation, networking strategies, and time management, ensuring students are well-equipped to navigate the professional world. By bridging the gap between technical knowledge and real-world workplace expectations, this initiative would empower SEC students to stand out to employers and be fully prepared to succeed in their careers."

            "Question 7": "I especially resonated with the engineering awareness pillar. As an Industrial Distribution major, I can personally say many aspects of engineering are overlooked and is something I\u2019ve experienced firsthand. Coming into college, I initially wanted to pursue a more technical engineering major. However, after being introduced to the distribution aspect of engineering through learning about its applications in industry nights, I became interested in a side of engineering that many students aren\u2019t familiar with. What I appreciate most about the engineering awareness mission is its aim to promote all aspects of engineering, and through its programs, I discovered my current major. Similarly, I\u2019ve demonstrated this value by joining the SWE Outreach Committee, which is designed to teach kids about engineering through hands-on activities. Being part of it allowed me to collaborate with fellow members and help the community understand the importance of engineering and how it shapes our everyday lives.",
            "Question 8": "I previously worked as a certified taekwondo instructor, where, as one of the highest-level black belts, I helped train junior leaders for instructor positions. Following our class on mirror-image, I felt it would be best to revisit the topic, as it\u2019s a difficult concept for students to adapt to and master. However, my fellow instructor felt it would be better to practice on mirror-image\u2019s application to teaching forms, which I felt was too large a jump and disagreed with. Despite our differing opinions, I thought it was important to understand her reasoning, as she felt that application could help students master the concept. While I agreed, I noted that the students needed more practice before application, considering their difficulty during the previous class. We compromised by dedicating the first portion of class to revisiting mirror image, ensuring students were more comfortable with it before engaging on its application in the second half. Our revised approach allowed students to better understand the topic, having had ample independent practice, solidifying their understanding through group work. Through this experience, I learned the importance of communication and compromise, and the value of being open to different perspectives while encountering a disagreement.",
            "Question 9": "Given the chance to create a new initiative for SEC, I would pitch a SEC career accelerator workshop series. Given the prominence of the SEC\u2019s career fair and SEC\u2019s pre-career fair week, creating a series of workshops, perhaps the week after each career fair, focusing on actions to follow after attending a career fair would help enhance student\u2019s career readiness and success finding opportunities. Through actions such as setting up mock interviews and feedback sessions, teaching career fair follow up tasks on linkedin, and curating list of internship roles based on major and focus would allow for students to gain a stronger understanding on how industry works and strengthen career confidence. In addition, by partnering with the Texas A&M Career Center, we could expand the resources available and make it more accessible and visible to engineering students. Such initiatives would bridge the gap between attending career fairs and securing internships and job opportunities, helping students gain needed skills to effectively navigate their future careers in industry."

            "Question 8": "A very difficult time for me was when I was a counselor for FORME, my freshman leadership organization. We were put in an unfortunate situation and were facing issues with the university. My family was worried - they urged me to distance myself to protect my educational future. I was torn between my role as a counselor and stepping down. When faced with this difficult decision I thought back to my freshman year, and how this organization has genuinely changed my life. I thought about how my counselors brought me out of my shell, and helped me find my voice.\nDespite others stepping down, I decided to stay, believing the chance to make a difference in these freshmen's lives was worth the risk. Looking back, it was absolutely the right choice. Not only did our organization successfully move forward, but I had the privilege of watching my freshmen grow, build confidence, and find their own paths at A&M. I've realized that sometimes when you are put in a tough spot, you realize what you value the most. For me, that is being there for others when they need it.",
            "Question 9": "Growing up with my dad being a software engineer, I was lucky to discover programming young. I remember working on my first project, making a Minecraft mod, and seeing my code affect my favorite game in real-time. But not every kid has someone at home to guide them through those first lines of code. That's why I want to create a coding boot camp \u2013 a week-long program where we can share excitement with kids in the Bryan-College Station community. Twice a semester, we'd work with small groups, teaching programming basics through what kids already love \u2013 games, robots, and creative projects. By the end of each camp, they'd have their very own project to show off - maybe their first game or a robot they programmed themselves. This program would fill a key gap in SEC's outreach. While EnVision does incredible work introducing engineering broadly, I believe we can make an even bigger impact by creating this focused programming experience. I want to give kids the same opportunity I had when I was young \u2013 especially those with less resources at home. It's not just about teaching code, it's about opening doors and showing kids they can be creators."

Despite my plan\u2019s logic, half the group resisted, arguing they\u2019d rather pay extra for personal snacks than compromise. Tensions rose as we debated in the lodge: some felt I was controlling; others worried about fairness. Recognizing the stalemate, I suggested a vote. To my surprise, the group split 6-5 against my idea. Rather than pushing harder, I pivoted: we\u2019d split essentials (eggs, pasta) but allocate a portion of the budget for individual snacks. This hybrid approach preserved unity while respecting preferences. Initially, I felt frustrated\u2014my \u2018perfect\u2019 plan was rejected. But by listening, I realized autonomy mattered more to some than savings. The trip succeeded, and surprisingly, most chose to share snacks voluntarily by the end.

As crew lead I had to make the decision to modify our route, bypassing Mount Phillips, an expected highlight of the trip.\nThere was initially disagreement about the decision because many non sick people wanted to continue the harder route, so we had a cordial group discussion where everyone on the trek gave their input on what they wanted to do and why.\nIn the end we concluded we had to bypass mount phillips, so the affected individuals could have more time to rest and recover from the flu.\nSince making this decision as crew lead I\u2019ve learned how important it is for everyone to understand the reasoning behind why certain decisions are made, and how you can have much more success convincing people of your reasoning if they have a chance to hear your reasoning as well as give their own input.",
            "Question 9": "It may be outside of the scope of the Organization, but I feel like an initiative within the SEC focused on tutoring and advising students taking engineering related classes could be very helpful for students at TAMU, and it aligns well with the SEC\u2019s mission of representing engineering students.\nThe objective of the program would be to target engineering students who may need extra help in their classes and tutor them up to a full understanding of the material. This could possibly increase the retention rates of engineering students at Texas A&M by improving their understanding of the material which would in turn increase their grades.\nThis could be implemented into the SEC in a volunteer based fashion where members who are interested in Volunteering could sign up to tutor based on interest and possibly even partner with existing campus resources.\nOverall I think this initiative could provide a valuable service to engineering students at Texas A&M and would be a good addition to the SEC\u2019s objectives."

            "Question 8": "As Vietnamese Student Association Co-Social interns, my partner and I would oftentimes have disagreements on what sort of events would yield the best results in terms of turnout and participation. We both had strong ideas and different approaches which oftentimes slowed down progress and made compromises increasingly difficult as we were constantly stuck in the planning phase. However, instead of letting disagreements interrupt our flow of progress and learning, we restructured how we thought our partnership should work and allocated minor events as individual tasks and left the major events as group tasks. This allowed us each to take the lead with our own ideas while also providing input and advice however needed whenever the other person required it. Over time, this approach allowed us to play to our strengths and actualize our visions while also ensuring that the organization had properly thought out and diverse events to go to. Through this experience, I learned that leadership is not always about being in agreement with your partner or board, but rather finding a balance, trusting your team, and knowing when to step back and support them instead of taking charge.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an initiative similar to a boot camp ran by SEC, designed to provide students with hands-on training in high-demand areas that would allow the students to gain the technical expertise so that they can apply to internships, jobs, or personal projects. This would focus primarily on areas such as full-stack development, machine learning, data science, cloud computing, and other rapidly growing fields. It could either be organized as multiple workshops throughout the year or a single semester, ensuring that students get an in-depth learning. During the workshops, industry professionals would break down their day to day work life, the challenges and projects that they work on, as well as the tools they most often use. This would provide students with insights on how they can apply their knowledge in a professional setting and have an idea of what tools they should focus on learning. The ultimate goal of this program would be to allow students to stand a better chance in the job market as they would have a stronger understanding and ability in the tools used in professional environments which also aligns with SEC's mission to prepare students for successful careers."

            "Question 8": "As a newly ten-year-old licensed referee, my first game was far from my expectations. Stepping on the field to officiate a U-17 men\u2019s club soccer matchup, the game quickly spiraled into an intense faceoff. At one point, I called a handball that had the potential to decide the match, and one team\u2019s parents started screaming bloody murder at me, relentlessly heckling and belittling me for my call. Faced with the decision to reverse my call under external pressure, I reflected on why I became a licensed official in the first place\u2014to further my passion for my beloved sport and to commit to being an impartial referee, one who would make the correct decisions even when challenged. Despite racial slurs being hurled upon me, I did not reverse my call, a move that I am proud of to this day and one that would define my referee career to come. Going back on my call would have been easier, yet in that moment I gained confidence in myself and my ability to officiate after having it be intensely challenged by the parents. Following that match, I had an eight-year-long referee career and eventually earned most courageous referee honors.",
            "Question 9": "To further SEC\u2019s impact through engineering awareness with first-year engineering students, I\u2019m interested in creating the Engineering Freshman Case Competition. This event would be sponsored by a corporate partner, and first-year engineering students would form teams and work together to solve a problem presented by the company. Although similar to the SEC Ignite Design Challenge, the difference is that this initiative would be exclusively for first-year students and offer the opportunity to work with a corporate partner. Through this sponsorship, SEC would continue to develop industry relationships while simultaneously providing a space for freshmen engineering students to develop the necessary skills to be successful as future engineers. This initiative would also allow students to learn more about their potential ETAM choices by allowing them an inside look into the day-to-day life of an engineer. Having students work through the entire process of building a presentation from the ground up is valuable because of the necessity for these skills in industry, as engineers are asked to communicate their work on a daily basis. In addition, company representatives could help judge the competition, providing a unique opportunity for students to practice their networking skills and begin to develop relationships with company representatives."

            "Question 8": "In the final moments of my national NASA coding competition, my team faced a split decision. With five minutes left in our final run, three of my four teammates were ready to give up, convinced that our code, thoroughly full of bugs, was beyond saving. They believed our chances of finishing in time were lost and argued amongst themselves, ultimately leaving the competition early. I decided to continue, working with my remaining teammate and dividing the tasks: he debugged while reading the code aloud, and I pieced together the missing sections. The pressure drove us to succeed, and we rose to the challenge. I wasn\u2019t about to let the opportunity slip by without giving it everything I had. Our desperate attempt worked, and our code ran successfully. We ended up making it to the top 25 teams in the next round. Even if we hadn\u2019t succeeded, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my decision. When faced with a difficult situation, it\u2019s always better to plan and give it your all rather than just giving up.

            "Question 8": "I was working on a startup developing a challenge-driven wellness app to help users stay active through friendly competitions. Our diverse team, ranging from college students to physicians, often clashed on design decisions. The generational gap shaped these differences\u2014while younger members favored gamification and social connectivity, physicians prioritized a more distraction-free experience, emphasizing practicality and minimal digital fatigue.\nA major conflict arose when I proposed a social-media-inspired approach with real-time updates, streaks, and notifications to boost engagement, while others worried that excessive alerts would overwhelm users and reduce long-term adherence. Instead of debating, I reframed the discussion by asking: What problem are we solving? This shifted our focus from individual preferences to the core user experience. Through brainstorming and behavioral research, we developed a structured check-in system that allowed users to personalize engagement levels and receive curated updates at optimal times, avoiding unnecessary distractions.\nThis solution balanced motivation with usability, satisfying both sides while maintaining the app\u2019s core purpose. More importantly, it reinforced that the best solutions don\u2019t emerge from simply choosing one side, but from rethinking the problem, bridging perspectives, and designing with both engagement and impact in mind.",
            "Question 9": "One initiative SEC could implement is a community-driven service project that leverages the diverse talents of engineering students to raise awareness and education about engineering in everyday life. This program would connect our student body with the greater Bryan-College Station community, offering practical engineering-based services while fostering real-world applications of our skills.\nThrough a structured volunteer platform, students could assist small businesses with finishing touches on new construction projects, help elderly residents set up laptops and home technology, or support local schools with STEM outreach. Beyond direct services, this initiative could also include hands-on learning opportunities, such as biweekly coding workshops led by computer science students or DIY home repair sessions where single parents learn fundamental engineering concepts.\nBy bridging the gap between students and the community, this initiative would demonstrate the real-world impact of engineering, encourage civic engagement, and empower people with practical knowledge that improves their daily lives."

            "Question 8": "I realized after two months as the director of CARPOOL our organization had a serious problem. Our funds were quickly depleting and budget cuts had to be made. Our leadership team had several intense discussions about the issue. I saw the only solution that could realistically save the organization was to sell \u201cThe Lime\u201d, the property CARPOOL owned for over 20 years. I felt torn because \u201cThe Lime\u201d was a part of our identity and we had many memories there. Despite my reluctance, I felt it was important to voice this as a viable solution. Others were initially resistant.\nDuring the meeting, I suggested we brainstorm more options that would avoid selling \u201cThe Lime.\u201d Unfortunately none of the ideas could generate enough money to sustain the organization. I gently made the observation that selling was the only realistic solution and if we could complete the sale by the end of the year, we would be able to continue operations while we found a new place on campus. Although some members were hesitant at first, because I was transparent and presented the facts clearly, everyone eventually came around to agree to the sale to project our main mission, fighting drunk driving.",

I want to eliminate students missing out on courses that interest them, or having to delay graduation, simply because they were unaware of this information early in their studies.\nEngineering Mentors (E&M) would be an event that connects a group of freshmen and sophomore engineers to upperclassmen who are currently in their desired fields. This project would help solve the main issue underclassmen face: experience. Whether it\u2019s advice on specific courses or exploring subspecialties, E&M could provide timely guidance. Modeled after SEC\u2019s company meet and greets, seniors and graduate students at A&M would talk about their journey to younger students who could learn what to expect early and give them time to plan to avoid roadblocks. E&M would create a student body more aware of all the amazing possibilities A&M can provide, creating a better future for A&M engineers."

            "Question 8": "A time where I was challenged with a difficult decision was through a game of basketball. During my sophomore year, we were playing against our rivals. It was the final seconds of a tight game, and the ball was in my hands. The obvious choice was to pass to our leading scorer, but he\u2019d been off all night. Instead, I took the shot myself, draining a deep three, winning us the game.\nThough my choice led us to victory, not everyone agreed with my decision. Some teammates thought I should\u2019ve trusted the play drawn by coach. But in that moment, I had to trust my instincts over expectations. I handled the situation by owning my choice, knowing that leadership sometimes means making the controversial call.\nThe outcome was victory, but also tension. Some teammates saw confidence while others saw it as ego. Over time, I worked to rebuild trust, proving that my choice wasn\u2019t about selfishness but about reading the game differently. This moment taught me that difficult decisions won\u2019t always be accepted. In basketball and in life there is no such thing as the \"right\" choice, only the one you believe in.",
            "Question 9": "An initiative I would take is to make DI Saturday personal and transparent to the freshmen engineering students. The event is informational and helpful for Aggie engineering students but making a personal connection with these students can aid them in choosing their majors. The way to achieve this is to consult with engineers in different fields and have them record a day in their life at work. Then, these videos can be incorporated into the presentations. This will give students insight on the different engineering fields they might be drawn to.\nThe objectives through this project is to increase awareness through different majors, make careers relatable, and to guide them in making such a difficult career choice. The potential impact would be connecting the classroom to the real world, making engineering feel real rather than abstract. It inspires the students to pursue engineering by seeing relatable role models in these various fields. It also allows SEC to collaborate with more companies and alumni, strengthening the Aggie network further. By showing students these different types of engineers in action can further clarify their decisions in picking their major and help them envision their future in engineering."

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC mission that resonates most is fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students. In October I had the privilege of representing Texas A&M as a Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities ambassador at their national conference. The program offered us workshops that explained how to strategize and use campus resources to create growth opportunities for students. This experience challenged me to analyze how to use already available resources to bridge them with a new opportunity that engineering students would benefit from. I developed a structed plan for a program that through the SEC, can help guide students to identify career goals, create actionable plans, and take steps to accomplish them. The SEC offers an opportunity to take the vision I have further, by combining the councils resources with my own experience, to advance engineering students professional development and help them obtain their personal and goals.",
            "Question 8": "This past summer I did research with a team, and we worked on implementing an object detection program for a robot. We were struggling to find a method to convert pixel coordinates to 3D real world units. The lab\u2019s primary investigator (PI) insisted on using a specific method, but when we tested her approach, we found that it was time-consuming, the conversions were inaccurate, and didn\u2019t deliver the expected results. We suggested to the PI to let us test other methods we had read about, but she initially dismissed it and insisted on her idea. However, we had an interview/demo coming up with Washington post. Me and the team weren\u2019t content with the current results, but they told me just go along with what the PI instructed us. I wasn\u2019t conformed so, despite the pressure, I began to investigate other alternatives and performed several trials which led me to discover a method that showed a significant improvement in accuracy and consistency. I presented the data of the trials to the PI, and after seeing the improvement, she agreed to implement this new method in our project. I learned not to settle for conformity and to challenge ideas to improve outcomes.",
            "Question 9": "The SEC offers valuable resources like the career fair, industry panels, and workshops that expose A&M engineering students to connections and career opportunities, that help set goals and visions. However, there is a gap between students and their goals. It is the absence of a career path plan. Many students have clear end goals, but don\u2019t know how to get there. I know many qualified peers that struggle to advance their career because they can\u2019t secure an internship or research position due to the lack of a clear and actionable plan that could make them competitive candidates. I propose the Pathways to Engineering Success Program (PESP). It is a program that through the SEC, provides a structured milestone-based plan to support students alongside all the amazing resources already offered. Each student would create a template that serves as a guide that breaks down long-term career aspirations into attainable milestones. For example, if a student\u2019s goal is to secure an internship in a specific field by the end of their sophomore year, the PESP would help them identify relevant organizations, projects, certificated and skills to prepare them to become more confident and successful candidates within the engineering community at A&M."

I think it is important that there is a legislative body of students to represent us and to organize in our benefit, raise problems and ideas, and to lead the multitude of engineers we have at a prestigious school like A&M. I have reflected similar values in my day to day life by continuously speaking up for others when needed. Whether it involves a question that somebody is too afraid to ask, clearing misinformation about somebody, or simply providing confidence to somebody, all show that I am a very outspoken person regarding these areas.",
            "Question 8": "In November 2024, I participated in the SEC Ignite Design Challenge under the Computer Science track, where my team created a Vendor POS system inspired by Five Guys. With my prior experience working there, we aimed to replicate their system. Split into frontend and backend teams, I worked on the frontend. Throughout the week, we made significant progress, but by the Saturday deadline, it was clear we wouldn't have time to connect both sides. After a lot of stress and thinking, I proposed focusing instead on the presentation and showcasing the functionalities of each side separately. While one teammate was uncertain and another disagreed, we ultimately decided to prioritize the presentation . This decision paid off, and we delivered a polished report and presentation, and we ended up being placed in third! This experience taught us the value of strategic thinking and collaboration during disagreements. showing that with the hard decisions come the most benefit.",
            "Question 9": "A new initiative I would propose for the SEC would be an event like the Ignite Design Challenge, but with more real world problems that surround the College Station or Bryan area in general. This would expose students to a more real world application of their engineering coursework, as well as insight on how powerful the problem solving mindset that engineers have is to the real world. Challenges could come arise from local businesses or the local government that propose certain problems that have risen which would be compatible in a competition environment, where teams would go head to head trying to create as well as pitch the best solution to the organization or business with the problem. Winners could possibly receive a prize of some sort or funding to see their idea come to life. This initiative would bridge engineering coursework and experience to local industry and problems, fostering creativity, problem solving, and a better Aggieland overall."

            "Question 8": "\"Anish, I would like to be a co-founder.\"\nThis was the unexpected request I received from two of my team members while I was working on SLCA, a student-led consulting organization that helps local businesses grow. As the project lead, I had helped shape the vision and initial structure of the organization, and this request caught me off guard.\nI knew that being listed as a co-founder wasn't simply about time or effort but about the foundational role and decisions made in the early stages. While I respected my colleagues\u2019 contributions, I had to weigh their impact against the long-term vision of the organization. I chose to have an open conversation, where I explained that while their involvement had been invaluable, the co-founder title was reserved for those who had helped define the direction of the organization from the start.\nIt was a difficult conversation, but by acknowledging their efforts and suggesting other ways to recognize their leadership\u2014such as in senior roles within the organization\u2014they understood my perspective. The outcome was positive; as we strengthened our communication and continued to work together effectively, with everyone feeling valued and respected in their own respective ways.",
            "Question 9": "I would create the SEC Engineering Crisis Simulation, an intensive, real-time design and decision-making challenge where students must respond to unexpected engineering failures or urgent real-world scenarios under time pressure, similar to how it is in the real-world. Unlike traditional design competitions where teams have multiple weeks and extensive resources at hand to develop a solution, this initiative would simulate the high-stakes engineers face in the industry\nFor example, teams could be tasked with responding to an unexpected structural failure in a high-rise, an autonomous vehicle software malfunction, or an emergency power outage in a hospital. They would receive limited information upfront, with new challenges and constraints revealed periodically\u2014such as budget cuts, changing environmental factors, or changing resources. The teams would then rapidly prototype solutions, simulate outcomes, and present their final emergency response plan to a panel of engineers and industry experts, kind of like a Shark Tank pitch but for engineers.\nThe goal is to teach students how to navigate engineering under uncertainty, work under pressure, and balance technical reality with real-world constraints\u2014all critical skills for leadership roles in engineering. Winning teams could have their solutions showcased to industry leaders or gain fast-track access to internships, reinforcing incentives for student participation."

One specific part that resonates the most with me is increasing engineering awareness through programs and events. I believe that engineering plays a huge role in shaping the world and the people around us. It is essential to inspire students and understand the struggles that come with pursuing such a rigorous degree. I have demonstrated this value to the best of my ability by volunteering to help STEM outreach programs in my community while here at A&M and my hometown, where I have introduced younger students to engineering concepts through hands-on projects like catapult building challenges and math workshops to help further their knowledge into an advanced subject. Through these efforts, I have seen how exposure to engineering at a young age can spark interest and confidence in students who may not have considered the field before.",
            "Question 8": "As the Orchid Ball Director for the sorority Phi Sigma Rho, I am responsible for planning the semi-formal and formal for all members and their dates. Throughout the process of planning an event of such a large caliber, I faced difficult decisions, especially when balancing budget, venue preferences, and differing expectations and wants from fellow directors and VPs. Many members had conflicting requests regarding the dress theme, food, and music, making it nearly impossible to satisfy everyone. To handle this, I focused on making decisions that would benefit the whole chapter rather than trying to cater to everyone\u2019s specific wants. I gathered feedback from everyone, prioritized key factors that aligned with our budget and vision, and communicated about my choices to my uppers. While some did not get what they wanted, everyone had a great time, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. By staying firm while keeping open communication, I ensured the best possible outcome for the entire organization to have a very successful semiformal last fall.",
            "Question 9": "As a member of SEC, I would create an initiative dedicated to highlighting smaller and lesser known engineering majors and showcasing their unique opportunities they offer students. Most of the time, less common engineering disciplines don\u2019t receive as much attention, leading students to overlook potential career paths that might align with their interests and skills. Although DI Saturday can help this, seeing only two presentations per semester still limits the number of majors a student can consider early on. The objective of this initiative would be to broaden every students\u2019 knowledge of different engineering fields and their pathways by featuring one or a few different smaller majors each day. This week or two could include guest speakers, social media spotlights, industry panels, and interactive showcases from students and faculty in those fields. By providing insight into these specialized areas, students can make more informed decisions about their academic and professional paths. The impact of this project would provide many benefits. It would promote collaboration within the College of Engineering and ensure that all students, regardless of major, feel recognized and valued, along with connecting students with faculty and industry professionals, helping them discover new career opportunities, previously unknown."

            "Question 8": "As undergraduate researchers, my colleagues and I were responsible for fabricating microfluidic chips, ensuring the quality didn\u2019t deteriorate as we made each one. After obtaining inconsistent results, the PhD student instructed us to find the problem and develop a solution to maximize quality. My group wanted to focus on the chip-cutting process and were against looking at the curing time in the oven as they thought that was not an issue. As a result, I assisted them with investigating the cutting, and then, during my own time, I set up chips to cure for longer than what was recommended and brought them to the PhD student to test out. To everyone\u2019s surprise, these new chips were much more consistent.\nThis experience taught me the importance of taking initiative while also respecting team input. I didn\u2019t want to push aside my team\u2019s ideas so I helped them test their hypothesis while also taking responsibility for testing a solution I believed in. By doing so, I demonstrated my willingness to adapt to the team and still pursue my approach. I was able to successfully navigate a conflict and take responsibility for the outcome, all while having a supportive team dynamic.",
            "Question 9": "A new initiative for SEC could be a leadership program for freshman engineers. Students accepted into this semester-long program would get a unique opportunity to organize a small event at the end of the semester.

            "Question 7": "To me, advancing the professional interests of engineering students at Texas A&M is one of the most significant pillars of SEC. In my experience, I have seen how some students with immense potential can struggle without the correct guidance to achieve their goals. This is something I saw when I tutored kids studying for the SAT. During this time, I realized that many students just needed the correct support in order to achieve their academic goals. I believe that SEC's commitment to providing students with opportunities such as the Career Fair, resume workshops, and Industry Nights is important as it provides the correct resources to those who need it. I hope to contribute to this mission by helping create or manage existing initiatives within SEC to help students achieve their full potential. With this, I hope to play a part in helping talented students make their mark in the world.",
            "Question 8": "During this year\u2019s TAMUHack, my team and I were deciding how to structure our approach in order to maximize our chances at winning a challenge. One of our teammates wanted to build functionality into our app that would allow us to qualify for all challenges. On the other hand, I wanted to focus on building functionality for one or two challenges, focusing on an intuitive user interface and a more polished final product.\nTo make the decision, we discussed the pros and cons of each approach. My teammate argued that entering multiple challenges would allow us to maximize our odds at winning a prize. I argued that being focused on building the best application would allow us to be more competitive in the challenge we choose to enter.\nAfter evaluating all aspects of the decision, we chose to focus on building for a select few challenges. With any decision like this, it is important to consider all options to make the best decision. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that every team member feels heard, regardless of what the final decision is. By doing this, better decisions can be made that can drive projects forward and create better final outcomes.",
            "Question 9": "During my freshman year of college, I remember being overwhelmed with various aspects of college life. Choosing the right classes, picking campus organizations to join, and going through internship recruitment all felt unfamiliar and complicated. For many freshmen, this is a common experience.\nSomething that would have helped me during this time would have been guidance from someone who had gone through a similar experience. This is why I would create an SEC mentorship program for first semester freshmen where they will be mentored by an upperclassman SEC member. The goal of the program would be to provide freshmen with a resource to ask questions and learn from someone else\u2019s experiences. With this, freshmen will be able to navigate their first year better and make the correct decisions toward their career goals. Furthermore, once these students become upperclassmen and eventual members of SEC, they could give back by mentoring future freshmen, creating a cycle of support and empowerment within the engineering community. By building this program, I would hope to make the transition to college less daunting and confusing for future freshmen in engineering."

            "Question 7": "Among SEC\u2019s missions, the one that resonates with me most is increasing engineering awareness. Attending a university with one of the largest engineering enrollments makes it easy for students to feel overwhelmed and miss out on valuable opportunities. While I\u2019m familiar with events like Wellness Week, the Pre-Career Fair Workshop, and E-Week, I\u2019ve noticed that many of my engineering peers are unaware of these resources.\nAs an officer in a freshman leadership organization, I have actively worked to increase awareness by mentoring first-year students and helping them navigate college. For instance, I introduced a freshman to a research position; without already being in the computer science department, he would never have known about such an opportunity. I also encouraged them to attend Wellness Week, where we went to get coffee as one of the events. These moments reaffirm my love for helping others discover opportunities that better their engineering journey.",
            "Question 8": "Last semester, I participated in a coding project. Originally, the project\u2019s goal was to create a web app that suggests playlists using machine learning to analyze the users\u2019 taste based on specific scales such as acousticness , danceability, etc.\nWe faced many challenges such as our lack of experience developing machine learning models, and finding a consistent meeting time, causing the group\u2019s morale to be dropped. Toward the end, the back-end team were unaware of the actual goal, our team shrunk down to just five contributing members. At that point, I suggested scaling down the project by prioritizing the recommendation algorithm over complex features. While not everyone initially agreed with my proposal because it wasn\u2019t what we planned, we decided to do a functional prototype.\nThe outcome of this experience taught me the importance of adaptability and compromise. I learned that being an effective team member means understanding when difficult decisions need to be made. By observing team members, making strategic compromises, we turned a struggle to a learning-based project where we acquired new skill in machine learning. This experience shows me that teamwork is not about pushing personal ideas, but it\u2019s about working together towards a common goal.",
            "Question 9": "One of SEC\u2019s core missions is professional development, an important goal for many college students including myself. First-year students often step foot on campus, lacking essential skills such as leadership, collaboration, and professionalism to make an instant impact. To address this, I would establish a Freshman Engineering Representatives (FER) as a SEC\u2019s committees. This initiative would select three dedicated first-year representatives within the first month of their first semester, giving them an early opportunity to engage in leadership roles. The FER would provide freshmen with hands-on experience in planning and executing major SEC events such as engineering fairs, workshops, and E-Week, all within a supportive learning environment. Additionally, participants would receive mentorship from experienced upperclassmen who have held leadership positions within SEC. This program would not only prepare first-year students for future leadership roles but also create a structured pathway for them to grow within SEC without immediately competing with upperclassmen for positions. By fostering leadership early, the FER can strengthen SEC\u2019s future by equipping students with the confidence and experience needed to make a lasting impact throughout their college careers."

This is exactly how many of my peers and I felt when one of our favorite clubs, DECA, dissolved due to a teacher quitting. After a few months of trying to fill the hole that DECA left, I decided to start the Young Entrepreneurs Society. Although it was not DECA, it closely mirrored it.

            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, I would start a mentorship program to connect current pre-ETAM students (freshman-sophomore) to post-ETAM students (sophomore, primarily junior-seniors). This program would benefit freshman and pre-ETAM students because they are connected with a student who has gone through the ETAM process and has a network to connect with their mentee. For example, a mentor has more knowledge of the clubs and opportunities on campus and has even participated in some of these events and organizations. This mentor can then pass down their knowledge to the mentee to help them grow as students and feel like they fit better within the engineering program. Another part of the program would be connecting post-ETAM students to an alumni who has the career they are looking into. This connection would be more professional, helping the mentee through career fairs, helping them prepare for job interviews, and connecting them to others in that specific field they are interested in. A mentorship program would be highly beneficial to our Aggie engineers and can significantly expand their professional networks and make our already outstanding Aggies unparalleled in the industry."

As a former Boy Scout, I have also embraced similar values of service, leadership, and personal growth.I was a Patrol Leader, and my tasks included planning hikes, setting up campfires, and teaching survival skills. Yet, the badges and accolades were mere accessories compared to the leadership role I had taken on. For instance, I was responsible for \"Trail to First Class\" (TFC), a program aimed at facilitating the growth of younger Scouts. Under my wing, recruits learned to tie knots and read compasses. These experiences honed my leadership abilities and instilled in me a commitment to uplifting others\u2014a value I see reflected in the SEC's dedication to empowering engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "I participated in my school's FTC robotics programming team during high school. Cooperation with the technical team was crucial as we designed and constructed various robot components. I was tasked with building the mechanism for the linear slides, which presented a significant problem. Although my suggested design prioritized programming accuracy and speed, it unintentionally increased the complexity and time required for the engineering team to create and deploy the slides. Tensions developed as we discussed the best course of action after the engineers voiced reservations about my design's viability. After considering this, I chose to stick with my design because it would perform best in the long run. However, to address their concerns, I worked closely with the engineering team to streamline their process and offered programming solutions that minimized their workload. Ultimately, the team successfully integrated the linear slides, and the robot performed exceptionally well during competitions. This experience taught me the importance of balancing diverse perspectives, communicating effectively, and making decisions that benefit the team, even when not everyone initially agrees. It reinforced my ability to navigate challenges with a collaborative and solutions-oriented mindset.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for the SEC, it would be Professor Coffee Chats! Students and lecturers sometimes only communicate in the classroom, which restricts the chance for deep ties. Through the establishment of a casual setting where students can interact with faculty members over coffee, this program would promote candid communication, mentoring, and teamwork. By lowering barriers and increasing academics' approachability, the program hopes to inspire students to ask for help with their studies, careers, and personal growth.\nThese informal interactions could also spark new ideas for research, projects, or initiatives, benefiting both students and faculty. This initiative promotes a stronger sense of community, enhances the learning experience, and ensures students feel supported in their academic journeys by bridging the gap between classroom instruction and personal connection. Professor Coffee Chats would encourage a more inclusive and dynamic educational culture within the SEC."

As I transitioned from high school to college, I felt burdened by the professional expectations of being an engineering student. However, when I attended events like the career fair and industry nights, I got to network with company professionals and learn what skills would help me develop professionally and as a person. Thus, it became easy for me to navigate as a student by prioritizing valuable opportunities.\nI demonstrated a similar value by bringing together friends and colleagues from classrooms and social circles. We aimed to improve our technical and soft skills, share resources, and review resumes.

At SEC, I aim to help students make the most of their time as Aggies and become successful professionals.",
            "Question 8": "During a recent Hackathon, my team and I aimed to develop an innovative application using complex frameworks, technology, and machine learning models. As we were working on the application, it became clear to me that we would not be able to complete it before the submission deadline. However, my team members were not convinced to change our project last minute and work on another project and argued that brainstorming a new idea and working on it would also not be feasible. I expressed my concern to them and pitched a simpler version of our original application with less complex features keeping our overall vision aligned with the original idea. I explained that we could still complete the application after the hackathon without having to miss the deadline and risking our team\u2019s disqualification. We successfully submitted a functional project and continued working on the remaining features after the hackathon. Right now we\u2019re in the final stages of completing the application with all the originally planned features. This experience taught me the importance of prioritization, adaptability, communication, and quick thinking during tight deadlines.",
            "Question 9": "During my first semester in college, I found it hard to reach out to people for advice because I had no prior experience in my field and hesitated to approach seniors and professors. Although the career fair and industry nights gave me confidence and helped me gain insights into the industry, I found it hard to find opportunities for beginners with no experience. To ensure that freshmen don\u2019t face the same challenges, I came up with the idea of a starter-to-stellar freshmen program. The program is designed to help students to start their professional journeys. The program would introduce freshmen to on-campus opportunities to enrich their college experience. Through the numerous workshops and events, students will explore career opportunities, learn how to craft their resumes as beginners and learn how to network and reach out to professionals in the industry. The program will also provide chances to network with senior and junior Aggies who have industry-relevant experience, creating a supportive environment for career-related advice. This program has the potential to help freshmen kickstart their careers, get involved, and stay informed about valuable opportunities."

Thus we decided to explore alternatives from other vendors and found much cheaper options that were more technologically advanced compared to the existing vendor's inventory. Thus, we decided to tell our supervisor and showcased a comparison study between the products of the different vendors. Although our supervisor was impressed by the work we had put in, he opposed our suggestions, believing the importance of maintaining existing relations with the current vendor. After that, we came up with a game plan that not only takes our supervisor's thoughts into consideration but also reflects our research and proposed a compromise plan where most of the inventory would come from newer vendors for cheaper costs, but the other remaining inventory would come from the existing vendor. Next, we showcased this plan to our supervisor and he approved this plan, which not only helped maintain and generate new relations, but also reduced significant hardware procurement costs.",

This role involved leading multidisciplinary teams to implement changes in the existing Model Y manufacturing line. I frequently lead tests of new parts to see how they are integrated into existing infrastructure. These tests involved many decisions that impacted production schedules and decisions were often daunting to make because every minute of downtime could cost the company thousands. One particular time was during the implementation of new brake lines. These are obviously critical components for safety, and when we encountered issues during the test I had to make the decision on multiple occasions to stop the line. I received pushback from certain team members and it was difficult to make that call as only an intern, but I felt my decision was justified out of concern for customer safety. In the end, the issues were resolved. The biggest thing I learned was that at times you have to be ok with making the tough decisions as long as you can justify them with sound reasoning.",
            "Question 9": "A fun new SEC initiative could be a design challenge across different engineering departments.

In high school, my exposure to engineering came too late as I decided to pursue engineering my senior year. Existing high school engineering programs available to me at the time felt as if they only gave a very simplified surface-level look into the profession leaving me more confused in the end. This experience made me realize the impact of having programs dedicated to introducing students to engineering. I actively support friends through their ETAM process and help my younger sister\u2019s friends who are considering pursuing engineering in college by sharing my experiences and answering any questions they have to the best of my ability.

            "Question 8": "A difficult decision that comes to mind is accepting my admission into Texas A&M. When I first received my admission I learned that I had been accepted to the Galveston campus. I convinced myself that starting at Galveston would diminish my college experience. My parents encouraged me to look into full 4-year options at other schools, and I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t start considering them. To organize my thoughts, I carefully weighed the pros and cons. Engineering at A&M is highly regarded, but I was concerned about how a transfer would affect me. I would only study at Galveston for one year and still experience College Station. If I could adapt around this it would lead to significant personal growth. My parents held their doubts, but I felt that this was a risk worth taking. After that first year, I don\u2019t regret it one bit. I realized that college is a college no matter where one studies. My college experience is not defined by the cards I am dealt. Just because Galveston wasn\u2019t the typical experience for most, didn\u2019t mean it would stop me from getting what I wanted out of college.",
            "Question 9": "When brainstorming for this question, I looked into SEC\u2019s external programs such as the Envision Scholars program and the philanthropy committee. What stood out to me, was how these programs bring engineering awareness to K-12 communities. In addition to these programs, I believe that holding informational sessions for parents of high school students interested in pursuing engineering could be beneficial for both the student and parent. Information about these sessions could be forwarded to parents by collaborating with school counselors. The first objective of this initiative would be to give parents a general outline of the application process and how they can support their child's interests in engineering. The secondary objective would be to address any questions parents may have. Lastly, the tertiary objective is to work with academic advisors to redirect parents to a more qualified resource to answer any questions out of our scope. We as students hold a lot of insight on this process. By helping parents fully understand what it takes to study engineering they can provide greater support to their students and help them seamlessly transition into college life when the time comes."

            "Question 7": "While all three pillars of the SEC mission are vital, engineering awareness resonates with me most. Engineers drive life-changing advancements, yet only 22% of engineering students are female, and this number drops even further in upper-level courses and the workforce, where women make up just 13.7%.\nGrowing up, I never saw engineering as a path for myself because I rarely saw women pursuing it. That lack of representation made it difficult to picture myself in the field. To change this, we must introduce young girls and underprivileged children to engineering early on. Many struggle not due to a lack of potential but a lack of access to support. As a tutor, I\u2019ve seen how one explanation can turn frustration into confidence. By fostering mentorship and increasing exposure to engineering, I hope to create a future where students see engineering as a diverse and inclusive field.",
            "Question 8": "A month before college application apps were due , I made a drastic decision\u2014I switched my intended major from business to engineering. For years, I had been set on business, so those around me thought I was making a mistake. But as I researched colleges and reflected on my future, I realized I wanted a path that would challenge me intellectually and push me to think in new ways.\nMany people questioned my choice, reminding me of my past experiences in business and the uncertainty of switching so late in the process. I listened to their concerns, discussed my reasoning, and considered their advice. However, I ultimately trusted my instincts.\nI\u2019m now studying computer engineering at Texas A&M\u2014a decision I have never regretted. Every day, I am challenged to push beyond what I thought was possible. Engineering equips me with the skills to make a real impact, but I initially never considered it an option because I didn\u2019t see many women in the field. By taking the time to explore and seek guidance, I found a path I truly love. Many don\u2019t do that and as a result, they may miss out on opportunities that could shape their future.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, it would be a STEM Mentorship & Tutoring Program aimed at supporting minority and underprivileged students in the Bryan-College Station area and beyond. This program would connect Texas A&M engineering students with K-12 students, providing both in-person tutoring at local schools and virtual opportunities across Texas through Zoom. By fostering one-on-one connections, the initiative would help students develop confidence in STEM subjects and see engineering as an attainable career path.\nThe primary goal of this initiative would be to increase STEM awareness by exposing students to engineering concepts early on, provide mentorship to guide them academically and professionally, and bridge the accessibility gap in engineering fields.\nMany students struggle in STEM, not due to lack of ability, but because they don\u2019t have the support they need. By offering accessible tutoring and mentorship, SEC can inspire the next generation of engineers, particularly students who may not have previously considered engineering as a career. This initiative would empower future innovators, encourage diversity in STEM, and strengthen SEC\u2019s role in promoting engineering awareness beyond campus."

However, the value that resonates with me most is its commitment to being \"the representative voice of all engineering students.\" I have demonstrated a similar value through my years of involvement in Model United Nations (MUN) from ages 10 to 18, where I traveled globally to participate in conferences. As a delegate I was responsible for representing a country analyzing complex issues, and formulating resolutions that balanced diverse perspectives. This experience sharpened my ability to advocate for others, engage in meaningful discourse, and work toward collective solutions. Qualities that I believe align with the SEC\u2019s mission to amplify the voices of engineering students and hope to apply to enhance fellow engineering student experience at Texas A&M University.",
            "Question 8": "A time where I made a difficult decision was leaving home to study across the globe in the U.S. Not everyone in my family fully supported this choice and at times I questioned whether I was truly ready to leave everything behind and step into the unknown. When I arrived for my first day at Texas A&M, I didn\u2019t know a single person and had never been to not just the campus but the entire state of Texas. The transition was challenging. I had to navigate cultural differences, adapt to a new academic environment, and build a support system from scratch. There were moments of doubt and loneliness, but I reminded myself why I made this decision which was to challenge myself, grow, and embrace new opportunities. I took things one step at a time staying open-minded and pushing through.\nNow, in my fourth semester I can confidently say this decision shaped me in ways I never imagined. I\u2019ve built lifelong friendships, developed resilience, and gained a sense of independence that I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise. Looking back, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Texas A&M has become my home away from home, and the challenges I faced only made me stronger",
            "Question 9": "Building upon my own challenges as an international student, I feel a strong obligation to help others navigate similar transitions. An initiative I would propose is a \"Global Engineers Welcome Program\" aimed at bridging the gap between incoming international students and their comfort within the engineering community and campus life. This program would consist of a social/introductory workshop during the first week of college covering key topics such as academic resources, networking opportunities, cultural adaptation, and tips for success in engineering. Additionally, it would include a buddy system that pairs international students with experienced upperclassmen in engineering who can provide guidance, answer questions, and offer support throughout the semester. The impact of this initiative would be immense. It would create a more inclusive and welcoming environment helping international students build confidence, find a sense of belonging, and integrate more smoothly into Texas A&M\u2019s engineering culture. By fostering early connections and providing essential resources this program would empower students to thrive academically and socially ensuring a strong start to their journey at A&M."

I strongly identify with SEC\u2019s commitment to empowering engineering students through networking, leadership, and outreach.\nI have demonstrated these values through my role as Director of Education for STEAM Bridge, where I organize monthly workshops to expose students to STEM careers. Additionally, as a Student Government Senator, I advocate for student needs and facilitate engagement within my college community. My research on high-functioning autism in STEM, accepted for publication in the American Society of Engineering Education Journal, also reflects my passion for using engineering to create inclusive opportunities.\nThrough these experiences, I have embraced leadership, service, and professional growth, values that align with SEC\u2019s mission. I am eager to contribute by connecting students with valuable resources and fostering a supportive engineering environment at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 8": "During my time as a Student Government Senator, I advocated for increased awareness of student government resources, particularly addressing the inconsistencies in providing menstrual hygiene products across campuses. While many students supported the initiative, some senators and administrators resisted, citing budget constraints and concerns over feasibility.\nI took a strategic approach by gathering student testimonials and data on how this issue affected student well-being. I also researched cost-effective solutions implemented at other colleges and presented them during a senate meeting. Some colleagues remained skeptical, but I persisted by organizing discussions with student organizations and faculty to gain broader support.\nUltimately, the administration agreed to pilot a program increasing accessibility to these resources, and awareness of SGA\u2019s role significantly improved. This experience reinforced my belief in data-driven advocacy and the importance of standing firm on initiatives that benefit the student body.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an Industry Integration Program: a practical course that bridges the gap between class learning and engineering reality through project collaborations with industrial partners. Unlike the different networking opportunities already available, the students would get to solve real-world engineering problems posed by the company they work for; hence, the first line of direct exposure in solving industrially relevant problems. It would be a three-phase program: Industry professionals would present real engineering challenges to the teams of students, students would work in teams to develop a solution that leverages both technical and soft skills, and companies would provide feedback, mentorship, and potential internship opportunities to top performers. This would give students practical experience and the ability to build their resume while expanding their professional network and better preparing them for a career in ways traditional career fairs and networking events cannot. The students would be better equipped to know and work on industry projects while still in school, making SEC a bridge between the students and the engineering workforce, and preparing them for the challenges that await them in the future."

            "Question 7": "Many view Engineering as an exclusive path for bright minds, perhaps due to its prestige and reputed difficulty. I disagree. Engineering is a tool, one that is built with persistent problem-solving and curiosity. During the pandemic, I launched an Instagram page breaking down engineering concepts (like the thermodynamics that allow refrigerators to function) into engaging visuals, reaching thousands of followers. In high school, when choosing topics for competitive speeches, I chose topics that framed engineering as an accessible tool. Specifically, how creativity is the basis of the scientific process, why Edison's thousands of methodical failures exemplify engineering, that curiosity, not genius, propelled humanity from cavemen. The SEC\u2019s focus on awareness aligns with my belief that engineering should not be an exclusive path. By showcasing its accessibility to our world, I hope to prove engineering holds a place for everyone. Awareness isn\u2019t just about spreading knowledge, it's about dismantling barriers.",
            "Question 8": "In team settings, some decisions can define winning and losing. As a member of a karate team competing for the newest Nintendo DS, we faced a critical choice. Should we listen to our instructors and perform the simpler form(sequence of moves), or take on the risk of attempting to learn the harder but flashier form? I was eager to win, perhaps overconfident, I pushed for my teammates to take on the challenge. Begrudgingly our instructor agreed.\nOn the day of the competition, after executing our best repetition of the form yet, we still lost. The winners, though performing simpler forms, moved with synchronicity and precision that was decided to be better than our flashier moves. Guiltily I apologized to my team, for pushing to take on the flashier form. This experience shaped how I approach challenges: now, I value feasibility more and do not let confidence overshadow wisdom gained from experience.",
            "Question 9": "As an aspiring engineer, I sometimes feel lost in the world of knowledge that our professors throw at us. I believe a program that connects students to alumni from A&M in their field of study would foster more purpose in their learning. Specifically, I would connect with departments to identify important courses in their curriculum. From here, we can reach out to alumni working in related fields to show how the concepts taught in these courses are useful to them. We can present this information in various virtual resources. From live virtual panels with alumni to recorded case studies that showcase them utilizing what they learned in these courses. A website can be set up for ease of access which includes Q&A forums, alumni projects, and other examples of how relevant coursework is utilized in various professions.\nThe impact I seek to create is clarity of why students are required to complete certain courses, motivation for students to engage more in coursework, and networking with alumni who are eager to help the next group of graduates transition into their professional careers."

To me, this means setting a strong example and using problem-solving to navigate challenges.\nI have always been politically active as I am passionate about government and civic engagement. I have worked on campaigns and even started a nonprofit organization dedicated to boosting voter turnout. One time while phone banking for a city council race, our team needed to call voters from a specific district, but our database included contacts from the entire city. Using my coding skills, I wrote a Java program to filter contacts by location, making the phone-banking process far more efficient.\nIn that moment, I represented engineering among activists, demonstrating how technical skills can enhance real-world efforts. Through SEC, I want to continue being a voice for engineering students by showcasing how problem-solving and innovation can make a meaningful impact.",
            "Question 8": "In my initiative, Kids Empowering Kids, we raised funds to provide scholarships for students in Senegal to attend university. Most recipients attended a local university with a set tuition, but one year, a winner planned to transfer to a more expensive school that exceeded our scholarship budget.\nThis created a difficult decision. Some team members felt he should cover the remaining cost himself, while I believed we should raise additional funds to fully support him. Recognizing the impact this scholarship could have on his future, I took the initiative to launch another fundraising effort. Despite initial concerns, I led outreach efforts, secured more donations, and successfully covered the remaining tuition.\nThe outcome was deeply fulfilling\u2014not only did we help this student achieve his dreams, but we also strengthened our organization's mission of ensuring financial barriers don\u2019t limit education. This experience reinforced my belief in taking decisive action and advocating for what\u2019s right, even when faced with disagreement.",
            "Question 9": "I\u2019d love to launch an engineering startup incubator event through the SEC. This initiative would give A&M students a platform to pitch startup, research, or project ideas related to engineering. Participants could compete individually or in teams, with judges selecting top winners. While A&M\u2019s Ideas Challenge through the McFerrin Center for Entrepreneurship offers a similar opportunity, it has a broader focus, whereas the SEC would be focusing on engineering related ideas. Additionally, the Ideas Challenge can be quite competitive, as students must apply and be accepted to participate. By hosting an SEC-run startup challenge, we could make participation open to all, reinforcing our mission of spreading engineering awareness while keeping the competition engineering-focused. In the future, we could expand this concept by introducing a mock version for middle and high school students, inspiring younger generations to explore engineering."

In October I had the privilege of representing Texas A&M as a Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities ambassador at their national conference. The program offered us workshops that explained how to strategize and use campus resources to create growth opportunities for students. This experience challenged me to analyze how to use already available resources to bridge them with a new opportunity that engineering students would benefit from. I developed a structed plan for a program that through the SEC, can help guide students to identify career goals, create actionable plans, and take steps to accomplish them. The SEC offers an opportunity to take the vision I have further, by combining the councils resources with my own experience, to advance engineering students professional development and help them obtain their personal and goals.",
            "Question 8": "This past summer I did research with a team, and we worked on implementing an object detection program for a robot. We were struggling to find a method to convert pixel coordinates to 3D real world units. The lab\u2019s primary investigator (PI) insisted on using a specific method, but when we tested her approach, we found that it was time-consuming, the conversions were inaccurate, and didn\u2019t deliver the expected results. We suggested to the PI to let us test other methods we had read about, but she initially dismissed it and insisted on her idea. However, we had an interview/demo coming up with Washington post. Me and the team weren\u2019t content with the current results, but they told me just go along with what the PI instructed us. I wasn\u2019t conformed so, despite the pressure, I began to investigate other alternatives and performed several trials which led me to discover a method that showed a significant improvement in accuracy and consistency. I presented the data of the trials to the PI, and after seeing the improvement, she agreed to implement this new method in our project. I learned not to settle for conformity and to challenge ideas to improve outcomes.",
            "Question 9": "The SEC offers valuable resources like the career fair, industry panels, and workshops that expose A&M engineering students to connections and career opportunities, that help set goals and visions. However, there is a gap between students and their goals. It is the absence of a career path plan. Many students have clear end goals, but don\u2019t know how to get there. I know many qualified peers that struggle to advance their career because they can\u2019t secure an internship or research position due to the lack of a clear and actionable plan that could make them competitive candidates. I propose the Pathways to Engineering Success Program (PESP). It is a program that through the SEC, provides a structured milestone-based plan to support students alongside all the amazing resources already offered. Each student would create a template that serves as a guide that breaks down long-term career aspirations into attainable milestones. For example, if a student\u2019s goal is to secure an internship in a specific field by the end of their sophomore year, the PESP would help them identify relevant organizations, projects, certificated and skills to prepare them to become more confident and successful candidates within the engineering community at A&M."

I have always been someone to collaborate with others and serve as a \u201cteam-player\u201d to many so it is deeply rooted in me to help others reach their potential. In high school I was a part of the robotics team, and unfortunately we had a limited number of members who were experienced in areas such as 3D design (AutoCAD). As a result, I took it upon myself to learn and help the other members understand the software. This experience not only helped our team be a lot more efficient and successful in the creation of our robot by advancing each of the members\u2019 understanding of a crucial aspect of the design process, but also created opportunities for these members to go on the software themselves and design and tangibly construct their own ideas.",
            "Question 8": "My senior year of high school, I had a friend who exhibited a concerning toxic behavior. Many were aware of this issue, however, no one attempted to confront him about it because of his known arrogance and potential conflict to arise. Although most advised against it, I decided that I could not live with myself if I never took action to confront him. As a result, for the sake of my friend\u2019s future and putting our friendship on the line for his own well-being, I respectfully confronted him in a civil manner. By explaining to him the consequences of his actions on others and emphasizing that he could leave whenever he would like, I successfully achieved what many had thought was impossible and had a productive conversation. Although the outcome was not as immediate as I would have liked it to be, as the year progressed I began to see change and by the time we graduated I was beyond proud of my decision. From this experience, I learned that sometimes sacrificing your own peace for what you believe is right can be one of the hardest decisions to make but yet can also be one of the most rewarding.",
            "Question 9": "As there are many underclassmen here at A&M in engineering who are lost or possibly intimidated by the various steps they must take to reach success, guidance from upperclassmen remains one of the most valuable resources for them. As a freshman myself, this is a message I strongly relate to, and that is why I would create a program that would pair upperclassmen with underclassmen based on certain traits to help alleviate their nerves and provide guidance. The benefit of this program is that it would positively impact both sides. Upperclassmen would be able to promote a reassuring voice to aspiring engineers as well as strengthen their ability to lead and mentor, which would help reflect a positive image of the engineering community as a whole. Similarly, underclassmen would be able to benefit by advancing their academic and professional careers in ways previously unknown to them all while increasing their overall awareness of the engineering world. Thus, this program would not only do an excellent job at promoting the three pillars of the SEC\u2019s mission statement but it would also help foster a more supportive and successful environment for the engineers of tomorrow."

Through my life, I have many opportunities to be a representative voice of my communities. During high school, I was vice president of the boarding student body and had the opportunity to lead and serve. I make sure everybody's opinion and idea is well respected and consider all of them as possible positive implementation for the community. At Texas A&M, during my freshman year, I lead a small team at ACC to develop an app. What truly unique about my team is that they composed of all freshmen with little coding experience. But I am willing to lead and learn together with my team.",
            "Question 8": "My hardest decision I have to make was to cut off one department within my Athena App project at Aggie Coding Club. I was the project manager of Athena App at the time, and I originally divided my group into 4 departments, handling 4 distinct tasks: Front-End, Back-End, AI integrated, and Market R&A. Because of the heavy time constraint of the deadline projects, I have to cut off AI integration, which is a very significant part that people like. This caused a minor conflict at first, but I have a strategy to satisfy my members. I reallocated the people in AI integrated department into their second most-wanted choice in the original survey that they take; this has two goals: boosting the speed of an production and making sure everybody feels they are still apart. Furthermore, I divided the AI integrated into a sub-department that can be integrated directly into the other 3 departments so that people within my AI department don't feel their work has been wasted and they can continue to pursue what they wanted originally when joining. Overall, this is the most optimal solution I have that ensures everyone is valued and feel respects for their contribution.",
            "Question 9": "I would create a platform both digitally and in person that will help freshman students know more about opportunities engineering has to offer. During my freshman year, I observed that many students around me are often confused and don't know much about events that are ongoing or even what major they want. Because of this, I want to make a platform that includes all engineering events on and off campus that is tailored to each student's desired major. This platform will also include an insight and resume matching algorithms to even classify which major a student should choose when they are confused about what to ETAM into. In the case they know their desired major, then the platform can provide what action could take to be ready for the major, and possible internships stem from the respective major. The concept targets two main aspects, inclusitivity and future insight, which can be massively beneficial to any students and set them up for success. Most of us are very intelligent, but we lack a clear path or a mentor, and I strive to make that possible for any one of us just by a single click or a single question."

            "Question 7": "Increasing engineering awareness through programs and events resonates with me.Engineering is more than just technical knowledge, it\u2019s a way of thinking that helps solve complex problems.By promoting engineering awareness, we give people the tools to approach challenges logically, think critically, and innovate solutions.I have seen the power of this perspective through robotics and clubs and it reflected on my real life.In high school, I worked with younger students to help them understand not just how to build and program robots,but how to break down problems into smaller parts, test solutions, and iterate. By joining SEC,I want to help bring this mindset to more students.Events, workshops, and outreach programs can show people that engineering is not just about equations it\u2019s about understanding problems and finding solutions in any situation.Learning to think like an engineer is a skill that benefits everyone,and I believe SEC plays a vital role in sharing that perspective.",
            "Question 8": "During a robotics competition, our team had to decide whether to use our self operating code in a match. It worked well sometimes but failed unpredictably. Some teammates wanted to disable it and rely only on manual control, but I believed the risk was worth it since our highest scores came from the automated system. As the lead programmer, I had to make the call. I listened to everyone\u2019s concerns and proposed a compromise: we would refine the code with last-minute testing and add a failsafe to switch to manual control if needed. When the match started, our automated code worked perfectly, giving us an early lead and helping us win. The team was relieved, and even those who had opposed the decision admitted it was the right choice. This experience taught me how to make tough decisions by weighing risks, listening to my team, and standing by a choice when the data supports it.",
            "Question 9": "I would create the SEC Engineering Outreach Initiative which would connect SEC engineering students with high school students from underserved communities to help them learn about STEM through mentorship and hands-on projects. This program would give students real engineering experience and inspire them to explore careers in the field. A key part of the program would be hands-on engineering projects, where college students mentor high school teams to build things like drones, robots, or renewable energy models. These projects would lead to an annual SEC competition, where students could test their designs and solve real-world problems. To give students a better understanding of engineering careers, the program would also include field trips to companies, helping them see how engineers work in the real world. Another important part of SEOI would be a scholarship and internship program, which would connect top students with financial support and job opportunities at engineering companies. At the same time, SEC engineering students would gain leadership and mentoring experience. This program would help more students get involved in STEM, improve SEC\u2019s reputation in engineering, and create strong connections with companies. By inspiring the next generation of engineers, SEOI would make a lasting difference in students\u2019 lives."

I have always been passionate about helping others progress and find what they enjoy. In high school, I would help other students organize a degree plan and find majors they are interested in. Since I went to an early college high school, my classmates and I had to plan out college classes to obtain our associates degree. I helped one of my friends realize that he wanted to study mechanical engineering, helped him structure a degree plan that would allow him to quickly get his masters once in college, and helped him find a college that fit him. I hope to continue helping people thrive through the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "A time I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with was choosing to attend Collegiate Academy. Collegiate Academy was the early college high school I graduated from. Some of my family members and friends were worried that I would end up missing out on the high school experience, and that many of the friends I had made would not be going there. To handle the situation, I had to take time to think about myself and analyze my goals. I knew that I wanted to attend a university after high school, but I was unsure if I'd have all the funding needed. I also knew that taking dual credit classes would be good exposure to the college environment and way of mind. I decided to go to Collegiate, and it was the most impactful choice I've ever made. Not only did I graduate with 75 college credit hours, I made many new friends, was on the state champion team for UIL Social Studies, and learned strategies to be successful in college.",
            "Question 9": "A project idea I have for SEC would be a Shark Tank style competition in which engineering students can learn how to design and market products. This could be done, potentially, in collaboration with the May's Business School. This would help connect students from different majors/schools and allow them to unite and develop skills that they might not learn from their normal classes. Teams of students would come up with and test a product design, and once they have their final product they would pitch to either other students, or industry representatives. This initiative would allow students to form new ideas and connect those ideas to real world industries. Engineering students would receive business expertise and business students would be able to learn more about product development. Combined, this would help students learn many important skills, such as collaboration through disciplines, problem solving, and networking to help them prepare for successful careers."

Too often, I feel that students in the College of Engineering focus solely on their GPA, overlooking the immense value of meaningful connections. I believe that professional growth isn\u2019t just about a number next to your name, it\u2019s about building relationships that open doors and create opportunities. This semester, I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to say \u201cyes\u201d to organizations, societies, and groups that strengthen my network. By doing so, I\u2019ve experienced firsthand the impact of collaboration and community, which are values that the SEC actively promotes among engineers across our university. Being part of this organization would give me a platform to contribute to this mission, further fueling my ability and commitment to fostering a culture of professional growth and connection.",
            "Question 8": "Being in a leadership position means making tough decisions, even when not everyone agrees. As a member of my fraternity\u2019s Philanthropy Committee, I faced one of those moments when I had to cancel our softball tournament, a key event in our annual Fireman\u2019s Challenge philanthropy week. The decision was necessary to reallocate funds toward fixing our house\u2019s AC system. Many were frustrated with this since this specific event was a tradition, but I knew prioritizing essential improvements would benefit our chapter more. Despite pushback, I stood by the decision and worked with others to find a solution. We organized a Meet & Greet at our house, which was a more affordable option that still raised money through food sales. This experience taught me that leadership isn\u2019t about pleasing everyone, it\u2019s about making the right call and adapting when things don\u2019t go as planned. If given the chance to join SEC, I\u2019d bring that same problem-solving mindset and ability to adapt.",
            "Question 9": "If I could introduce a new initiative for the Student Engineers\u2019 Council, it would focus on strengthening the organization\u2019s social media and website presence. A lot of people don\u2019t realize how important an engaging and professional online presence is. Platforms like Instagram are the first and sometimes only impression outsiders get towards an organization. A well-maintained digital presence can help the SEC reach more students and make a stronger positive impact. As the Public Relations Chair for Pi Kappa Alpha at Texas A&M, I\u2019ve learned how to build and maintain an online brand that grabs attention while staying professional. Using tools like Canva and Photoshop, I\u2019ve created content that keeps people engaged and informed. I want to bring these skills to SEC by creating things like calendar story posts, event recaps, and enhancing the website\u2019s appearance. I believe this would not only expand the SEC\u2019s reach to more students but also increase exposure to companies who are looking to connect with engineering talent at Texas A&M. I\u2019m confident in my ability to help create content that highlights events, opportunities, and the overall impact of the organization in a way that reaches more students."

SEC\u2019s mission to foster the professional advancement of engineering students resonates with me because I believe true leadership is about paving the way for others to surpass you. I want to ensure students have access to the same resources and peer guidance that helped me.\nAs an ECEN Student Ambassador, I volunteer at Aggieland and DI Saturday, presenting departmental opportunities, demonstrating lab concepts, and hosting Q&A panels. As a Peer Teacher for ENGR 102, I assisted freshmen in programming, providing resources like Replit and LeetCode, which I wish I had known earlier.\nJoining the Engineering Development Committee would allow me to expand these efforts through Industry Night Presentations and DI Saturdays, potentially incorporating lab demos from my Aggieland Saturday experience.",
            "Question 8": "As President of the International Student Association (ISA), I faced a tough decision when our advisor suggested implementing membership dues. While I understood the need for funding, I strongly believed financial barriers could discourage international students from joining\u2014a concern shared by many members.\nRather than outright rejecting the idea, I acknowledged the funding challenges but emphasized that ISA\u2019s core mission was building a supportive community, not generating revenue. I presented alternative fundraising strategies such as partnerships with local businesses. During this time, I decided to reach out to off-campus apartments in College Station since they have a huge international community. I secured up to $3000 for our annual I-week event, which is significantly larger than what dues would have got us.\nThrough open dialogue and data-driven reasoning, I convinced the leadership team to forego membership dues, ensuring accessibility for all students. Looking back, it ended up being successful for both pirates as our sponsors thanked us for being able to have a broader audience by surveying international students at our events on their living preferences. Meanwhile, we met our financial objectives. This decision strengthened ISA\u2019s engagement and gave us the resources to serve our community more meaningfully.",
            "Question 9": "One of the most valuable resources an engineering student can have is direct access to industry professionals who have walked the same path before them. To strengthen SEC\u2019s mission of fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students, I would establish an Alumni Mentorship Program, where engineering students can apply to be paired up with an SEC alumni from their respective major.\nThrough a similar program in the Corps, I\u2019ve witnessed how personal connections with professionals can shape career decisions, improve communication skills, and provide clarity on industry expectations\u2014guidance that is often difficult to obtain through coursework alone. Regular check-ins\u2014whether through virtual meetings, emails, or in-person meetups\u2014would encourage meaningful interactions, allowing students to seek advice on coursework, and career planning and potentially get job referrals.\nBy implementing this initiative, SEC would create a lasting network that benefits both students and alumni. Students would gain a real-world perspective on their major, while alumni would have the opportunity to give back to the next generation of Aggie engineers. This program would ensure that engineering students at Texas A&M are better prepared, more connected, and more confident as they transition from academics to the professional world."

            "Question 8": "When I worked at a bakery cafe, I encountered a difficult situation where a regular customer was upset that her discount coupon did not work for a drink. I tried to help her by clarifying the conditions, but unfortunately, she misinterpreted and thought that I was just refusing to let her use the coupon. Although the requirements for the coupon were beyond my control, I still felt responsible for the situation and took her words personally. Some of my coworkers suggested giving her a free drink or unauthorized discount to quickly resolve the issue, saying that our manager would probably approve, while others, including myself, were hesitant to make such decisions without permission. This situation reminded me of my bad habit of trying to figure out problems alone instead of asking for help from someone, so I went to my manager for help, and he ended up giving her a free drink to resolve the situation. This experience reinforced in me that asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but an eager willingness to learn and improve.",

            "Question 8": "During the Spring 2020 semester, I was working on a project for General Motors with a small team of about five to six people. As the project progressed, we faced a critical decision regarding the implementation of a key feature, generating price/quote modules for customers. Some team members favored a quick, cost-effective solution, while others, including myself, believed a more robust, scalable approach was necessary for long-term success.\nDespite pushback and the upcoming deadline, I presented data and potential risks associated with the shortcut. To ensure a fair decision-making process, I called a meeting where everyone could voice their concerns and we weighed the trade-offs together. Ultimately, after considering all viewpoints, we opted for the scalable solution.\nWhile some initially resisted, the outcome validated our choice. The final implementation was more efficient, reducing future technical debt and aligning with GM\u2019s long-term objectives. While there were risks with coming up with a more robust solution, this experience reinforced the importance of balancing short-term constraints with long-term value and using data-driven reasoning to navigate tough decisions.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for the SEC, it would be a Blockchain/Crypto Compliance Lab. The objective would be to take help students take a closer look at this highly volatile market in a safe environment under proper supervision and guidance. This initiative would require collaborating with crypto developers and regulatory experts to enforce guidelines that protect investors. Along with this, the initiative would require financial disclosures for crypto exchanges to prevent incidents like FTX. Finally, the initiative would need an Investor Protection section to help students be able to recognize fake coins and scams to avoid loss. The reason I believe that a Cryptocurrency initiative would be useful for the SEC is because it is a major part of the future as it starts the shift from how we store money to digital assets. Cryptocurrency, while dangerous, has many benefits such as efficiency, easier access, and security. Blockchain technology also has borderless transactions and lower fees making it a very important subject that people should be knowledgable about. It is pretty clear that digital assets and blockchain will be the financial technological revolution."

During my time, I got to serve on the worship team with 5 other people and serve the people on campus. Through that opportunity I was able to attend community service events and help promote campus-wide bible studies and gatherings every week. I had the opportunity to use a passion of mine--my Christian faith--to serve other people through various events and opportunities and teams such as EnVision and Philanthropy would be an amazing opportunity to continue encouraging and serving the younger generation.",
            "Question 8": "Last semester, I made a very difficult decision in leaving the Corps of Cadets in order to focus on my academics and my faith, even though it meant sacrificing the relationships I had made and future relationships I could've had. This was met by lots of backlash from upperclassmen and my peers that did not want me to leave, but I understood what I needed to do to make the progress that I wanted to see. Before making the hard decision, I spent several weeks praying and thinking about it and what I would do if I chose the route of leaving. I brought up my situation with several upperclassmen that I trusted and asked for genuine honesty in their opinions. While none of them wanted me to leave, they thankfully understood my reasoning and encouraged me to do what was best for my future. Eventually, I called a meeting with my peers and told them my situation and that I had made a decision to leave. While several were sad to see me go, the way I handled the situation allowed me to keep several of those relationships intact and maintain the respect that we had all fostered together.",
            "Question 9": "During my early years of high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career or even what I wanted to study in college. This is a situation that I know lots of high school students are in and while they have a lot of time to figure it out, having a helping hand would be very useful. If I could create a new initiative or project for SEC, I would create a day for incoming college students coming to Texas A&M or any other university called \"Transition day\". Transition day would be a day where Texas A&M University engineers from different disciplines would go to various high schools around the area and have a career day-esque format with high school students being able to attend informationals about different engineering disciplines led by current college engineers. This would include getting to speak to college engineers directly and learn more about different majors and a college student's honest perspective. I believe this would have a great impact on wondering high school students and would help give clarity and direction to students who potentially feel lost in the world of major and career selection."

            "Question 7": "What resonates with me most about SEC is its role as a uniting voice for the engineers at A&M. Having gone through ETAM once before transferring majors again from Civil to Electrical Engineering, I know how mentally taxing it is to rebuild a social circle - and how important that social circle is. For me, it\u2019s how I avoid burnout. Personally, I try to embody this connection through being outgoing and engaging with everyone, even those I may never see again. Life itself gains character when you get to know the character of its people.\nAll that considered, providing engineering students with a social backbone should be prioritized, especially as almost everyone here faces a social transition after ETAM. This is what I hope to bring to the College of Engineering through SEC; as students struggle with classes, internships, and growth, to be the hand that reaches out to them.",
            "Question 8": "When I first decided to transfer from Civil to Electrical Engineering, I got a lot of pushback from my family, who pays for much of my tuition. Honestly, I don't blame them; the transition between majors forced me to proceed with two very different paths in mind: preparing for electrical courses and the transferring process while also keeping up with my Civil Engineering classes in case the transfer didn't pan out.\nI realized pretty quickly that the legitimacy of my decision hinged on the outcome of the transfer - and I wouldn't find out for a semester; so, when I told my family, I focused on being transparent with them. I explained why I wanted to switch majors and backed it up with an outline of how I'd proceed academically while pursuing the transfer. Every grade, advisor meeting, and insight into my future was shared. While they didn't stop worrying overnight, the trust we had through open communication eased their doubts over time, allowing for a stress-free, comforting relationship during a stressful semester.\nThrough respecting their concerns while staying firm in my resolve, I earned their support, and am now proudly in the Electrical Engineering program here at A&M.",
            "Question 9": "The College of Engineering could really benefit from an event that exposes engineering students to non-traditional career paths, not often highlighted by the career fairs and industry speakers brought in. While corporate engineering roles dominate discussions, academia, entrepreneurship, and consulting are things my peers and I know little of despite the College of Engineering\u2019s efforts.\nSEC could host a panel discussion featuring engineers that have pursued these non-traditional career paths. Workshops and small-group rotations with presenters could also take place, which would be designed to give students a more engaging experience. While these kinds of events exist within the College of Engineering, thus far they have been relatively small, scattered, and not united under one initiative.\nBetween majoring in Civil Engineering and Electrical, I\u2019ve seen how students often lack direction toward these career paths. Industries like RF or Structural Engineering are talked about but walled off to only graduate students\u2014and even while sophomore students may want to pursue these paths, they know little about graduate school or how to start a business. It\u2019s this type of direction that this program would aim to provide, and what I feel would be most appreciated by the College of Engineering."

            "Question 7": "The Student Engineers' Council (SEC) aims to serve as the representative voice for engineering students, increasing engineering awareness, and fostering professional advancement within the College of Engineering. The commitment to fostering professional advancement deeply resonates with me. During my tenure in cross country and track, I consistently woke up at 5AM to run three miles daily. This discipline instilled a relentless drive to prove that I could stand on my own two feet and self improve every day. Similarly, in my academic pursuits, I have engaged in different opportunities such as career fairs, workshops, and hands-on experiences to not only expand my skill set but to also sharpen my abilities. This alignment with SEC's mission motivates me to contribute in an active role to promote the professional growth of my peers. Regardless of where they stand with their abilities and careers, I want to push people forward into becoming contributors.",
            "Question 8": "On Sundays in the summer, the youth fellowship had basketball games for a couple of hours. Unfortunately, one of those Sundays was questionable due to Hurricane Beryl potentially causing floods. The appropriate measure of action would have been to cancel the games due to the disaster. However, the coordinating team received a lot of backlash from many players for considering the suspension of the games. What was on my mind the most was the fear of being trapped by the floods if the rains got worse in the Missouri area. I knew there were other players telling me that it was the right call to cancel games for the safety of people amidst the hurricane. We ended up canceling the games that day and I got a lot of angry calls because of it but some people also get to stay safe from the floods. I knew that no matter what decision we made that day, people would not be happy. I prioritized the safety and well being of not only players but also parents and spectators. This experience taught me that no matter what decision you cannot make everyone happy even if it is a calculated decision.",
            "Question 9": "I propose the \"Engineering Wellness Program\", an initiative aimed at promoting physical and mental well-being among engineering students. The priority should be to not only recognize the hardships of engineering students with the rigorous demands of engineering but also to take initiative in providing workshops and routines to deal with stress, depression, and create a supportive environment that allows students to succeed in their endeavors. This includes yoga sessions, runs, counseling, group studies, and time-management skills. Another project that I would promote for the SEC is suicide awareness. Over at the University of Houston, there were two student suicides in the Agnes Harold Hall which pushed the university to close it at one point. As disturbing as it may be to think about while reading this, that is the harsh reality set in front of universities. Engineering is not for the faint hearted and failure is inevitable at different points not just in the classroom but in life as well. The SEC should take initiative to prioritize this issue with the proposals mentioned earlier and install mental wellness checks that can be most accessible and seen by the public eye. Doing so will foster professional and personal growth."

Through a program called \u201cPastabots Junior,\u201d I introduced STEM topics to elementary school students. These \u201cJunior Pastabots\u201d were excited to balance popsicle sticks and foam blocks to create a tower or build a bridge out of toothpicks to support a load. But, their enthusiasm extended to learning the physical reasons as to why the things that they were doing were happening. Seeing the younger students get excited about engineering concepts was immensely gratifying, and their curiosity to understand more about the physical world aligns perfectly with SEC\u2019s mission to increase engineering awareness.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I worked a weekend job as a dishwasher and bagger at a bagel shop for a few months. The job paid well, but the work was not for me. My parents urged me to get this job; consequently, I knew they would be unhappy with me if I decided to quit without consulting them. Regardless, I felt like I was in the wrong place, so I quit. And, as I anticipated, my parents were discontent, to say the least, with my choice.\nI handled the situation by soon finding a new job at a gym, as a member services associate. This new position taught me skills in customer service and financial reporting\u2014qualities I did not gain as a dishwasher.\nI took a leap that resulted in a gain in skills and confidence, proving that sometimes the harder decision is the right one. While my parents were initially upset, they eventually saw how much happier and more fulfilled I was in my new role. Over time, they even praised my initiative and growth.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, I would create an undergraduate mentorship/advising program. The objective would be helping undergraduate engineering students feel at home when they arrive at A&M and/or are placed in their discipline. Exclusive to first and second year students, the program will select upperclassmen volunteers who will individually coordinate with new students seeking guidance and support. Freshman would be able to schedule appointments with a mentor studying towards their preferred engineering degree, while sophomores would be able to schedule appointments with mentors in their same discipline. These appointments would be less formal than a traditional advising appointment, allowing new students a more comfortable encounter. They also have the potential to be more informative, as the upperclassmen mentors\u2019 personal experiences are more impactful than the mere theory that academic advisors offer. The mentors could suggest professors and classes to take as well as organizations to get involved in\u2014insight that advisors cannot give. This interaction would encourage new students academically and socially, likely getting them on their feet more quickly and more effectively."

            "Question 7": "Professional advancement resonates the most with me because I am a person who likes to grow and learn. Going to events like the career fair and being able to interact with different recruiters helped me develop my professional skills. Professional advancement is very important because it helps similar students like me grow their careers and get potential internships and jobs in the future. Doing this benefits students as they are ready to be a part of the real engineering world and also helps them be great candidates for competitive jobs. Also, the different workshops such as networking events and guest speakers helped build my technical skills and my confidence when talking to recruiters or other professionals. As a member of SEC, I want to make sure that every engineer will have this professional development and succeed in life after college.",
            "Question 8": "One difficult decision I had to make was to choose my college. My entire family wanted me to choose UTD where I received scholarship and I was closer to home but I wanted to go to A&M. Being an only child, I've valued my parent's thoughts so going against them made me quite guilty and upset. However, I was able to realize ignoring their feelings would create more tension so I instead took time to see the situation from their perspective which was worrying about the finances and distance. This understanding helped me communicate my viewpoint on the situation in an empathetic way as I was able to show them the positive sides of coming to A&M which were the better opportunities and professional network. By helping them see my perception and me understanding their perspective I was able to convince them that A&M was the best decision for me to make. In today's world, everyone is so busy only perceiving situations through their eyes, which is why I think it is important to try and understand the world from other people's perspectives during difficult decisions.",
            "Question 9": "A new project that I\u2019d love to make is a company culture tour program. While the SEC already hosts guest speakers and professional development workshops, I believe students would benefit from visiting various companies in person to see what their work-life balance and culture are like. Just like how high school students tour campuses to see if a university aligns with their values, college students should also be able to explore different work environments before trying to commit to an internship or job. The objective of this program is to give students insight into the company norms and the compatibility with their own career goals. Some potential outcomes include students being able to decide whether or not they truly fit into a company\u2019s culture, which reduces workplace dissatisfaction. Many students accept positions at big tech companies but they eventually discover that the company\u2019s culture doesn\u2019t match their personal interests. By making these tours, the SEC can help empower Aggies to find the perfect environment in which they can grow their career."

I think its important for kids and teens to have easy access to trying prospective future careers, or even just extracurricular activities, out so that they can learn and make the right decision for them. I admire how SEC holds many opportunities for kids to learn about STEM pre-college like Envision and REACH. I have demonstrated a similar value when I helped over the summer teach a kids tennis camp. This camp had kids ranging from kindergarten to middle school and it was my job as a coach to introduce them and show them how fun tennis can be in just a couple day camp. The campers loved their time at camp and many were already talking about signing up for tennis lessons. This showed me the impact these introductive activities can have.",
            "Question 8": "During my time on my high school tennis team, I was constantly getting changed doubles partners. Preference on what/who we played with were typically done by seniority, but I found as a senior, and one of the players that had been on varsity the longest, my preferences were still not being listened to. I was constantly being changed doubles partners and was put in singles in the first spring tournament when singles was not a preference I had given the coach. During previous years when I was being changed around a lot, I'd stayed silent and just dealt with it. But when it came to the fact it was my last year, and that I was being put with doubles partners whose attitude problems made me feel belittled, I finally had the courage to speak up. I spoke with my coach about my thoughts on the matter, and while I know he was hoping to finish the season with the pairings he had just put together, he listened and respected my opinion. I finished the season playing with a doubles partner I worked great with and learned a valuable lesson about speaking up and making my voice heard.",
            "Question 9": "Similar to the activities done under SEC's student wellness focus, my idea would be to host more non-engineering related, but equally as accomplishing activities like a fun-run/race or craft workshops. I think giving engineering students something of this nature would be great because it can be easy to get completely immersed in just studying and school, but its important to have balance in order to not get burnt out. Activities like these would be a opportunity for students to take time and focus on, or maybe create new, hobbies and spend time with engineering friends outside of the academics focused environment."

As a high school student, I saw firsthand the challenges my peers face in breaking into STEM fields, from lack of representation to limited access to mentorship and resources. As a result, throughout my undergraduate program at UC San Diego I participated extensively in mentorship opportunities to support young women entering STEM fields. Most recently, I served as a mentor and judge for an AI hackathon in San Francisco, in which high school students from low income communities developed AI-based solutions for improving financial literacy. Additionally, through the Society of Women Engineers, I mentored two freshman students, helping them with professional development and navigating campus life and coursework. These experiences have shown me the strong importance of mentorship, outreach events, and providing a support system to help young students navigate the field of engineering.",
            "Question 8": "While leading a research project on Chicago Police Department policies, my team was invited by Towards Data Science to publish our findings, with an emphasis on timely political issues such as police misconduct and systemic bias. However, one team member felt that this framing was too politically charged and preferred not to be associated with it due to personal beliefs. Initially, we agreed as a team to remove his contributions and proceed without him, but given his significant role in our project\u2019s success, I wanted to find a solution that honored both his concerns and our collective work.\nTo handle the conflict, I reached out to a professor of ethics in data science at UCSD. With his guidance, me and the team member revised the paper to focus on objective, data-driven insights rather than political framing while still maintaining the importance of our findings. In the following team meeting, I pitched this revised paper to my team members along with our original work, and with a team vote, we ultimately decided to go with the new version. The publication editor was impressed with our new direction, and the article was published as a featured piece on their front page.",
            "Question 9": "I would create Engineering Xchange, a 1:1 mentorship program designed to give high school students an inside look at life as an engineering student at Texas A&M. The program would pair each high school participant with an engineering student who they can \u201cshadow\u201d through a typical day, including attending classes, visiting labs and organization meetings, and working on assignments and other work. This would provide students with a realistic understanding of what engineering coursework and student life entails, allowing them to make informed decisions about their future. Through Engineering Xchange, participants would also have the opportunity to connect with faculty, student organizations, and campus resources, helping them build a support network for when they eventually pursue their own college journey. The mentorship aspect would also include structured Q&A sessions, where students can ask questions about college applications, the engineering curriculum, and career paths in the field."

I strongly believe that making sure people's concerns are heard and acted upon is an important part of being a citizen in this country, and I also believe that the same can be applied to students. In 2022, I volunteered for a Texas governor campaign, where I spoke with members of my community to inform them about their voting rights, spreading awareness about issues that impact all of us as Texas citizens. Besides that, I've always been encouraging people to speak up and speak out about broken policies that need change.

            "Question 8": "In my senior year, my friends and I went on a trip to New Mexico to go skiing. The drive was about 12 hours, so we all took turns driving. About 9 hours into the drive (it was dark outside), all of us took a turn driving and we were all visibly tired. The difficult decision I had to make was when my friend and I suggested to pull over in a parking lot and rest for a bit. The other members of the group were not too fond of the idea, and mentioned that the remaining drive was only 3 hours, suggesting that we \"thug it out.\" Since we were driving my car, I made the unpopular decision to stop in a rest area, despite the ensuing argument. After 4 hours, we all woke up and my friends admitted that the decision I made was the right choice. We all came to agree that if we continued driving, someone could have fallen asleep at the wheel which would have potential fatal consequences. This experience taught me that no matter what anyone tells you, you must always trust your intuition and prioritize safety in these situations.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative, I would establish the Aggie Infrastructure initiative, which would allow students to actively participate in the university's physical future. This initiative would include a competition in which all engineers who attend Texas A&M will have the opportunity to solve an infrastructure problem/design a specific part of campus to potentially be adopted by university leadership. Some areas of focus could be water drainage, transportation efficiency, sustainable energy, and creating weather-resistant infrastructure. Student-run teams would identify any real campus issues, and will use their engineering knowledge to plan and execute their solutions. This competition would be directly judged by stakeholders of the competition, namely the people in charge of implementing large-scale infrastructure changes at Texas A&M. This would give students hands-on experience in the real-world applications of their respective majors, and it would benefit the university as a whole by bringing fresh new perspectives brought by the students themselves to fruition."

When eighth grade came around, I joined a Robotics competition called Seaperch for the free food, and instantly fell in love with engineering. My team advanced to the international tournament, and our school flew us out to compete. Before that, I never imagined I could be as passionate about something as I was about video games.\nIn my senior year of high school I became a Seaperch ambassador for my school district where I encouraged other students to participate in this competition as they may find a life-long passion - similar to how I did. SEC\u2019s mission of engineering awareness resonates the most with me as I want to be part of an organization that helps students uncover interests they never knew they had, similar to things such as SEC\u2019s EnVision program.",
            "Question 8": "This past summer, I volunteered with the Jeeyar Educational Trust (a NPO) for the inauguration of the Statue of Union, the third tallest statue in America. As the head of the technology and hardware team, I ensured we had all the necessary equipment, including a massive 30-by-20-foot LED screen at the front. I also coordinated with various companies to equip our 80-by-200-foot tent with properly positioned speakers for optimal sound and for a price that fit our budget.\nAfter setup, I proposed reallocating part of our speaker budget to add an extra LED screen at the tent\u2019s midpoint, ensuring even those at the back had a clear view. The team was split 50/50 on this decision, so I made the executive call to cut a few speakers in favor of the additional screen after letting my team know I will take full responsibility for any mishaps. On the final day of the three-day inauguration, 2,000 attendees arrived. Without the extra screen, nearly half would have struggled to see the ceremony. Fortunately, we resolved the reduced speaker issue by boosting the main system\u2019s volume on the first day. This decision ultimately provided a better experience for attendees without exceeding our budget.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for the SEC, I would launch a program focused on expanding job and internship opportunities for international students by partnering exclusively with companies willing to sponsor work visas. Many talented students at TAMU face significant struggles in securing employment due to their immigration status, despite being some of the most skilled and hardworking individuals on campus.\nThis initiative would have three key objectives:\nIncrease Access to Opportunities: By collaborating with companies open to visa sponsorship, we ensure that international students have equal access to career opportunities rather than being restricted by legal barriers.\nSupport Diversity and Innovation: The workforce benefits from a diverse range of perspectives and expertise. Ensuring that these students have a pathway to employment strengthens industries by bringing in global talent.\nReduce Stress and Uncertainty: Immigration challenges create immense pressure for students trying to secure their future. This initiative would help reduce that burden by opening up more opportunities.\nBy fostering inclusivity and breaking down barriers, this project would reinforce the school of engineering\u2019s commitment to innovation and excellence, ensuring that all Aggies - regardless of immigration status - can thrive and contribute to the global workforce."

In 2022, I volunteered for a Texas governor campaign, where I spoke with members of my community to inform them about their voting rights, spreading awareness about issues that impact all of us as Texas citizens. Besides that, I've always been encouraging people to speak up and speak out about broken policies that need change. As engineering students, it's on us to make sure Texas A&M's engineering program can continue to be a nationally-respected institution by using our collective voices. Change doesn't happen in silence.",
            "Question 8": "In my senior year, my friends and I went on a trip to New Mexico to go skiing. The drive was about 12 hours, so we all took turns driving. About 9 hours into the drive (it was dark outside), all of us took a turn driving and we were all visibly tired. The difficult decision I had to make was when my friend and I suggested to pull over in a parking lot and rest for a bit. The other members of the group were not too fond of the idea, and mentioned that the remaining drive was only 3 hours, suggesting that we \"thug it out.\" Since we were driving my car, I made the unpopular decision to stop in a rest area, despite the ensuing argument. After 4 hours, we all woke up and my friends admitted that the decision I made was the right choice. We all came to agree that if we continued driving, someone could have fallen asleep at the wheel which would have potential fatal consequences. This experience taught me that no matter what anyone tells you, you must always trust your intuition and prioritize safety in these situations.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative, I would establish the Aggie Infrastructure initiative, which would allow students to actively participate in the university's physical future. This initiative would include a competition in which all engineers who attend Texas A&M will have the opportunity to solve an infrastructure problem/design a specific part of campus to potentially be adopted by university leadership. Some areas of focus could be water drainage, transportation efficiency, sustainable energy, and creating weather-resistant infrastructure. Student-run teams would identify any real campus issues, and will use their engineering knowledge to plan and execute their solutions. This competition would be directly judged by stakeholders of the competition, namely the people in charge of implementing large-scale infrastructure changes at Texas A&M. This would give students hands-on experience in the real-world applications of their respective majors, and it would benefit the university as a whole by bringing fresh new perspectives brought by the students themselves to fruition."

As a first-generation with no siblings, I experienced directly the difficulty of navigating your professional career. The journey felt like navigating through darkness, as I encountered obstacles and uncertainties without further guidance. This meant that I had to light up my own path. Today, I use my first-hand experiences and knowledge to support my younger cousins that are currently in a similar position that I was a few years ago. I offer college advice, share experiences, and encourage their efforts towards pursuing their goals. I hope to strengthen the foundation and platform that students look towards when feeling lost in the natural intimidating environment of professionalism. I strive to work alongside the Development and contribute to that sense of guiding light to the engineering community as they explore their own paths.",
            "Question 8": "From the moment memories were capable of forming, my lifelong goal was to become a doctor. After first-handedly participating in clinical experiences, I realized that my aspirations and passions were shortly lived. This transition period reoriented my professional goals from medicine to engineering, however, the joyous feeling of making a positive impact on someone's life never left. However, my family viewed the world through traditional Asian values that prioritize careers in medicine. They were resistant to my new found passion and continued to push me in the direction of becoming a doctor. Although my family initially vocalized their disapproval, I remained persistent by communicating my reasoning to them and showcasing how engineering would allow me to make an impact in a different aspect. I continued to express the underlying excitement through my creative thinking and problem-solving skills that would allow me to contribute towards society. Over time, my family began to understand and support my dedication towards the field of engineering, as they prioritized my happiness the most. This decision has allowed me to grow into a more confident and determined individual, prepared to make an impact through engineering.",
            "Question 9": "An initiative for the College of Engineering at Texas A&M would be a speaker series that featured industry professionals, researchers, and other innovative minds that discuss the latest advancements and findings within various fields of engineering. For example, some current events relevant today could include Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Health Tech, etc. Each event would aim to highlight different engineering disciplines and their current applications within a real world environment. The main objective of the speaker series would be to expose students to the latest engineering news in-person to create a sense of innovation and creativity within our community of engineers. By directly listening to the industry professionals at the forefront of these innovations, students would gain a deeper appreciation of their work within the classroom and how it translates to impactful, real-world innovations. In addition, the speaker series will allow for students to align their academic goals towards the industry they may be interested in, similar to DI Saturday and Industry Night. This new sought-after sense of community that the speaker series creates across all engineering students will motivate the next generation of innovators and leaders across engineering as a whole."

            "Question 7": "What resonates the most with me about SEC's mission is its dedication to serving students in the college of engineering. I have been actively involved in service through BAPS, a worldwide socio-spiritual organization dedicated to spirituality and community service. Since 9th grade, I have dedicated every weekend to volunteering and running assemblies in Houston for children and teenagers. Along side this, my regional role at BAPS involves organizing large-scale events, mentoring younger members and helping to create a community. One of my most impactful events was planning two large retreats for the Southwest Region held in Dallas for over 900 delegates this past summer, where I learned and developed the values of leadership, teamwork and creating opportunities for others to grow. Service has always been a part of my life and I would love to bring that same passion to SEC, helping uplift the engineering community at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 8": "While our regional team was organizing a large retreat during the summer, we had to decide how the schedule would be structured, especially due to the limited time we had while having lots of activities planned. I suggested to prioritize interactive discussions and personal development sessions and programs over additional recreational time, hoping they would have more of a lasting impact on the delegates. However, some team members felt that delegates may want more free time to relax and have downtime. In order to address this, we engaged in open discussions on our calls, where everyone shared their perspective on the situation. I listened carefully, taking into account what everyone had to say, and in the end, we acknowledged the importance of balance. I proposed a new schedule that took into account both sides\u2014reducing some discussion and session time to allow for multiple structured breaks. This ensured that delegates didn't feel too overwhelmed nor was the purpose of the retreat defeated. In the end, the event was a success and it reinforced my belief in making thoughtful decisions, communicating with all team members, and finding solutions that take into account all feedback.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative as a SEC Officer, it would be to start a mentorship program for students in the college of engineering, designed to connect underclassmen with upperclassmen and industry professionals. This sort of initiative would be immensely helpful to students as it would provide guidance on academic stability, internship opportunities, career development and helping students make more informed decisions throughout their early college journey. With this mentorship program, students can foster one-on-one relationships, creating a strong network between Aggies where underclassmen can feel confident to ask questions and seek advice from upperclassmen. With this program, upperclassmen can also develop their leadership and communication skills while mentoring others. Referencing myself, I am a freshman looking to make a career in Software Engineering so, having another student or new-grad Software Engineer mentor me, would be very helpful in being able to achieve my goals. This initiative by the SEC would have a strong impact on the community at Texas A&M, serving students with a strong network between Aggie Engineers to find support in their academic and professional goals and making the transition into college a lot easier."

            "Question 7": "The \u2018engineering awareness\u2019 aspect of SEC\u2019s mission resonates with me because my choice of engineering was a direct result of the inspiring mentorship of engineers when I interned at NASA. Also, as a high schooler, I mentored elementary school kids, when I taught them the basics of robotics. I listened to their design ideas, helped them assemble parts, and then explained what each part did. I encouraged them to try and solve the problems by themselves, then with their peers, then come to me. With this approach, the kids were able to understand how the design process works from beginning to end. Increasing engineering awareness by the right mentors plays a big role in helping kids help figure out what they like. By introducing them to engineering now, they will be able to explore their interests in STEM in their future, and as I did, perhaps pursue engineering.",
            "Question 8": "As the director of my high school robotics program, I encountered many scenarios where I was required to make a difficult decision. During our first competition, our robot completely failed, the chassis was unsteady, the arms were completely broken, and multiple screws were missing. Most of the team wanted to just make small fixes to make it work, while I and a few others strongly believed that we needed to start over. As the director, I decided to rebuild the robot. We had already spent many hours working on our robots and I knew this decision would double those hours. I had to convince everyone that it would help us learn and build something much better. For the next three weeks, we worked long hours to completely redesign, build, and test our robot. We improved everything, our chassis was now stable, the arms were fixed, and came up with a game strategy to maximize points. By the next competition, the new and improved robot performed way better, and even beat highly ranked teams. From this experience, I learned that we were successful because I took the risk of starting over, which helped the team to learn and adapt to change.",
            "Question 9": "I would introduce \u201cSuccess Through Engineering and Problem Solving\u201d (STEP), an outreach program designed to spark the interest of younger engineers. SEC members would visit local middle and high schools monthly, to introduce students to engineering, problem solving, and creativity. Although STEP\u2019s objective is like the EnVision Scholars conference, it will allow SEC members and the school students regular opportunities to interact. The range of activities will depend on the age group. For middle schoolers, we give them the \u201cStraw Tower Challenge\u201d, to build the tallest structure using only straws and tape to learn basic engineering fundamentals, like the importance of a strong foundation and load distribution. For high school, we could cater activities that could give them an idea of a potential major to pursue. For example, to explain the complex chemical engineering concepts of thermodynamics and heat transfer, they would make ice cream in a bag, where salt lowers the freezing point of ice, allowing heat transfer to easily freeze the mixture. Catering to both age groups will bring out their problem-solving skills and introduce them to hard concepts early on. This initiative will help the younger students, while also giving SEC members mentoring and leadership opportunities."

There was another member who I knew had the potential to do very well at the conference. After discussing it with my board and sponsor, they all told me to go, saying I had \"earned the trip.\" Ultimately, I chose the other student to go instead of myself. Since I wouldn\u2019t be going, I still wanted to support my team during the final competition as both a friend and a leader. I helped them create research files to use during their debates.

I enjoy being a mentor and learning from those that I have to lead; for example, as a boy scout, I was a troop guide--just a position that guides the younger scouts and helps their patrols while still allowing them to learn through their ideas-- I would have meetings with my patrol before campouts where we would help them plan meals and such, but instead of letting the loudest in the group over take the menu planning I would help to give the quieter kids a platform to present themselves through and have input in what they were a part of.",
            "Question 8": "A difficult decision that I had to make was choosing to go to private school over staying in public school: with public school, I felt that I wasn't being pushed enough but it was where all my friends were however the private school was much more rigorous but I wouldn't have any going there. I ended up choosing to go to private school for high school, and it was the best decision I ever made. While I didn't think this at first, mainly due to not having friends, as I grew out and started to be integrated more into the culture of the school and found myself throughout my time I ended up finding it to be the best choice I made. I ended up finding my love for rugby as well as some great friends--friends that were arguably better than my public school friends-- but also found enjoyment in school again as I was being pushed to be the greatest student (and athlete) I could be every single day. While my public school friends still don't get why I chose private school, taking my headfirst dive into a different experience was the greatest gift I could have asked for.",
            "Question 9": "If I were to create a new initiative for the SEC I would create a professional writing and speaking workshop. This is due to the stereotype of engineers having weaker professional speaking and writing skills and having workshops to help engineers strengthen these skills would be far more advantageous than just having one or two English classes, which might not make this an emphasis throughout the class, during your time in the A&M engineering program. The objectives of this project would be:\n1. Strengthen the professional writing skills of students through writing emails, working on project outlines, writing reports on teams throughout projects, how to create presentations and other professional writing skills\n2. Strengthen the professional public speaking skills of students through mock interviews, mock project presentations, presenting information to an engineering project team, how to properly present ideas to investors, and how to give an elevator pitch.\nThese professional speaking and writing workshops could be held weekly or every two weeks to help students gain vital professional speaking, presenting, and writing skills. The potential impact of these workshops would be an increase in students receiving better internships, better jobs, and students getting higher paying jobs with their skills."

            "Question 8": "The most difficult decision that caused conflict within my family was going to college out of state. I'm from Saint Louis, Missouri, and my support system believed staying closer to home would be safer and more affordable. They even questioned if I was ready to move so far away. After carefully weighing the pros and cons, I decided to attend Texas A&M and communicated with my family why it was the best choice for my future. To address their concerns, I shared my plans for managing expenses and reassured them that I would stay connected and maintain our relationship. Convincing myself was equally challenging. As the oldest sibling, I felt selfish for leaving my younger siblings behind for self growth opportunities. However, I realized that pursuing my dreams sets a positive example for them. Leaving my comfort zone was tough, but it has shaped who I am today. I\u2019ve strengthened my independence and built meaningful personal and professional relationships that contribute to my success.

            "Question 8": "During my senior year of the spring semester of high school, I participated in an engineering course that included a team rocketry competition. The biggest challenge was agreeing on a functional design for the fins of the rocket. Based on the simulations I ran of my design, I believed that our rocket should have two sets of fins to increase drag and ensure stability so that we could reach a target altitude, while others desired one, larger, set of fins.\nThe team was split in half between the two options, and no one was making a decision. This took a toll on our progress as we were approaching a deadline for the competition. Because we were locked almost in a stand-still, I consulted an experienced mentor, who advised the one fin set option. I made the decision to pursue this option, which still upset some of the members of my team. Although some members were unhappy with the decision, we were able to move forward with the competition and complete the rocket design as a team. This experience taught me the importance of balancing team collaboration with well informed, impartial decision making.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new project for SEC, it would match upperclassmen or graduate students with undergraduate freshmen. The Entry to a Major process can be difficult to navigate, as it can be hard to tell what a major fully entails.\nConnecting with upperclassmen who know about the specific coursework in each major has been beneficial in my decision to pursue Interdisciplinary Engineering. I came into Texas A&M having already known some of these upperclassmen, but I imagine how it may be difficult to find someone to talk to if you do not already have such connections. For this reason, I propose that SEC could offer a service that matches up freshmen with upperclassmen/graduate student mentors that are in a major that they are interested in or want to know more about.\nThe potential impact of this program would be a significant improvement in the clarity and confidence in freshmen as they approach the ETAM process. This program could also foster a greater sense of community in the College of Engineering as a whole. Freshmen would feel supported, while mentors would be able to develop leadership skills and find a sense of purpose in pouring into freshmen."

The planning took several months, but it was incredibly gratifying to see the event come together. The Girl Scouts all seemed to enjoy it, and I loved getting to see them enjoy the activities we'd planned. Also through SWE, I volunteered to lead a Society Competition at SEC's fall Envision Conference. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it solidified how much my values align with SEC's.",
            "Question 8": "Last semester, I had the opportunity to serve as the Society of Women Engineers's (SWE's) Socials Chair. In previous years, socials were organized completely by the chairs, without a committee, but last year, my co-chair and I wanted to start one. We had both first gotten involved in SWE through committees, and even though we believed we could easily organize the events without the assistance of a committee, we felt strongly about giving others the experience and opportunity to get involved in SWE. The vice president in charge of our program was opposed to it, as she didn't want us to get in over our heads, and previous social chars had never had a committee. However, once we explained how strongly we felt about it, she allowed us to start our committee. It was intimidating to go against the advise of a more experienced person, but the committee was, in my opinion, a success. The first social we organized had almost 4 times the amount of attendees as social in previous semesters. But most importantly, 2 out of the 10 committee members have gone on to be chairs this semester, and I am so proud of them and their growth.",
            "Question 9": "SEC already has a lot of initiatives that I think are really valuable, and I believe that quality over quantity is super important. However, if I could create a new project for SEC, I think that something different from what is currently being done within SEC would be a study group program. The program's objective would be to connect underclassmen students with study groups for specific majors and an upperclassman or two in that same major who could provide advice and class help. Besides the obvious benefit of the additional help with difficult classes, the participants would also gain community and mentorship. Engineering, especially at A&M, can be a competitive environment, and being surrounded by people who are working to achieve the same goals can be incredibly motivating and beneficial. Furthermore, the upperclassmen would gain leadership experience, and communication skills from having to explain things differently. I also truly believe that teaching others is one of the best ways to solidify your knowledge. In my personal experience, helping friends with classes I've taken previously is the best way to brush up on my understanding. I believe that all participants would benefit from this program."

            "Question 7": "The part of SEC\u2019s mission statement that resonates most with me is increasing engineering awareness because growing up, no one really knew what an engineer was. Even in school career days, kids dressed up as doctors or police officers, and our image of an \u201cengineer\u201d at the time was just someone who works with circuits or fixes computers. In our elementary \u201cWhen I Grow Up\u201d projects, none of us wrote about wanting to be engineers one day because no one knew what it entailed. This is why I think increasing engineering awareness is the most impactful mission of SEC. Kids and teenagers need to know more about how vast of a field engineering is, and that it\u2019s more than just what they assume it is. It\u2019s about community impact and how each sector of engineering works to improve quality of life.",
            "Question 8": "In eighth grade, my middle school counselor presented me with the opportunity to attend an International Baccalaureate school, which offered a rigorous academic environment. Having already attended an IB school for two years in elementary school, I knew I wanted to take this opportunity as it aligned with my future goals. I had also been a part of an amazing friend group after recently moving, and I knew this decision entailed leaving my close friends. A lot of my friends thought the program wasn\u2019t worth it and didn\u2019t understand why I wanted to make such a change, but I knew being in the IB program would benefit me and would support my long-term goals. Although it was academically demanding and overwhelming at first, I soon became glad I chose this path for myself because it prepared me for academic rigor, helped me gain valuable skills like leadership and organization, and allowed me to meet new people. Throughout high school, I still cared about my past friendships and made the effort to stay connected, and in the end, I\u2019m proud of myself for making the decision to prioritize my future while maintaining valuable relationships.",
            "Question 9": "One idea for a project I have is for SEC to partner with Engineers Without Borders to send engineering students on local engineering service projects to apply their engineering skills and knowledge in real-world challenges. This way, students could prepare for their own careers while helping communities who don\u2019t have access to better technology and resources. This idea also complies with SEC\u2019s mission to promote professional development while building Texas A&M\u2019s reputation as a leader in engineering education and outreach.\nThe program\u2019s objectives would be to advance infrastructure, provide safe and clean water, and use sustainable energy for communities that need it. Another objective would be to give an opportunity for engineering students to learn, collaborate, and solve problems, putting their skills to use. The program would have a great impact for everyone, whether it be the students or the people of these communities who would have a better quality of life."

As I gained more experience in STEM through tutoring, coding competitions, and cybersecurity internships, I still found myself being one of the only girls in these spaces. While I didn\u2019t mind, I felt a strong desire to grow the voice of women in STEM. To do this, I created a group of girls to compete in a local hackathon. Despite feeling intimidated by the experienced competitors, especially the men, we pushed forward and tackled the competition head-on, choosing to focus on our skills and teamwork rather than gender. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of advocating for those whose voices aren\u2019t always heard, which is why SEC\u2019s mission, the representative voice of engineers, resonates the most with me. It\u2019s about creating opportunities for everyone to be heard.",
            "Question 8": "During my senior year of high school, I applied to 20 colleges, unsure where I wanted to spend the next four years. What I did know was that I wanted to challenge myself and step outside my comfort zone. As I submitted applications, rejections began to pile up. Each letter I opened left me feeling more deflated: \"We regret to inform you...\" slowly chipped away at my confidence. I began doubting my efforts and feeling like all my hard work had been for nothing. Then, I received an acceptance letter from my dream school, which had been on my mind throughout the application process. I was overjoyed to be admitted off the waitlist. But shortly after, I learned that my family couldn't afford to send me there. Faced with the choice of significant debt or attending a more affordable option, I struggled. Seeking advice from friends and mentors, many encouraged me to pursue my dream school despite the financial strain. In the end, though, I realized the financial burden would weigh more heavily on me and my parents. I chose to attend Texas A&M, where I now feel confident in my decision and excited about my future.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an initiative called \u201cGirls in Engineering Exploration\u201d (GEE), inspired by programs like EnVision Scholars, but specifically designed to encourage high school girls to explore engineering. The program would offer workshops, hands-on activities, and career-focused experiences in a comfortable, welcoming environment. The goal is to inspire and empower young women by providing them with the opportunity to explore different engineering disciplines, build confidence, and connect with female engineering students and professionals who can serve as mentors. While the initiative would primarily focus on girls, it would foster an inclusive atmosphere, ensuring all students feel supported and encouraged to learn from each other. By offering engaging, interactive projects and real-world experiences, GEE would help girls overcome the intimidation often felt in male-dominated STEM spaces and inspire them to pursue engineering. The potential impact of this initiative includes increasing the confidence of young women in STEM, promoting diversity in engineering, and creating a supportive community that empowers them to continue their educational journey and enter the field. Ultimately, this initiative would serve as a stepping stone, helping girls see themselves as engineers and feel empowered to pursue their passions in STEM."

Within my school, I offered free calculus and physics tutoring to people, and as president of Mu Alpha Theta I organized SAT/ACT study days. I've continued these habits at A&M, always making sure to help those around me succeed in class through peer mentoring.

            "Question 8": "In my senior year of high school, I competed in the International Public Policy Forum(IPPF), which is a written and oral debate competition with students from over 30 countries competing every year. There were four others on my team, and to work quickly, we individually would research and write individual sections and then combine them to one essay. As team captain, I was responsible holding meetings, and making the final decision to cut/edit the essay, which led to many conflicts over whose content should be cut. At the beginning, I tried to make the decision mostly alone, and present it to my team as a nonnegotiable to avoid conflicts. I realized that this simply creates suppressed resentment in between team members, lowering the quality of future essays. Additionally, I was flawed in many of my decisions. I found that instead of completely avoiding conflict, creating a collaborative, respectful environment to compare perspectives, and present there own unique solutions. I inevitably had to make the same difficult decision, and some members still disagreed, but the team was more harmonious. This led to our essays being much higher quality, leading to us finishing top 8 in the competition.",
            "Question 9": "I would want to create more initiatives for SEC to impact the Brazos county education system. Although envision scholars already impacts high schoolers, I think we can do more to give back to the community that supports our university as a whole. As a large group of engineers, we can organize large tutoring days for entire districts, helping them with nationally standardized tests, like the ACT/SAT, or offer services directly in schools that need more tutors, having members sign up for shifts. Additionally, SEC could create digital events for students to join and find someone that can help them with an assignment or give them a different perspective on a concept. The impact may seem marginal, but over time, we could make a large difference in the success of Brazos county education. To clearly define its objectives, the organization can use standardized test scores as a benchmark, or directly contact schools to monitor specifically students who have attended SEC tutoring versus those who haven't, allowing us to see the magnitude of our impact on a given student. If we can significantly improve students outcomes, both in the short and long term, this would be a successful and beneficial program."

The type of students who make up the College of Engineering is just as broad as the engineering field itself, therefore it\u2019s essential for students to feel seen as they invest in their future. Through my experience, I\u2019ve learned that navigating through this degree is much more enjoyable and manageable with the right support system. Hence why I believe investing in the SEC positively impacts the experience of students. I most recently implemented this value as a peer mentor for the ESBP cohort & ensuring they\u2019re exactly where they belong. I served as a link between instructor and student, making it comfortable for them to talk to me about any difficulties they might be experiencing and communicating to my instructor what activities or resources would be most helpful to implement in class.",
            "Question 8": "Last semester I had a ChemE lab which was teamwork-based and required lots of compromises to be successful. Our final grade was based on the creation of a 3D-model rocket and code simulating a launch. Due to our limited skills with Solidworks, our design didn\u2019t quite turn out as we expected as it lacked concavity. Therefore the group decided to try different methods for the wings to fit our base. I decided to use a burner to bend the wing which was highly risky since the angle could end up being too sharp and break the wing, leading a member to disagree. However with a tight deadline, we didn\u2019t have time to print out new pieces and with \u00be members on board, we had to follow my method. Although we had previously disagreed, we still worked together to ensure the best result and the performance of our rocket was the second highest in a class with 24 groups. If we hadn\u2019t taken the risk to put our wings on the line, we probably wouldn\u2019t have anything to present. I learned that sometimes you have to defend what you believe will work and just try to make with what you have.",
            "Question 9": "When I think of how students can have a more impactful interaction with SEC, I think of activities in which students can easily participate in as they walk by Zach and feel like it\u2019s a break from class. I think further developments in the external section would be helpful, especially in the special events section. A great initiative to get more engineering students involved would be to host more random acts of kindness such as setting up a compliment booth in which members can give students encouraging words or simple compliments, or have the student who just received a compliment give the next person in line a compliment and form a chain reaction. Another simple but effective activity would be having a drawing with chalk activity in the E-quad. This can encourage student to write positive notes and just share their creativity with others. Although all these activities sound fairly simple, I believe if I were to see that students are putting in to make my day better it would make me smile. Sometimes all we need is a break from classes and what better way to do so than by interacting with fellow Aggie engineers."

            "Question 8": "During a hackathon, my team and I had to modify our project\u2019s scope due to time constraints. Half of us wanted to continue on our original path, incorporating a difficult component into our product (which we lacked prior experience in). The other half wanted to downsize the scope of the project as a whole, which would\u2019ve led to us implementing a simpler element that we also hadn\u2019t worked with before. As we each spent the beginnings of our 24-hour period researching our project systems, we made little progress towards deciding on a final strategy, so I decided to form a productive end to our indecision by advocating for the component that could be practically implemented in our remaining time (the easier one). I felt that this course was the wiser option, since we\u2019d be more likely to have at least something in our project rather than nothing. I had also hoped to include the difficult component in our project, but for the sake of our team\u2019s success with regards to our time and resources, I felt it best to sacrifice complexity for a completed project. In the end, we barely made the deadline with the simpler component successfully implemented.",

This project\u2019s objective would be to help underprivileged students gain more experience with different types of engineering disciplines. Ideally, this project would ignite a liking for different types of engineering in young students in order to help them see that engineering could be a very viable path for people of all demographics. We could accomplish this aim with outreach to youth centers, after-school programs, and other such organizations, where either members or volunteers for these events could showcase exciting technologies that they\u2019ve worked with/learned about, or walk students through interactive and engaging lessons to learn simple and fun concepts learned through the different engineering disciplines. This type of project would have a great impact on increasing engineering awareness among the youth, and would greatly impact children from groups that have a harder time breaking into the engineering world by directly showing them the incredible potential behind the different disciplines."

Along with this the endeavors that I have began as part of the Aggie Research Program have also helped me to hone my skills and view the many different fields that engineering can influence such as using AI to grow better crops, or aid in construction. Finally my experiences in developing my own step tracking app has taught me the challenges and problems solving skills, as well as the perseverance needed to be an engineer. With this experience I hope to aid in the growth of professional development through SEC.",

Around then I realized that our ideas were stagnating, and we would most likely not make it as far with the current idea that we had. I made the suggestion that we change our current project and redesign the project even better. While one of my team members agreed the others were skeptical in restarting. I knew that it would take some convincing, but I was confident that we had more potential as a team. I made a list of pros and cons and also explained the potential ceiling that we would reach with our current model. After an in depth discussion we finally decided to change our idea, although with my teammates suggestions we took some of the ideas from the original app. With the new design we were able to place 11th out of 60 teams which is higher than we would have placed with the original design. With this experience I was able to learn the true abilities of teamwork. I was also able to discover how to become more successful through collaboration.",

This event could be a one to two day convention or meet and greet where students can meet with graduate students who have been successful in their fields and get help or tips on how to become more successful both during their time as an undergrad student, and their time afterwards. The goals of the event could be to teach students about different career and higher education choices that were previously unknown, and get hands on experience with the workforce and job hunting. The impact of this event would be an increase in successful graduates through the undergraduate engineering, and more overall success in A&M. This could also as a by product help to connect undergrad and graduate students which helps to make connections and gives more clarity and communication for students going into the future as they leave college."

            "Question 8": "As an out-of-state student, the decision to come to Texas A&M was one that was extremely difficult.\nWhen it came time for my senior year, the decision to pick a college loomed large and throughout my time in education, and being from California, it only seemed natural that I would attend a UC school within the area where I grew up. However, when the idea of going to Texas A&M for aerospace came to fruition, I almost instantly believed that this was the place for me.\nMy mom, family, and friends all had mixed opinions on going so far for college, but I assured them that this was the right decision for me, and I acted on it. I gave very detail-oriented reasons why this school could contribute so much to my education, and did enough research to convince people that I was making a mature and calculated decision.\nThe result was that of being accepted into an amazing university with thousands of opportunities, and through the SEC, I want to make sure to leave an impact on our campus the way it has already impacted me.",
            "Question 9": "Throughout the many projects of the SEC, a new initiative that would be highly beneficial would be that of a General Engineering Career Fair. This would be an event under the Engineering Development team where one or two people can reach out to smaller scale recruiters and friendly faces who could welcome incoming freshmen into the world of networking.\nDue to the fact that many recruiters at the career fair want engineers who are already in their majors, many new students become highly anxious to attend the career fair until their sophomore or even junior year. With the GECF, recruiters would know that they are dealing with people who don\u2019t have experience, and can cater their information into developing prospects for the future instead of expecting already complete engineers. This process can even include ideas like recruiters assigning students projects that are similar to the ones at an internship without actually providing an internship, allowing them to put small-scale yet relevant work on their resume.\nUltimately, this would uplift first semester students into understanding the culture of socializing with recruiters and give them the confidence to walk into real career fairs and gain internships and opportunities of their own."

Being the General Secretary of the College of Engineering Committee at Covenant University in 2018\u20132019, I helped staff and students communicate so student issues could be presented to administration, showing the SEC's commitment to representing engineering students as the official voice for engineering students.\nBesides being the financial director for my student department association, the Association of Electrical and Information Engineering Students, I planned career symposium series to help students grow professionally and learn about engineering fields. These projects support SEC professional development.\nMoreover, my participation as a member of the Project One Million Souls Charity Organization shows my forever commitment to community service and outreach, which fits the SEC's goal of raising engineering awareness and so improving society.",
            "Question 8": "As the Financial Director of Covenant University's Association of Electrical and Information Engineering Students, I had made a difficult choice regarding our committee's proposed major academic and professional development event. Financial restrictions forced us to decide between several smaller seminars or a single, highly influential event featuring a well-known industry guest speaker.Although many students chose the seminars for their practical approach, I thought that hiring an industry speaker would have long-term advantages.\nAfter some committee members objected, I discussed the financial ramifications, offered a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, and included interested parties to guarantee openness. I also inquired about a single, orderly conference among industry experts and faculty advisers. It was approved. I advised recording and distributing event materials to a larger audience to offset sponsorships and expenses, so easing concerns. Following much discussion, the committee decided on the seminar.\nThe result was clearly favorable. Inviting industry professionals, recruiters and a sizeable audience, the event gave students insightful analysis, networking chances and even internship-training offers.

The SEC Student Handbook will be a strategic effort to assist Texas A&M undergraduate and graduate engineering students. The guide will negotiate the difficulties accompanied with advanced studies and steer students toward a guaranteed smooth transition in the engineering college.\nApart from the classroom, the handbook will be a career roadmap including internships, research opportunities and networking routes via SEC events and career fairs. It will introduce to graduate and undergraduate students professional organizations, leadership development initiatives, and SEC projects promoting career advancement and teamwork. The handbook will feature some past student success stories from businesses to inspire readers to participate actively in SEC activities.\nBy arming students at all levels with well-organized direction and industry-oriented insights, my proposal will increase student retention, engagement and career readiness. Its digital and print accessibility guarantees inclusivity for students from many backgrounds, thus it will be a useful tool. By means of this concept, SEC will strengthen its role as a guide and supporter of engineering students.

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC\u2019s mission that resonates with me the most is the commitment to providing students with opportunities for professional development. While I was in high school, I competed in business competitions such as FBLA and collegiate DECA. Through these competitions, I was able to present solutions to case scenarios and improve my communication skills by talking to the event judges.\nI am currently involved in an undergraduate research team at Texas A&M, where we engage in discussions regarding important machine learning papers and research presented by fellow students in the lab. These discussions have widened my knowledge in this field and have given me a path of interest for my career.\nI hope to be able to not only continue to develop professionally through SEC\u2019s events but also work to provide fellow engineering students with opportunities for them to grow.",
            "Question 8": "While volunteering for ACEing Autism, a nonprofit that teaches tennis to children and adults with autism, I was privileged to work with an adult named Shawn. Shawn\u2019s hearing was also profoundly impaired, which I was originally unaware of prior to working with him.\nWhen working with Shawn, he wouldn\u2019t pay attention to instructions I provided him. Mistaking him for simply being uncooperative, I inquired of the program director who informed me of his hearing disability. The program director, along with other volunteers, informed me that due to his impaired hearing, he would not listen to any instructions given by volunteers so it would be best to move forward.\nUsing this information, I determined a method other than verbally communicating to reach him. I did not want any person to feel left out of the activities. Modeling a visual learning approach worked best with Shawn. Rather than instructing Shawn to \u201cHit the ball,\u201d I demonstrated the action of hitting the tennis ball with the racket. Applying this approach to other tasks, I noticed Shawn\u2019s enthusiasm towards learning steadily increased.\nHelping Shawn progress taught me about adapting my teaching style based on the individual and the importance of effective communication.",
            "Question 9": "One new project I would create for the SEC would be an Engineering Pen Pals Program. With this project, students at Texas A&M can connect virtually with middle/high school students in rural areas of Texas and provide mentorship. I believe this would be important as several students in Texas might be passionate about pursuing engineering but may not have access to resources that will allow them to pursue their interests.\nObjectives:\n-Mentor students in various disciplines of engineering through personalized guidance\n-Provide students with insights on college course curriculum, undergraduate research opportunities in fields of interest, and personal projects\nPotential Impact:\n-Allows college students to offer meaningful input that can help others achieve their goals and aspirations\n-Fosters growth for both mentors and mentees (mentors experience growth in teaching others and learning how to adapt teaching styles to fit their students best, mentees expand their knowledge on varying engineering disciplines and demonstrate their growth through projects and opportunities)"

            "Question 7": "Within the SEC, roundness is more than a physical characteristic. The SEC is a continuously expanding circle growing to embrace engineers with different life experiences and values, creating a community providing freedom in self expression and exploration. As an aspiring SEC member, I would love to help strengthen TAMU\u2019s interconnected community of engineers, non-engineers, and the College Station community through the SEC\u2019s engineering awareness initiative.\nDuring my Memorial Hermann clinical engineering internship, I realized that I am drawn to opportunities to uplift others. After not being able to help the many Spanish-speaking families searching for their loved ones in the hospital, I learned simple Spanish medical terms to be better equipped to support those struggling to overcome the language barrier. I am a strong advocate of supporting those around me so they can thrive, and I am eager to contribute to the SEC\u2019s mission of empowering engineers and future innovators.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I was president of a Best Buddies chapter, a global nonprofit dedicated to ending the isolation of individuals with disabilities. I partnered with HEB and the Contemporary Arts Museum to organize community events like pumpkin painting and cookie decorating.\nFewer students participated in these events than were in class due to lack of transportation and parent communication. Many parents were not updated on what their children were accomplishing or struggling with due to digital illiteracy and language barriers. I believe it is crucial for all students to have a strong support system in and outside of school, so I wanted to regularly call parents with updates, send out communication in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, and hold biweekly awareness presentations about developmental disabilities.\nAt first, my officer team was hesitant about this plan, intimidated by the level of commitment needed to establish a strong parent communication system while promoting diversity within our school. To make this plan more approachable, I created committees to address each goal. My plan eventually came to fruition, and my officer team and I were incredibly proud of how we had not only strengthened parent-student relationships but also cultivated a more inclusive campus environment.",
            "Question 9": "My love for photography began as a habit of stealing my parents\u2019 phones to photograph everything in sight. This passion developed into an affinity for mixed media, through which I create artwork from unconventional materials like fishing line and transparent film, and later led to my interest in biomedical engineering. While searching for inspiration, I came across Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist who sees colors as sound frequencies created by a sensor implanted in his head. After realizing that art and science can intermingle, I became intrigued by how engineering-devised solutions can improve individuals lives significantly.\nI feel that most students believe that the worlds of engineering and humanities are meant to be kept apart, but I believe all students should have the chance to experience both, as the blending of artistry and scientific knowledge fosters well-rounded problem solving and innovation. Similar to how the SEC offers free succulents and therapy dog petting during Wellness Week, we should plan a week of art enrichment that includes events like 3D pen sculpting and catapulting paint-covered marshmallows to create a collaborative mural. Art-infused engineering events would not only serve as effective stress relievers but also experiences that broaden students\u2019 perspectives."

I hope to be a part of the Internal Division focusing on relations and administration. So far at A&M, I have aimed to be the ideal representative of an Aggie. I have encouraged my peers, worked hard in classes, all while upholding honor. I feel the best way to continue this is to represent A&M's Student Engineers' Council. My dedication to the SEC will be focused on maintaining a reliant community, making sure everyone feels included, and helping people find others with similar goals and aspirations. With my short time in college thus far, I have prioritized these ideals and would love the opportunity to continue in a more organized and professional environment.",
            "Question 8": "One of the hardest decisions I had to make was whether to attend Texas A&M University while being out of state from Pennsylvania. Growing up in the same city my whole life, the friends I had since kindergarten were the same friends I completed high school with. With the rest of my family living in India, besides my brother and parents, the friends I had in PA were more like family. Most of them remained in PA and chose to attend a university there. Many people, including my parents at first, encouraged me to stay close to home.\nMaybe that is true, that initially I would have enjoyed choosing a college close by where all my friends will be at as well. However, I believe choosing Texas A&M was the right choice for me. Not only is A&M more challenging academically, but the initial transition to the new environment is also more difficult than anything in-state. With knowing almost no one here, I had to learn to get out of my comfort zone and figure things out on my own. This transition allowed me to become more independent and self-sufficient, preparing myself for the real world better than any other university.",
            "Question 9": "An initiative I would like to implement for the SEC is to prioritize welcoming out of state/country students and make them feel at home here in Aggieland. As an out of state student from Pennsylvania, I feel this could be very beneficial and impactful for students not from Texas. Though the engineering school at TAMU is prestigious, many people, like myself at first, were hesitant due to it being a whole new environment and community.\nA great way to implement this to host an event targeting out of state/country students and have past members of the SEC available to guide and connect with them. This would allow people coming from similarly unique backgrounds to socialize and potentially have questions answered by SEC members. New students to the area would be able to build meaningful relationships and find their social circle comfortably in a controlled environment where they may not feel as tense. This is also a great way for the SEC to meet students from various backgrounds who have interest in the SEC. Getting over the initial college stress with making friends and finding your people will allow for an efficient and effective transition to college."

Looking at all my friends who are also engineers, I understand the importance of working together and helping each other achieve our professional goals.\nIn my life, I resonate with this mission as I try to advance my own career. I regularly attend SEC events such as resume and LinkedIn workshops, company chats and socials, and career fairs. By doing all these things, I hope to advance my career through connections, networking, and internships. While doing it for myself, I also help my friends. I actively create spreadsheets with tons of information, pass them around to other engineering students, and help them improve their resumes the best I can.",
            "Question 8": "During one of the first hackathons that I competed in, we were trying to create a receipt scanner. We initially started the project as a web application, but during a small break, I saw that many people were doing a web application. This made me want to switch gears and, instead, work on an IOS application, which would be significantly more complex to implement.\nDespite its complexity, I had to convince my teammates to switch to the IOS application. I showed my team how to use Swift and Xcode and split the work among them so that we could still finish the project on time. By taking the lead, I was able to show that it was possible to complete the project and that there were many benefits to it.\nIn the end, switching to IOS development was the strategically smarter idea. Our decision paid off, and we achieved 7th out of 57 teams at TAMUHack. This experience helped me realize that I need to take calculated risks and fight for my ideas. It also showed me how communication and perseverance are key in group projects.",
            "Question 9": "One idea that many students would benefit from is a multidisciplinary program between other disciplines, such as business, healthcare, law, and arts. Many students get secluded from real-world applications and get stuck in the world of engineering and would benefit from seeing how engineering would fit into these other disciplines and how we can work together with these other students.\nSome ways this could be possible is to have professionals from other industries give workshops on how engineering has helped them throughout their careers and how they have worked with engineers. This would help show the intersections in their paths and give students a better perspective on the engineering world and its usefulness. Another way would be to host some sort of contest pairing business, liberal arts, and engineering students or some combination of them to create an answer to a problem or question, similar to a hackathon. This would help combine technical and non-technical skills and have students work together with people they usually would not do during their college careers. Finally, the SEC could facilitate with other student councils to allow students to attend their discipline-related events."

Last semester, I was a part of the Ignite Design Challenge, and I enjoyed that experience especially since freshmen have very few group design opportunities and helped mature certain needed skills. I hope that if I do get to be a member of the SEC, I will be able to help and create more opportunities like those for other freshmen and other engineering students. During middle school and high school, I was a leader in my Boy Scout troop for over six years, where I was able to teach others skills that they may not exercise daily. This was a very rewarding experience as I was able to watch these people grow over the years and be able to use these skills during events.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I was an officer in the Student Council where I would converse with other officers/members and come up with ideas for the school. During my last semester, we realized that the funds that our class was accumulating throughout the four years were not going to meet the prom budget, and we would have to cut down on costs. Although most seniors, including me, didn\u2019t care about how lavish prom was going to be, we knew that our club sponsor would get in trouble with the school administration if we didn\u2019t meet the budget. Most of the officers had \u201csenioritis\u201d and little motivation, so when I brought up the idea of creating a dodgeball tournament fundraiser, most turned it down. Despite this little participation by the other officers, I went against their wishes and planned out the fundraiser with my small team, and it was a huge success. Although it didn\u2019t raise 100% of the funds, I was still proud of my gut decision and the outcome that went with it.",
            "Question 9": "During the Ignite Design Challenge last semester, I enjoyed working with other freshmen to devise a solution to a problem while dividing out tasks and bringing it all together into one final project. However, we were only given one week to work which caused us to scratch some ideas to make the simulation more accurate and made us feel we could have done more with it. Since it was the first year doing Ignite, I feel SEC could build off it and make an excellent opportunity for underclassmen. The new changes I believe should give students not only a much longer time to work on the project but will have the choice to choose which problem scenario to work on. Once each team has their final product, they will get to present it in person in front of all the participants and explain their solution to their problem. This will give an excellent opportunity for Freshmen to mature must needed skills for their upcoming years in engineering as well as in the workforce."

Growing up, I knew I wanted to pursue STEM, but opportunities were limited. I knew I wanted to help change that, so I volunteered with my elementary school\u2019s robotics club in high school, mentoring 3rd-5th graders in their journey with STEM. As a member of my high school\u2019s VEX organization, I also participated in semester events where we showcased our robots to elementary students, teaching them about real-world STEM applications, along with our cool robots. These experiences not only reinforced my passion for engineering but also showed me the impact of inspiring others. I want to continue fostering STEM curiosity in young minds, just as the SEC fosters engagement and education in its community.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I led one of our VEX robotics teams. I was the only senior and the most experienced member and worked with a team of mostly underclassmen. While brainstorming an arm extender design, we were presented with two options, motors and pistons. Based on my experience, I suggested using motors instead of pistons even if the pistons were more finicky my team disagreed with me even though it was my final choice. Rather than shut down their decision, I saw an opportunity for a learning experience. I allowed them to prototype both designs and run tests to compare performance. During testing, the pneumatic system was unreliable with air constantly leaking, while the motor design worked smoothly after minor adjustments. This experience reinforced the importance of hands-on testing and data-driven decisions. In the end, we built a successful robot, and my team gained valuable problem-solving skills that can be used in all aspects of their life.",
            "Question 9": "After my first semester as a TAMU engineering student, my biggest challenge was finding a supportive, like-minded community. Many of us are far from home, navigating a rigorous curriculum without mentorship. Because of this, capable students often quit because they struggle to push through. I propose that the SEC establish biweekly community events where upperclassmen and freshmen can connect, share experiences, and build a support system. These \"Engineering Family Gatherings\" would feature different themes, such as study sessions before major exams or a big/little mentorship program. By fostering a sense of belonging and providing guidance, this initiative would help students overcome academic and personal challenges, not only increasing retention in engineering programs but excelling in the engineering program. This aligns with the SEC\u2019s mission by promoting engineering awareness, professional development, and a strong representative voice. With this initiative, more students can persist and succeed as Aggie engineers, hopefully paying it forward and helping others who were once in their positions."

I had always been interested in STEM as a child, so when I found out about the gender disparity in engineering, I was shocked seeing such a low number of women and minorities pursuing the field. This led me on a journey to inspire others to follow engineering. I helped create a Computer Science for Social Good club in high school, and hosted events about computer science to those who wanted to know more about coding and its capabilities. I joined robotics where I was able to teach aspiring elementary and middle schoolers about machinery and engineering.

We were understanding at first, but he gradually stopped fulfilling his responsibilities, even after his exams had already passed. Though his absence caused more work load on the other officers, none of them wanted to confront him because he was the club's advisors' son. However, it was unfair to have him as an officer when there were others that were more deserving of the position, so I privately confronted him about his lack of duties and told him the consequences if he couldn't complete the work he signed up for. However, he put in no effort to change, so I convinced the other officers to work with me to do something about his actions. Together, we all came to the advisor with our grievances which she begrudgingly agreed with, and as a result, he stepped down from the position. We created applications for his role, and gained a new officer that was able to fulfil her responsibilities, allowing us to run the club effectively again.",
            "Question 9": "A project that the SEC could do is visit different schools around the area and promote the different engineering pathways there are to students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The SEC already has the Envision Scholars Conference that is geared to help high schoolers in their engineering goals, but some students may not be aware of this event and miss out on potential opportunities. By visiting different schools around the area, we could also help give advice to high schoolers who might know they're interested in engineering, but don't know how to work towards it, or even introduce them to a different branch of engineering they didn't even know they were interested in. This project would also be a good opportunity to promote the Envision Scholars Conference or other opportunities that can help aspiring engineers obtain their goals. Along with that, we could also impact the lives of not only high schoolers, but younger children as well by introducing them to the many branches of engineering, and inspire them to become engineers themselves. Through these visits, we can not only spread more engineering awareness and inspire young students, but offer opportunities that they can use to become better engineers."

However, I disagreed. Not only did I see they were shared, but I also thought a $105 fine was unethical since none of our fines surpassed $10. The said member said I was biased since I was good friends with the secretary, and there weren't any loopholes for me to use. I decided to talk to my superior national officer for feedback. Ultimately, she agreed with me. So, I emailed the member informing her and mentioned how I understood her perspective, so the decision was up to the executive board vote instead of just mine. At the executive meeting, the secretary proved the meeting minutes were shared. So, the executive board decided against the fine, and the member apologized.

The objective is to increase engineering awareness through experiments showcased on social media. The potential impact would be to excite children and entertain teenagers about engineering.\nWe could record the ones we do with the kids at Lincoln Center if it is allowed. We would do more technical ones internally and build the internal relations as well. For Engineers Week, we would get fellow passing Aggie engineers involved and do an experiment in E-Quad. Lastly, we would get guest professors like Dr. Tatiana to be featured.\nWe could name it Experiment with SEC or Inspect with SEC!"

There are three core values I use to make all of my decisions. One of them is service. Back home, in Sugar Land, I started a non-profit LEGO camp that gave underprivileged kids a chance to experience STEM and get out for the summer. It took me all of my high school career to build the curriculum, collect and sort LEGO donations, spread the word and advance the program so it could still thrive once I left for college. I was able to hire 8 employees, and teach hundreds of kids about building, creativity and STEM. To give each kid a fair experience, the most I could place in one camp was 16. So, each week, morning and afternoon session became full after just two years. I miss it.",
            "Question 8": "I had to let go of an employee. In the program I mentioned above, I brought on a friend because our numbers were growing so fast, and I could no longer keep 16 kids listening to just me. Lollipops were not cutting it when they had millions of LEGO\u2019s at their disposal. After training, I allowed this employee to start working full-time with other counselors. I got three email complaints on separate camp sessions. I wasn\u2019t there, and the other counselor along side him had nothing to add to the complaints and said to \u201clet it slide\u201d. I couldn\u2019t let the program I worked so hard to grow diminish because I was blindly keeping a friend on the team. So, I had a one on one with this friend to go over the program guidelines and expectations that I held all of my employees too. When there was no improvement in his camp counselor abilities, I sadly had to let him go. I wasn\u2019t met with friendly words or actions afterwords, but I handled it in the most professional way I could.",
            "Question 9": "I was lucky to be introduced to engineering through my father. For many, this is not the case, and students are asked to choose a program track in high school before they even know all of their options. The Envision Conference is an amazing opportunity for highschoolers, and I know something like this would have been life changing for me and my peers. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t made aware of it or given the opportunity. I would like to bring engineering and STEM activities to the middle schools. One, so we can reach them before they have to start choosing classes that effect their college applications. And two, it gives Texas A&M Engineers a chance to give back to their communities. Engineering organizations like SAE, SRT, or any other organization that needs funding become eligible for more nationwide grants if they can prove they are doing so for educational purposes. Not to mention most organizations on campus, regardless of engineering affiliation or not, require service hours. Creating an opportunity for organizations to give back to their communities and foster creativity in the next generation will allow TAMU SEC to make a bigger engineering impact outside of College Station, TX."

            "Question 7": "The part of SEC\u2019s mission that resonates with me the most is fostering a professional environment of engineering students. In one of my organizations, I recognized that new students often felt overwhelmed and disconnected. I took the initiative to bridge that gap by planning study hangouts and social events, allowing freshmen an easier way to connect with other friends. This helped to ease their transition. My efforts not only eased their transition into college life but also sparked a deeper passion for engineering by encouraging communication amongst each other. Being a part of the positive impact of these efforts affirmed my belief in creating support amongst others\u2014a value I am eager to bring to SEC as we continue fostering the next generation of engineering professionals.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I faced the challenge of learning how to truly lead by example. As one of only two seniors on a water polo team mostly made up of freshmen and sophomores, I felt a responsibility to guide and encourage my younger teammates. Initially, it was intimidating\u2014balancing my desire to win while also dealing with younger teammates. However, I quickly realized that true leadership meant focusing on helping others grow, creating an environment where everyone felt supported, and demonstrating the values I wanted to see express our team.\nThe perspective I gained from this experience is that true leaders really empower others. They listen, support, and build others rather than seek personal gain or attention. I still embody this belief today by looking for opportunities to mentor and encourage others and by fostering spaces where people feel comfortable being themselves. My goal is to continue to grow as a leader, to remember that success is a team effort and that personal growth happens when we also invest in the growth of others. Having the opportunity to join SEC would allow me to face challenges with a different perspective and to put what I learn into action.",
            "Question 9": "Something that is close to my heart is helping to prevent suicide prevention. As someone who has experienced the loss and impact from losing a parent to this so young, I know my life will never be the same, and I wouldn\u2019t wish this on anyone. In the years following my father\u2019s passing, I\u2019ve been a part of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention community with my family. I\u2019ve actively walked and volunteered in community walks - the grief and emotions these walks carry is nothing short of profound. Thousands gather in memory of their loved ones, some sharing stories of their own struggles, and all are walking in support to raise awareness on the impact of suicide. These community walks are a place to accept and acknowledge the harsh realities of suicide, which is a subject that is often left unspoken given the magnitude of grief. These community walks help save lives - and that is the event I would want to design for SEC. These community walks would act as a medium to bring awareness to mental health, honor the Aggies we have lost to suicide, and create a way to let everyone know they are not alone."

            "Question 7": "The facet of the SEC\u2019s mission that resonates most with me is its role as the representative voice for all engineering students. However, further analysis showed me that the ESET department lacks a single representative within this organization. This means that 518 students lack a direct advocate in the premier organization that represents engineering students. Despite my demanding workload this semester, I am committed to bridging this gap and ensuring my community is heard within the broader engineering community at Texas A&M.\nObtaining my Eagle Scout provided me firsthand experience in initiating meaningful change. For my Eagle project, I took on a request from a local church my grandparents attended to design and construct custom cubbies that met their specific needs. This endeavor required organizing teams, collaborating with contractors, and ensuring that the final product effectively served the community. This project shows the abilities I hope to offer within this organization.",
            "Question 8": "Since 2023, I have worked as a seasonal tour guide at Space Center Houston, where I have faced a variety of challenges in managing large crowds. This past winter was particularly demanding, as guest attendance far exceeded facility capacity. Lines stretched for hours, creating frustration and logistical chaos. On one of these especially crowded days, I was tasked with relocating over a hundred guests to redirect traffic away from the shops\u2014a decision many were unwilling to accept, fearing they would lose their place in line.\nAt first, I successfully moved about a third of the crowd, but the majority remained resistant. Recognizing the need for a new approach, I coordinated with two fellow crew members to continue directing guests while I engaged with those who were most frustrated. Through active listening and clear communication, I worked to de-escalate tensions and reestablish trust. While that winter presented many chaotic moments, this experience stands out as a time when I had to navigate a socially difficult situation, enforce an unpopular but necessary decision, and ultimately help restore order in a high-pressure environment.",
            "Question 9": "My first suggestion has already been floated around within the SEC recently, but it would be the implementation of a paper pamphlet map for the career fair. During my time at Space Center, guests often used trifold maps to better navigate around. I like the online spreadsheet that contains the company list along with their booth locations. A paper pamphlet of this will act as a convenience as it offers every attendee a list of where each company is, with or without knowledge of the online spreadsheet. This allows people to game plan far more easily. In addition, the shaky condition of the internet at the venue means having a physical navigation device would be optimal and a great quality of life change.\nAnother big thing would be to spread the word about engineering technology. This was a major I only learned about upon my third DI Saturday, and the line between it and MXET was blurry. It\u2019s a cool major that offers a different approach to learning engineering here at A&M, and I hope prospective freshmen/companies can see this degree for what it is. Maybe sometime funds can be allocated to refurbish Thompson Hall, which hasn\u2019t been renovated since 1999."

Therefore, the SEC's second mission, to \"increase engineering awareness,\" strongly resonates with me. Not only do children and teens in Bryan/College Station need exposure to higher education and career opportunities in life, but rural kids do too. So, every time I am in my hometown, I talk to people--not only children and teens, but adults as well--about the opportunities that are available beyond the engulfing curtain of agriculture. My younger brother is often the recipient of my engineering advocacy, so I took him to my ENGR 102 class last semester for some exposure. I do not want to stop with him, though. I want to enlighten others as well!",
            "Question 8": "Throughout high school, I led our school's Ag Mechanics Build-Off team. In these competitions, you are given a few to several hours to take blueprints and construct anything from a barbeque pit to a trailer from uncut joints of metal. My team, at a gate-building competition, began having trouble with our welding machine very early on. After two of four hours of construction spent on altering our set up and troubleshooting the problem, I found that the gas coupling for the Argon/CO2 mix was improperly connected. Now we began working hard to catch up to where we should have been, but the welding might not be finished if I did not weld also. However, I also always fabricated each piece because I was very accurate in that work. So, I had the choice of either sacrificing build accuracy and integrity for finished work or not finishing but retaining build integrity. So, I made the ethical choice of the two and continued doing the fabrication myself. I did not think we were going to finish, but I picked up a welding lead finally and my brother and I met welding on the same final upright just as the buzzer sounded.",
            "Question 9": "Building off of question seven, I would to put forth a new initiative to advocate for engineering awareness in rural areas around the Brazos Valley and beyond. The initiative would be an outreach program where we hold a presentation at rural school districts--many of which would eagerly welcome a program like this--either in-person or virtually. To make it interesting, there could be an engineering demonstration or two, then an educational section providing information about engineering and the broad opportunities it provides, and finally how Texas A&M is the best place to get an engineering education or any other education for that matter. Its objective would be to educate students on the fact that there are many opportunities beyond their hometowns especially in engineering as well as how engineering affects their everyday lives in ways that they can be a part of by becoming an engineer. This initiative would not only impact each student by broadening their sights on the world beyond and enlightening them to engineering's extraordinary aspects but would also help to bring in more of a currently substantially small group of people who have the skills and work ethic to succeed in the College of Engineering."

Recently, I served as an officer in the Galveston Engineering Student Organization (GESO), the largest engineering organization on the Galveston Campus. GESO's goal was to conduct meetings and sessions that guided each student's academic and professional journey. The experience gave me a platform to connect with other students and be an outlet for members to have their concerns and needs addressed in a space where everyone is welcome. As Social Coordinator, it was my job to facilitate feedback and implement it into our organization and to advisors. This involvement made me want to continue helping others succeed and motivated me to continue to make a positive impact on other students. I want to be able to continue contributing to a collaborative and supportive community through the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "During my time in high school, I was employed at a Jett's Pizza company. Jett's Pizza is one of the more popular places to get food in my area, and it just so happened that Hurricane Ian was projected to hit Florida around that time. Once the hurricane hit land, our store owner made the questionable decision to remain open, making us one of the only restaurants open. Once called into work, we were so incredibly busy that we were backed up about sixty orders by 3 PM. Chaos within the store ensued and it was up to the management in the store to step up and keep things under control. There were many arguments about who should be doing what and if we should have even been at work at all, especially considering the increasing stress on both the workers in our establishment and the environment outside. We decided to have the more experienced members handling the cooking, while the rest of the members helped deliver and sort orders. By creating a plan and organizing the kitchen crew, we were able to get the rush under control and help catch up to the backlog of orders during the crisis.",
            "Question 9": "One of my favorite aspects about the SEC is the mission of making sure every student feels that their voice is heard. The Engineering Student Survey stands out to me especially, with how it asks for genuine feedback from all students on what should be improved. I feel that everyone has an opinion about their education, and these surveys help our voices be heard. There are already two surveys, one for freshmen and one for all engineers, but I think a third survey would be of incredible benefit to the College of Engineering.\nThis survey would specifically target post-ETAM students at the end of their first semester in their new major. It would gather feedback on students\u2019 experiences with the ETAM process, including how well they were prepared for it, whether the process aligned with what they were expecting, and how the process affected their experience at A&M. The survey could also assess the effectiveness of A&M's advising, the availability/accessibility of resources, and sense of community within their new departments. The data gathered from the survey could be implemented to improve and refine the ETAM process to increase student satisfaction with the results."

Curiosity cannot be expressed if it is not heard, so that is why me and 2 of my friends made a research project to create a certification process for people with High Functioning Autism, so that they can ensure any employer that they have the right to compete with any candidate. We are presenting this research in the summer at the American Society of Engineering Educators, in hopes of spreading awareness about the discrimination towards them. We are already seeing improvement as South West Airlines is offering an internship opportunity specifically for people with High Functioning Autism.",
            "Question 8": "One of the difficult decisions that really stood out during the STEAM Bridge event that I co-organized with a friend was about the design of one of our hands-on activities. We had planned a civil engineering challenge where students would build the strongest bridge, but there was a last-minute issue with the materials. Whereas some in the team wished to make the activity easier by changing some rules or using materials that might somewhat increase comfort, personally I did not want to violate the challenge.\nI explained my reasoning, saying that problem-solving under constrained conditions is educational and closer to how things really are in real life in the STEM fields. Not everyone agreed, but I dug my heels in to keep the original guidelines in place. I reassured the team that we would give them enough guidance to make it work.\nIt worked, and the students found the challenge stimulating; they came out with invaluable lessons in creativity and resourcefulness. The experience strengthened the need to stick to core principles while still being open to team collaboration and compromise-a tough call, but one which really paid off with the eventual result.",
            "Question 9": "If I were to design a new program for SEC, I would suggest \"STEMX: Engineering Beyond Boundaries.\" The program would bring together engineering professionals and students and quantitative finance, AI in medicine, and other interdisciplinary fields. The aim of the program would be to develop interdisciplinary collaboration and address the changing requirement of various skill sets to resolve complicated worldwide issues. The demand for cross-disciplinary working has never been more pressing.

STEMX would provide students with the toolkit and mentality to succeed in a rapidly changing jobs market, enabling them to tackle multifaceted problems from a variety of angles.\nThe requirement for inter-disciplinary cooperation has never been more intense. As technological innovation in AI and data science revitalizes sectors such as finance and medicine, the intersection of engineering expertise with these sciences is the actual essence of innovation.

This aspect most closely resonated with me because not only does being a representative voice mean upholding a certain standard for engineering students to look towards as an example of classes, maturity, and discipline, but it also means the organization serves as a pillar of support for all students in the College of Engineering. Through being an officer team for my HOSA chapter in my senior year, I fostered an inclusive, close-knit community of curious students who were eager to explore this vast field in categories of applied health science skills such as CPR and AED or exploring theories and discoveries in the field of biomedical engineering and biotechnology.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I was on the Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA) committee, and my school had a powerful chapter. However, once our sponsors left, there was no HOSA committee to rely on. It truly wasn't easy to cultivate the passion for health science again like in the past. However, through initiating and forming a group of passionate members who wanted to revive the spirit of HOSA competitions, socials, and events at our school, I formed a group and we reached out to all teachers at the school. We spread the message regarding reviving the club. Initially, we were met with discouraging remarks and reluctance from teachers, coaches, and assistant principals as they told us that reviving a 150+ member club from nothing would be challenging as it adds a lot of stress on sponsors. However, our group didn't hold back. Through constant determination and persistence, we were able to contact a biomedical science teacher to sponsor the club by facilitating previous advice from sponsors and officers. After reviving the chapter, I was promoted to president of the chapter in my senior year, and as a result, I revived the profound passion for health science across my high school.",
            "Question 9": "One initiative or project for SEC that I think would serve well for the members and the students that the organization represents is a buddy platform/portal. This doesn't necessarily have to be mentorship; however, it could serve as a portal where incoming freshmen still acclimating to engineering in college can voice their opinions and make new friends. They can find other freshmen or students in upper classes to meet with based on shared interests and hobbies. This will not only help to boost overall morale but will also help make incoming freshmen more adjusted to the college environment. It could be called Budd(IE)s, where \"IE\" indicates \"in engineering\" to specify the commonality of being a student in engineering. This can help students form study groups, understand what ETAM involves, help professionally with how to apply for research or jobs, and allow students to share insight on prior experiences and key takeaways. Overall, this would help ease the transition process from high school to college, as for many, it can be very daunting, and it can also help ensure comfort, confidence, and inclusivity in the College of Engineering."

            "Question 8": "In my first semester at A&M, I ultimately made the decision to move out of my dorm due to some safety concerns regarding my roommate. Although I did not discuss this decision with any of my peers, many people in my Living Learning Community disagreed with me, telling me that it was the wrong decision. I was disheartened to lose quite a few friends and terrified of potential retaliation from my roommate. As a result, I began experiencing minor panic attacks near my old hall. Even though I questioned my decision at times, even contemplating leaving the program, I ultimately chose to face my fears. A peer mentor encouraged me to continue to actively participate in the LLC. Over the next few weeks, I attended a few social events to establish other friendships and relationships. I discovered amazing new people, and even started studying with them in my old hall. Although I was hesitant at first, I found that these study sessions helped me overcome my fears. I\u2019m glad I stuck with my decision despite the challenges, as I would not have met the wonderful people I have in my life today.",
            "Question 9": "Towards the beginning of each semester, the SEC could host a social with board games, food, and other activities. Juniors and seniors who serve as TAs, as well as graduate students can briefly share their college experience along with engineering specific advice for the freshmen. They could discuss concepts to master in ENGR 102, navigating the engineering advisors, and other tips. Afterwards, everyone can enjoy the activities, which can include competing in team trivia, completing a multi-part challenge requiring 4 team players, capture the flag, or other team-building games. These activities would make the upperclassmen more approachable \u2013 creating a low-stakes environment where freshmen have the opportunity to bond with upperclassmen. Since first year courses are often saturated with freshman students, which results in less interactions and friendships with those of different class years, this event could narrow the divide and foster more unity within the Engineering department. For graduate students, especially those new to A&M, it provides them an opportunity to relax and socialize with fellow graduate and undergraduate students. To summarize, this event would not only highlight the engineering graduate students, but also guide freshmen \u2013 especially first-generation students \u2013 into entering their first year of college."

Along with another high school student, I reached out to the GT specialist at a nearby elementary school and worked with her to create an engineering club for students in grades 2 through 4. I was not sure that I wanted to pursue a career in engineering until my senior year of high school, which left me feeling behind on classes and other activities that related to my interests. Therefore, one of my main goals for this club was to increase engineering awareness for elementary-aged students and to introduce them to all of the different engineering disciplines at an early age.",
            "Question 8": "As is the case for many people, a difficult decision that I had to make was choosing what college to attend. I was accepted into my major of Chemical Engineering at UT Austin, and my parents and friends both strongly felt that I should choose that college over A&M. One of their main reasons was their belief that I would not fit in at a majority conservative college. While I listened to their concerns with open ears, I also kept in mind that the decision was ultimately mine to make. Additionally, I valued the traditions, network, opportunities, and scholarships that came along with attending Texas A&M. This difficult decision of mine ended with a positive outcome, as I am absolutely happy and content with my life at A&M. There is truly a place for everybody in such a large and diverse community, and I am glad that I stayed true to my own choice instead of letting the worries of others sway my decisions.",
            "Question 9": "SEC already has a lot of projects, demonstrating how established and widely reaching the association is on campus and in the community. One initiative that I would propose is based on the idea of the engineering club that I founded. The idea would be for SEC to collaborate with the engineering/science departments either at nearby schools in College Station or at high schools that regularly send a large number of engineering students to A&M each year. I see that there is an EnVision conference once each year that allows students to explore engineering, but this idea would involve a more regular partnership with schools. This program would aim to both foster love for engineering for younger students through hands-on STEM activities as well as recruit more high-achieving students to A&M engineering. Younger students that grow up with this program would likely feel more connected to engineering at A&M and would be more likely to attend this college over another."

            "Question 8": "Back in high school, I was president of school\u2019s first Computer Science Club. One tough decision I had to make was whether to focus on starting with the coding basics or a fun hackathon. Many of my officers wanted the hackathon because it sounded exciting, but I believed starting with coding basics would help more students feel confident before jumping into a competition. Like I mentioned, some of my officers disagreed because they felt the members would quickly lose interest and think of the club as \"school\" if we didn\u2019t go straight to the hackathon. To handle this, I first walked them through the amount of experience each of the members interested have and then proved a point how their is a serious unfairness in experience if we were to go straight into the hackathon. Then, I explained that focusing on coding basics first would help everyone build a strong foundation and keep it fair. In the end, the coding basics was a success as more freshmen/sophomores joined, and they felt getting more experienced for when the hackathon when it happened later. The club grew stronger, and I learned the importance of listening, explaining my decisions, and finding a balance.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, it would be a career fair specifically for high school students. While SEC focuses on college students, its mission to empower future engineers and raise awareness could start earlier. In high school, I organized a career fair and was amazed by how many students, even middle schoolers, showed up eager to learn about career paths. The objectives are pretty clear as first the goal is to introduce high school students to engineering and STEM-related careers. Second, provide hands-on workshops and activities to inspire interest in different fields of engineering. Lastly, connect students with professionals and companies who can share advice and opportunities. This event could lead to curiosity and drive in students at a critical and developing stage in their education. By showing them the possibilities early on, we can help them think beyond school and start preparing for their futures. On some next-level thinking, a successful event like this could scale to an even bigger level, establishing SEC as the bridge that helps young individuals find their path early on, boosting SEC\u2019s presence and reputation as an organization that inspires the next generation of engineers."

            "Question 7": "Representation most resonates with me because of its importance in every aspect of my life from governmental policies to a group project in class. Humans tend to divide self worth through factors such as money and status, destroying the platform for others to be heard. More importantly, it has a marginalizing influence on those who are already hesitant to speak up or contribute to an initiative. Personally, I can resonate with this as I struggled speaking up freshman year in highschool. After joining Speech & Debate, I found a community where I didn\u2019t have to live in constant fear of being rejected. I later realized this difficulty can be overcome by empowering others and offering a platform for everyone regardless of their background or beliefs. As my school\u2019s debate captain and coach for middle schoolers, I was able to magnify others' voices which I hope to extend through the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "During one of my shifts as a lead volunteer at the Perot Museum of Nature & Science, I noticed how each of the exhibits wouldn\u2019t receive equal attention. As a part of my report, I discussed this finding to the head staff. Unconvinced by the relevance, the staff told me this wasn\u2019t an issue to the museum. Instead of simply accepting this, I advanced my findings by spending the next week investigating all 12 exhibit halls. I recognized a pattern - the popular exhibits had 1-2 main attractions and were marketed more. The issue was several parents would be discontent due to their kids being stuck on a singular exhibit, preventing them from exploring the other ones. I found that diversifying the guests' experience wasn\u2019t only important for brand image, but the guest\u2019s satisfaction aswell. Consequently, I came up with the idea to alter marketing strategies to highlight 1-2 attractions for every exhibit. Persuaded by the idea, the staff allowed me to work alongside the marketing team for the next month. With a survey conducted through the museum, it was later discovered that the new changes helped parents expose their children to more scientific content, bettering the experience for everyone.",
            "Question 9": "I would create a Mental Health in Engineering initiative. I strongly believe that there is a current stigma that holds people back from addressing their mental health struggles. Whenever the term \u201cmental health\u201d is used, people jump to the extremes such as depression and suicide, completely avoiding their current state of mind that may include feelings of stress and burnout. This constant avoidance and neglect is what keeps them (myself included) away from developing healthier stress management habits that may mitigate the effects the engineering rigor has on the mind. The objective of this initiative is to create a supportive community that is open to each other\u2019s unique pressures. More importantly, it's to normalize conversations about mental health within the College of Engineering. Specifically, the initiative would include regular workshops/seminars on time and stress management, friendly peer groups, awareness campaigns, and an online resource hub for quick access. In hope to reach a broad audience, SEC would partner with campus counseling centers and local mental health professionals for expertise. If things go well, students will feel supported and manage their academic and personal pressures more effectively. Lastly, this would encourage future engineers to prioritize wellness in their careers."

This experience was significant because it helped me understand some of the different paths I could pursue. After explaining to recruiters that my major was \u201cData Engineering\u201d, I was presented with various career options. Some were business-focused and others were focused on concepts such as machine learning or optimization. This feedback excited me for my future and provided insight into how I could apply the skills gained through engineering to make an impact in the real world.\nThe clarity I felt during these experiences made me want to help others experience the same thing. Finding a fulfilling career is very important and by joining SEC I hope to continue to provide meaningful experiences for others, just as the career fair was for me.",
            "Question 8": "At my previous workplace, our manufacturing and inventory system was built on outdated open-source code, which led to inefficiencies. These quirks caused delays, extra manual steps, and difficulty in tracking hardware assignments.\nI pushed for updating the system to improve efficiency which would require lots of work as the inventory, manufacturing, and other systems were all connected through the same infrastructure. My manager, the head of engineering, supported the idea but we faced resistance due to limited developer availability and resources. I walked leadership through the manufacturing process describing the pain points that the staff has been dealing with for years. At this point, some of the leadership members were convinced while others thought company resources could be better spent elsewhere. As a result, I worked with supportive individuals to arrange meetings with those who were hesitant.\nAt the same time, I implemented my own software solution. I was finally able to convince everyone by developing and deploying an application that the manufacturing staff was able to use. This gave leadership a working concept to interact with, ultimately leading to an agreement. Through this effort, leadership agreed to gradually allocate resources towards implementing new infrastructure.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, it would involve partnering with local nonprofits and campus organizations to provide solutions for their specific needs. This initiative would aim to offer digital tools, such as custom-built websites and applications to help these organizations operate more efficiently.\nThe primary objective of this initiative would be to empower nonprofits by providing them with the technical support they may not have access to otherwise. I often see nonprofit websites or other community initiatives that could really use a boost to their website. It would also offer SEC team members the opportunity to collaborate across various disciplines such as product, design, and engineering while also creating real impact.\nThe potential impact of this initiative is that it would help local organizations improve their digital presence and better serve TAMU/surrounding communities. Secondly, it would allow SEC to engage in social efforts while giving members meaningful, hands-on experience that directly benefits both SEC and the community. By fostering these partnerships, SEC can contribute to the growth of nonprofits while also strengthening its ties to the local community, demonstrating a commitment to service."

The SEC is meant to improve the lives of engineering students, and a major part of that is ensuring they have a voice. In high school, I occupied a similar role in my student council. The majority of the student council had similar backgrounds, and mostly represented the same interests. As such, representing the viewpoints of the more marginalized groups\u2013such as LGBTQ+ members, neurodivergent people, and even just generally more introverted students\u2013was something I strove to achieve. It was well known that I would often have additional questions or objections meant to help these people thrive just as much as the rest of the school.

However, due to a series of malicious rumors against me, a rift opened between the other members and I.\nAt first, I believed it was my duty to continue on and perform, but after a few practice sessions, I quickly realized that improv relies heavily on trust. That trust had been shattered, with no prospects of mending it in time. Knowing that distrust would hurt our performance and everyone else had been so excited to perform, I chose to back out of the team. Originally, they were very upset about this, seeing it as me backing out because I was scared. However, I knew that this was right for the team and for me, and so I stuck with my decision. In the end, they achieved the second-highest award possible in the competition, a massive accomplishment that I was thrilled to learn of. Though it wasn\u2019t easy to step back from the team, it was ultimately the best for all of us.",
            "Question 9": "I think that the SEC should create an initiative to allow upperclassmen to assist counselors at the freshmen NSCs. The NSC has to process thousands of students, and as such, each one can only have so much attention. However, I believe certain students (myself included) felt left behind by the NSC\u2019s tendency towards one-size-fits-all advice. Selected upperclassmen could attend NSCs and offer their own, personal perspectives on which classes should be taken, what their favorite aggie traditions are, and more.\nMany freshmen feel intimidated by the large scale of the NSCs, and having these upperclassmen in the individual rooms on day 2 could allow a more relaxed, casual environment. Not only this, but advice could be tailored specifically to each freshman, with a blend of the counselor\u2019s long-term, general experience and the upperclassmen\u2019s recent, personal experience. This program could even be expanded to encompass a Q&A at the start of day 2 of the NSC, as well as surveys sent out at the end of the first and second semesters to request changes in advice given and services provided. Overall, this would make students feel more well cared for and confident in their class selections."

            "Question 8": "During a 24-hour coding hackathon for Toyota, I was given a team and prompt to make the Toyota website better for users. The biggest challenge my team and I faced during this hackathon was settling on the right idea. After hours of brainstorming different ideas, no idea could unanimous support from everyone. I realized during the brainstorming that at the rate we were going, we would've just kept going in circles and would've ended up with no product at all. I then stepped up to the plate, chose the most promising idea we had, and explained we needed to move forward and that achieving a finished product was more important than a perfect idea with nothing to show for it. Even though not everyone agreed with the idea, they recognized we did need to start coding and hesitantly agreed to start working. As we worked we began to refine the idea which resulted in an idea everyone loved. Even though my team did not get 1st place, we still did very well, and they appreciated the initiative I had taken. The experience reinforced my belief that good decisive leadership in high-pressure scenarios can drive a team to success.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC it would be the Engineering Communication initiative. This Initiative would essentially help Engineers achieve better verbal and written communication skills to help enhance their personal and professional success. Without a doubt, technical skills and job opportunities are extremely important, however, engineers struggle heavily with articulating ideas properly, presenting projects, as well as engaging in professional discussions. This can overall hinder career growth, collaboration, and leadership potential. This initiative will equip Aggie engineers with: confidence and skills to excel in professional environments, bridge the gap between their technical and communication skills, and improve teamwork, networking, and career outcomes. By launching this initiative, I believe that SEC can empower students to not only build solutions, but communicate them effectively, which will lead to the overall long term success of our Aggie engineers."

This is often the key reason most people are in college: to advance themselves and gain skills to launch a successful career. These skills can be built further upon themselves by extracurriculars, where people can develop soft-skills and professional skills through professional organizations. I have personally developed this value by joining professional organizations such as ASME, going to career fairs, working an internship this past summer, and lining up another internship for the upcoming summer. In addition to this, I have been a member of professional organizations in the past, such as the Society of Automotive Engineers and the Solar Car Racing Team to help myself develop professionally.",
            "Question 8": "For a CAD design class I took, there was a long-term project where my project group and I had to design a product and build a physical prototype to help retirees. For our product, we made an adjustable music box so the retirees could customize what notes are played. This would help with their cognitive abilities and allow them to be creative by making music in their later years.\nMy group was split into two, as one group wanted to use wood and metal the make the music box, but the other group was concerned about the time remaining to make the prototype, which was about 2 weeks. So, I mentioned the resources available to us, such as 3D printing and equipment at the FEDC, and what it would take to make the box out of wood and metal, especially with our limited experience with machining equipment. After additional respectful deliberations, we concluded that it would not be feasible to make the box out of wood and metal and instead chose cardboard and 3D printing. This allowed us to complete the project on time and still be of good quality and allowed us to get an A on it.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new project for SEC, I would focus on expanding the website to have a section on other engineering organizations to connect students to. I focused on this as I found that it was difficult to find out about engineering organizations except for the engineering open house. However, as this is a one-day event, it can be difficult to learn about all of the types of engineering organizations available to students and what they do, especially if a sickness or other event prevented someone from attending.\nBy expanding the website, SEC could help students become more involved in the school and get engineering organizations qualified members. Each organization would make a description of what they do, who they are looking for, how to meet them, how to apply, etc. Additionally, SEC could plan additional events to connect students to these organizations. Through this project, SEC would help advance the engineers at Texas A&M as a whole by providing more opportunities for engineers to apply their skills practically and develop professionally."

In high-school, I loved being part of the Academy Ambassadors program, where we visited elementary and middle schools to introduce students to different academies in our district. Seeing their excitement and curiosity as they learned about new opportunities was incredibly rewarding. Some kids asked if there was a career matching their interests, and being able to tell them \u201cyes\u201d and see their faces light up was a moment I\u2019ll never forget. As an engineering student, I\u2019ve faced similar challenges in choosing a path because the field is so broad. Events like Aggieland Saturday (during high-school) & Industry Nights helped me understand more about the different available options, and they ultimately confirmed that mechanical engineering was the right choice for me. Now, I want to help other college students gain that same clarity and help younger students discover their interests.",
            "Question 8": "When I decided to pursue mechanical engineering, my parents were initially against it. Like many Indian parents, they believed computer-science was the more practical choice if I wanted to do engineering. They were concerned about job prospects and believed mechanical engineering was mostly about maintenance and repair of existing machinery, like it was 30 years ago. Their doubts made me question my own decision. Was I choosing the right path? Could I even succeed in engineering if I didn\u2019t pick computer science? Around the time when I was doubting myself, we attended Aggieland Saturday where different engineering majors had presentations and tabling sessions. My dad got to hear directly from faculty and students about how mechanical engineering is now much broader, covering fields like robotics, aerospace, and energy systems. Learning about the versatility of the major changed his perspective of how the field has changed over the years. With their support I felt lighthearted. They trusted that I had made the right choice for myself, which in turn made me more confident stepping into a&m. This experience taught me that difficult decisions require patience, communication, trust in my own judgment, and that the right support can make all the difference.",
            "Question 9": "Graduate Pathways\nObjective and why? While there are many resources for graduate students, undergraduates often lack information on the different pathways they can take after earning their degree. This would help students explore graduate school options beyond just entering the workforce. For example, I was aware of MS and MBA programs but didn\u2019t realize there is a professional degree that prepares students for engineering careers (MEng).\nStructure- A workshop series could break down the different graduate school options, covering topics like the pros and cons of each path, funding opportunities, and how some companies sponsor grad school for their employees. With SEC\u2019s strong corporate relations, students could also learn about companies that offer such opportunities. Another great addition could be a panel of grad students and professors who could provide clarity and answer questions from undergraduates considering further education.\nEngineering x Business workshops\nObjective- Introduce engineering students to key business concepts like personal financial literacy, project management, entrepreneurship, marketing and leadership through interactive workshops.\nWhy? Many engineers enter roles where they need to understand budgeting and team management but traditional coursework doesn\u2019t always cover these areas. Skills like these can be helpful when developed early on.\nAnother quick one, a degree planner workshop!"

            "Question 8": "In the fall of my senior year I was named lead of the manufacturing team on my Robotics Team. My main task in the offseason was developing a manufacturing process that goes from cad to finished product. Next I researched different ways other teams do this until I implemented a system of manufacturing drawings, bill of materials, project management software, and part inspections. I presented this system to my team at the end of the fall semester to mixed feelings.\nMost reactions were that this system causes extra work on the students for a perceived non gain. Next I was faced with the decision of whether to pursue this project or revert to our older system. However the flaws in our old system were too significant to ignore. So I individually discussed with these students to find their particular issues with this new system. One of the main concerns with this system was the upfront investment in time before manufacturing begins. So together we devised methods to simplify and streamline the process. Once implemented, speed, accuracy and overall quality was improved significantly. This experience allowed me to improve my leadership skills through the input of my peers.",
            "Question 9": "I would like to propose that the SEC hosts an elementary or middle school level robotics competition. This could be a FIRST Lego League, FIRST Tech Challenge or a Vex Robotics event. The event could be an informal scrimmage or a formal qualifying event. To be most effective, we would likely start with an off-season scrimmage with less teams and later transition to an official event or multiple events per year. This event could be hosted in the Zachary Chevron rooms or alternate locations in College Station.\nThe objective would be that over a few years we grow these events to be premiere, high-quality events for all area robotics teams. The potential impact of this event could be significant on elementary/middle school students in our area. With events averaging about 12 teams, the impact could be from 60 to over 150 students impacted per event, in addition to parents, siblings, and other attendees. These events could also host other Engineering Student Organizations in order to inspire these students and exhibit engineering organizations."

Although I continue to admire this major, I didn't want it and my degree to be my only talking points when beginning my professional career outside of college. Because of this, I sought out leadership opportunities both for my professional development as well as to support others in their education. Thanks to my involvement with the first-year Century Scholars transition program, I have been fortunate enough to serve as a mentor for the 2024-2025 academic year. I have been able to provide support to my mentees in the same way Century did to me and I've grown professionally thanks to the collaberation and committment required from this position.",
            "Question 8": "While taking my ENGL 210 course last semester, I took up the role of project leader without much group consideration. While I can't say for certain if this decision was/wasn't unanimously agreed upon, I can say that it was something that needed to happen rather than something I wanted to happen. Due to the asynchronous nature of this ENGL 210 course, the second half of the semester was divided into group tasks/projects. As one can imagine in an asynchronous course, it can be difficult to get in contact with people who: 1. you have no contact information for and 2. is a complete stranger to you. With some assistance, these issues were alleviated. However as time went on, it became apparent that no one member wished to step up to coordinate an allotted plan for the week. Additionally, it was difficult to tell whether members were on the same page or not considering no prior communication had been made. Seeing this pattern made me realize that something needed to be done and thus, I stepped up. Thankfully, with their cooperation, we were able to structure our team to carry out our tasks/assignments to meet deadlines and ensure a satisfactory grade.",
            "Question 9": "I'm aware that SEC already has events catered to professional development revolving around professional speakers, professional resources, and experience that may or may not be relevant to a member's experience. I wish to expand upon these events and introduce my concept of an \"Overcoming Adversity Week\" which would consist of a full week where each day would contain a designated professional speaker and discuss a topic that relates to their experience overcoming adversity in their education leading up to their career after college. My reasoning for coming up with this idea relates to my own experience during speaker presentations. I've noticed that a lot of the time it is difficult to relate to a professional without having some common ground, especially someone with tons of experience working professionally. I noticed this pattern until I attended a presentation held by one of Bank of America's CFO in which she eliminated this concern by expressing her status as a Hispanic first-generation student, something I could relate to. I feel like a bigger emphasis on professionals with similar backgrounds to students would allow students to become more engaged with a presentation and truly feel like they learned something beneficial to their success."

The SEC gives engineering students a platform to express their questions, concerns, and ideas, this pillar allows for a welcoming and functional environment.\nSince the Fall of 2022, I have acted as a representative for the Chemical Engineering Department Undergraduate Student Advisory Council. As a representative, I have witnessed the benefits of positive representation of the students within the department. Not only are academic and social concerns addressed, but students within the department are empowered to take the lead in shaping their education, professional development, and overall experience here at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 8": "In 2021 I was eighteen and halfway through my senior year of high school. A maroon envelope came in the mail, I'd been formally accepted to Texas A&M. For many, while this had been a lifelong dream, my world also came crashing down. I grew up in the Canadian Rockies and had barely left the country, let alone uproot my entire life and attend a university on the other side of the continent.\nMy mother was against me attending, \"too far from home, too expensive\" she'd say, my father was adamant I attend and make the most of my College experience. Naturally, I was torn, this was a massive change. I was conflicted between attending University locally - taking the safe option and moving to Texas and going on an adventure. In the end, I elected to follow through with what seemed like a compromise. My family and I sat down and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of this opportunity. I attended the Chevron Engineering Academies to save money. At the same time I got to fulfill my dreams of attending Texas A&M, it was the best decision I could have made, and now I'm applying for the SEC!",
            "Question 9": "If I were to create a new initiative or project for the Student Engineers Council here at Texas A&M, I would aim to create an event that acts as a cross between the Career Fair and the Industry Nights. As a freshman, I was intimated by the sheer magnitude of the career fair, and know that among many of my peers that was a shared experience. The Industry Nights also felt almost impersonal; there were many others in the room, and I never felt like I could have a proper conversation and truly learn about the industry or organization. Many freshman students also feel discouraged from talking to recruiters as they do not have much practical experience, and there are a very limited amount of positions open to freshmen if any at all.\nI would aim to create an event that mimics the career fair on a smaller scale. This would allow freshman students to interact with willing company representatives and learn about the field, and potential opportunities for the future. Representatives of the companies would be able to devote their attention to these students and impart valuable information, leading to a productive and functional conversation."

            "Question 7": "What resonates the most with me is the profound feeling of wanting to spread engineering awareness. When I came to Texas A&M I wasn't sure that I wanted to do engineering. All I knew was that engineering was a good career choice to pick but I wasn't exposed to the thousand possibilities that it entails. Understanding the pathways one can take and the ways we can impact society is an eye-opening experience and I want to take a part in this cause. Helping people understand a topic can be very fulfilling and I lived this firsthand when I volunteered over the summers at my local church. Over the summers we would hold a summer camp in which we taught the younger kids more about the religion. Seeing their happiness from learning these new things made me very happy and I want to do something like that again.",
            "Question 8": "I was working at Cane's on a very busy Sunday. We were understaffed that day and as a result, the kitchen was very slow. During all this chaos one of my co-workers out of desperation insisted that we start loading the baskets with more chicken tenders than they can handle. This seemed like the obvious solution to get us out of this mess but it would highly compromise the quality of our chicken potentially causing the chicken to come out raw. Raw chicken can be very dangerous to eat causing food-borne illnesses. I\nquickly analyzed the situation and decided that it was in the best interest of this restaurant to not compromise food quality just to speed up our times so I proceeded as normal without loading the baskets. My co-workers got impatient at this but I held firm not wanting to compromise food quality. After this scenario I confronted my manager wanting to know what the right choice would've been and he assured me that I made the correct decision. When times get stressful it can become tempting to make rash decisions but it is always important to keep your integrity and do what is right.",
            "Question 9": "A new project that I would love to take part in would be some sort of mentorship program for aspiring high school engineers and even incoming freshman. It is definitely a great thing to be excited about becoming an engineer and receiving your acceptance to the engineering school that you want to go to, but a different thing is being ready for the challenges that come as an engineering student. Engineering can be tough and I myself faced many challenges getting started. I feel that I would've had a much better time my first semester or two if I would've had some type of guidance showing me the most optimal path to success within engineering. This could be as simple as guiding students in the classes that they should take in high school to better prepare them for the rigor of the college classes they are going to have to take. Another thing would be in the extracurricular activities and intrapersonal skills needed to be successful in the real world. All of these little things add up and would really up the quality of the engineers coming through this program."

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC mission that resonates with me the most is increasing engineering awareness. In a recent conversation with an Uber driver, I was asked about my classes for the day, and I brought up my coding class, but he was completely unaware of what coding was. This experience helped me realize that engineering isn't as widely accessible as I thought it was. In high school, I organized a bake sale benefiting the JED Foundation to raise mental health awareness. During the bake sale, I got to speak with a lot of people personally affected by mental health and suicide, and it was through those conversations that helped me realize that awareness isn't about providing information but about actively engaging communities. With the SEC, I hope to increase engineering awareness and accessibility among youth in the Bryan-College Station area through active engagement with schools.",
            "Question 8": "A time I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with during the most recent TAMUhack hackathon. My team had spent a significant amount of time brainstorming, and we hadn't started coding our project, which caused us to fall behind and not make progress. Seeing this, I strongly advocated for my idea and explained my reasoning as to why I believed my idea was more suitable for the hackathon. Initially, it was difficult to push for my idea as we were a group of three, and it was either my idea or my teammates idea, and the third teammate didn't want to take sides. However, after clearly explaining my idea, how we would go about implementation, and how the idea was unique and set us apart from other competitors, I was able to successfully persuade my teammates to support my project idea.",
            "Question 9": "A new project I would create for SEC would be an afterschool engineering program at local elementary or middle schools. I had access to afterschool STEM programs like \"Mad Science,\" and my high school heavily pushed for its students to take STEM curriculum; without this exposure throughout my childhood, I likely wouldn't have chosen to major in engineering. The objectives of this project would be to partner with a local school to offer a weekly afterschool program with engineering-related activities such as science experiments, scratch, engineering challenges, etc. The potential impact of this project is that it would spread STEM awareness and accessibility and increase interest in engineering among children in the Bryan-College Station area. This idea is similar to EnVision; however, going to the students rather than the students coming to us and being an ongoing program increases accessibility and allows for the students to grow a long-term interest in engineering."

For example, I have engaged in technical (resume, elevator pitch, etc.) workshops and joined career-aligned organizations (Aggie Coding Club, Aggie Data Science Club) in order to expand my knowledge and gain professional skills. Additionally, I have worked on team projects that apply my engineering skills to real life applications, helping me develop problem-solving and teamwork skills. By joining the SEC, I would love to participate in events which help prepare students for their future careers.",
            "Question 8": "One difficult decision I had to make was balancing my time between multiple commitments like coursework, student organizations, and social gatherings. I said yes to every opportunity I got, whether it was workshops, sports, or doing projects on top of homework and studying. I felt as if I was overexerting myself which negatively impacted my personal goals and well-being. I decided that I couldn't keep doing this to my health.\nTo address this, I made the tough decision to back out of certain activities, even though my friends and peers didn\u2019t agree with my choice. They wanted me to be more involved and not miss important opportunities. However, I stuck with my decision, evaluated what I prioritize, and explained my perspective to them. I told them that I wanted to spend more time doing activities that are more aligned with my goals.\nDespite the setback and loss of relationships, the overall outcome was positive. I dedicated my time to activities that mattered the most. This was a great learning experience as I learned about my limitations and how to say no. Looking back, I am glad I made the decision because it allowed me to grow and move closer to my goals.",
            "Question 9": "I would initiate a hands-on engineering industry learning initiative for the SEC. It would be an initiative to help bridge the gap between students and real-life industry experience.\nThe primary objectives would be:\nWorkshops- The workshops would allow interactive learning from various Industry professionals. We would also include a small preview of these workshops in mandatory engineering classes (ENGR 102 and 216).\nHands-on projects- These interdisciplinary hands-on projects would develop students\u2019 technical skills in various fields along with mentorship from industry professionals.\nNetworking- Networking with companies will allow students to practice making connections and help them with internships and jobs.\nThe potential impacts of this would be:\nCareer Readiness- Students will gain technical knowledge and insights about industry expectations, boosting their success in their professional experience.\nIndustry Connections- Students will expand their network through mentorship and networking events. This will also help them land jobs and internships.\nMore Student Engagement- Through all of these events, students will be able to be more involved and better understand what they want to do in the future.\nI would implement this because it aligns with SEC\u2019s goal of professional development and increasing engineering awareness and allows students to be better prepared for their future career."

Networking, internships, co-ops--these words were foreign to me but were parroted by every professor and counselor. My savior was a former SEC member, who not only explained these terms to me but also helped me understand the importance of professionalism and building connections. Now, as a sophomore in SWE, I see the wide-eyed curiosity of the freshmen, asking the same questions I asked not too long ago. I pass on the information given to me, fixing their resumes, building a LinkedIn profile, and practicing how to act in a career fair. This is why I most resonate with the SEC's mission of professional advancement for all engineering students, so no one has to wander blindly like I did.",
            "Question 8": "In my senior year of high school, I acted as a co-leader of an engineering team tasked with building a boat that people could use and row. We initially had big dreams, including enough space for three people, benches for sitting, and artistic designs on the side of the boat. However, we severely underestimated the time it took to create the foundation of the boat, and we found ourselves cramming at the last second. After conversing with my partner, we decided to size down the boat from three to two people and forgo the decorations. This upset the member who was set to be the third rower and the artist who had painstakingly created a complex design for the boat. Though the situation was difficult, I placated the rower by letting him row during the practice round before the final test, and I asked the designer to revise her design into a flag instead. Although our initial dreams did not come to fruition, we were able to find ways to ensure some of the original ideas remained while still completing our objective of creating a boat.",
            "Question 9": "A potential initiative for the SEC could be to hold a panel or meeting where engineering alumni from TAMU come in and talk about their step-by-step path in their career advancement. Most people are quite vague when asked the question, \"How did you get your job?\" but this panel could provide much-needed clarity. The alumni could expand on the exact steps they took, from showing their resumes from freshman year all the way to senior year, and explain the changes they made to appeal more to recruiters. They could also discuss the clubs they were involved in and how their experiences helped them secure internships or jobs. Topics like networking with people in higher positions, negotiating salaries, and dealing with challenges at work\u2014both with colleagues and the job itself\u2014would be insightful for those who wish to follow in the alumni's footsteps."

I am always open to help and develop other people's growth, whether that's through teaching or simple advice. I was apart of a similar organization at my high school CTE program, where me and a group of students would bring individuals from industry to give talks to our engineering program about job opportunities, internships, and even interview advice. They would share their professional and personal advice to us as a way of developing the future generation of engineers. I hope to continue to help the future generation of engineers by providing them the opportunity to develop right alongside me through the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "During a Mechatronics competition in high school me and my teammate were struggling to figure out a way to make our program run consecutively. The program was supposed to extend a cylinder and drop a bottle cap into a bin and then retract back into its original position. Throughout the process we were using logic gates to try and achieve our goal but kept getting stuck on the retracting portion as it interfered with the other commands. As our timer was running out I suggested to my teammate to use timer relays to carry out the same function as the logic gates. He initially disagreed with my idea but I calmly explained to him that we were running out of time and that it would be easier to simply time the commands one after another as opposed to logic gates. We ended up placing second at the SkillsUSA state competition.",

This could potentially impress employers and allow students to have a chance to tackle real world industry problems. Companies would send their issues and problems to the SEC and based on this, students would have the opportunity to choose which problem they would like to solve. There could be categories such as electrical, manufacturing, supply chain and other types of categories. The objective would be for students to test their skills in workplace scenarios and it would be a great opportunity for them to network with companies at a larger scale, truly showcasing their skills and abilities. This would also give industry workers a better appreciation and interest in Aggie engineers as they could see how capable they are of solving problems."

The company had extensive monthly MIS reports filled with raw data, and I noticed discrepancies and inconsistencies in some figures. While my supervisor wanted to present the data as it was, I believed that addressing these inconsistencies and presenting a clearer narrative was essential to gain investor trust.\nTo resolve this, I took the initiative to dive deeper into the data, cross-referencing various reports to identify and correct errors. I also recommended restructuring to highlight key performance indicators that demonstrated the company\u2019s growth potential. This approach required additional effort and extended timelines, which initially led to a lot of disagreement within the team. However, I handled the situation by clearly explaining the potential risks of leaving the issues unaddressed and presenting a draft that showcased how the revised data could create a stronger impact.\nEventually, the team agreed to my approach, and the pitch deck received positive feedback from prospective investors, contributing to successful fundraising from Shark Tank India.

The executive council of the SEC does not contain any NUEN major. As a member of the SEC, I would work toward increasing the representation of underrepresented engineering majors at TAMU.\nMy first initiative would be partnering with the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) to host something similar to industry night. Students will explore the 23 million sq. feet experiment station, and browse the surface of the 1600+ research projects being worked on at TEES. This would expose general engineering majors to the practical application of their major. It would also combat the pre-conceived notion of many engineering students of university being a trade school, exposing the availability of jobs in research, rather than solely in industries."

My parents wanted me to attend Texas A&M because of the university\u2019s culture and core values, and my siblings wanted me to attend UT Austin because all of them are alumni. Unfortunately, I noticed that my parents began to feel indifferent towards my siblings for trying to convince me not to listen to them. This began to form an unspoken divide between my family members. After noticing their attitudes toward each other, I reminded them that this was my decision, and it should not destroy the unity of our family. Obviously, I chose Texas A&M, but the decision was far from easy because I knew someone would be hurt either way. Even though my siblings were disappointed by my decision, I helped them understand that I chose the university that I believed I would be the most successful at. In the end, they were still happy for me, and they respected my decision.",
            "Question 9": "I admit that I felt lost, alone, and uninformed several times throughout my first semester of college. I believe that if the goal of the SEC is to bridge the gap between students and the administration, then the SEC should begin hosting mentorship programs. During my time at Texas A&M, I have found it difficult to schedule advising appointments since the engineering program is so large. When I am able to schedule an appointment, the time I am allotted with an advisor is never sufficient. I believe that a mentorship program would be extremely beneficial for underclassmen in engineering, as there is much information to be relayed. Ideally, the mentors would be comprised of willing upperclassmen in the SEC. They would be assigned a small group of underclassmen engineering students with the same or a similar major to them. Based on my experience as a freshman so far, I believe that an ideal mentorship program would provide advice on how to stand out in the ETAM application, how to succeed in required engineering classes, and that it would establish a lasting friendship for freshmen who are still trying to find their place at Texas A&M."

I suggested a layout that incorporated both simplicity and creativity, allowing for easy interaction while still being visually appealing and educational. I worked closely with the team to refine the idea, ensuring that it was both engaging and manageable for the kids. In the end, the station was a success, and we received positive feedback from attendees. This experience taught me the importance of finding middle ground, leading with initiative, and collaborating effectively to create solutions that meet everyone\u2019s goals.",
            "Question 9": "I would create the Engineering Escape Puzzle Competition. The competition consists of two parts: teams can either design an intricate escape puzzle or attempt to decipher puzzles created by other teams. The team that designs the puzzle taking the longest time to solve wins, while the team that solves puzzles the fastest also wins. This competition encourages engineers to think outside the box, combining technical expertise with creativity to craft engaging and challenging puzzles. On the flip side, solvers get the chance to showcase their quick thinking and collaboration skills under pressure. It\u2019s a dynamic, hands-on way to foster innovation, problem-solving, and teamwork while providing participants with an exciting and rewarding experience. In addition to the intellectual challenge, the event creates opportunities for participants to network and collaborate with others from diverse backgrounds, enriching the overall experience. The competition also provides valuable exposure to real-world engineering challenges, offering a chance to apply classroom knowledge in a practical, creative setting."

It has been for quite some time I was a student chair in my high school\u2019s student cultural initiatives council where we tried to not just improve the culture of the school and support students, but also making sure that the various cultures of all the students were appreciated and respected. I served on my class council with the overall intent and purpose to effectively and efficiently be able to bring my fellow students voices and opinions to the table and hopefully act on them.\nBeing seen and heard should not be a privilege. Everyone should have the opportunity to be seen and heard, and this resonates with me because being seen and heard actually changed the trajectory of my life, so I really want to pass that on.",
            "Question 8": "When I was vice-president of the comp-sci club, a few weeks into the school year, we ran into a problem. A group of non-member students liked to come into our lunch meetings and hang out with their friends who were members of the club. This resulted in nothing being accomplished, because of the unrelated conversations going on. I didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate for me to directly address the issue without communicating and working with the other officers. After weeks of trying to work with my fellow officers to increase our productivity without any success, I consulted with the president one final time, when I was met with: \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a problem\u201d. I knew if this wasn\u2019t taken care of now, this club that I\u2019d been in since its inception. So I spoke to our club sponsor, I used her influence to create change. I told her, \u201cI think one step to increase our productivity is by only allowing members in our meetings.\u201d She relayed my exact words to the club president and the problem was resolved. We were able to complete more activities in the next meeting.",
            "Question 9": "In my first semester I was having a hard time deciding what major I\u2019d like to pursue. I wasn\u2019t sure at all if engineering was something I wanted to do. I was terrified I\u2019d invest a lot of time and money into a degree that would lead to a job I would hate and I would be miserable for the rest of my life despite the industry nights, DI saturdays, and engr 102 modules.\nAn internship wasn\u2019t an option; nobody would hire me with my lack of substantial experience. I would like to create something where companies would let batches of students do a mini internship over a couple days. Where students go through a bootcamp to gain the skills they\u2019d need to make low level versions of projects professionals would make at a higher level. Then students would try to make that project, and as they did other things would happen that simulated the daily life of a professional. At the end of it their project would be assessed and the high level project they\u2019d be trying to replicate would be presented with more detail. The students who enjoyed this would know that this is a plausible career path."

From an early age, I cultivated professionalism and a strong business acumen, both from my upbringing and my involvement in organizations such as NJHS in middle school and DECA, NHS, and other organizations in high school. I have also always been an active contributor volunteering in my community. Currently, I actively demonstrate professionalism through my role in PREP, a FLO that emphasizes professionalism. As a member of the Leadership Development committee, my responsibility is to help fellow freshmen grow professionally, and I do this by preparing them for interviews or, as recently as yesterday, assisting them in refining their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and LinkedIn profiles. I recognize the critical importance of developing professionalism in college to ensure that students graduate career-ready.",
            "Question 8": "One of the toughest decisions I\u2019ve made was choosing a college. I had offers from A&M, UIUC, ASU (on a full ride), and Northeastern. I had to make a choice, so my dad and I created a formula, ranking factors like location, weather, proximity to home, expenses, and more on a weighted scale. Surprisingly, ASU ranked the highest, but even with a full ride, I was hesitant to go. My mom pushed for UIUC, believing it was the best school I got into with a guaranteed major, while my dad thought I should follow the formula and choose ASU, and he liked the idea of a full-ride and guaranteed major. However, I wanted to stay close to home, and A&M\u2019s reputable engineering program stood out to me. My parents initially tried to persuade me otherwise, but I remained persistent, emphasizing A&M\u2019s strong academics, in-state affordability, and drivable distance from home. Eventually, they came around, but they reminded me I\u2019d have to work harder than ever since my major wasn\u2019t guaranteed. And so far, it looks like I've made a very good decision and I'm really enjoying my time at A&M.",
            "Question 9": "A project I would create for the SEC is a Community Engineering Initiative, where each semester, the SEC identifies a need within the Bryan-College Station community that requires engineering expertise. Whether it\u2019s improving infrastructure, assisting local schools with STEM-related projects, or designing sustainable solutions for community issues, this initiative would allow SEC members to apply their technical and soft skills in a meaningful way. With a diverse group of engineers across different majors, the SEC can assemble specialized teams to tackle projects based on their expertise. For example, civil and mechanical engineers could help design or repair community structures, while electrical and computer engineers could assist with local technology needs. This initiative would add a hands-on, technical aspect to SEC\u2019s mission, giving members real-world experience while fostering a strong connection with the local community. By working on projects, SEC members would not only enhance their engineering skills but also create a lasting impact, reinforcing the idea that engineering is about solving real problems and improving lives. Over time, this could evolve into a well-recognized tradition, strengthening SEC\u2019s role as both a professional and service-oriented organization."

            "Question 8": "As a Team Leader at Chick-fil-A, I often had to make decisions that weren\u2019t always popular with my team, but were necessary for the success of the shift. For example, during busy periods, I sometimes had to reassign team members to less preferred roles, like cleaning or managing the drive-thru, to ensure we operated efficiently. Some employees expressed frustration, feeling that these roles were less rewarding or harder work.\nI handled these situations by openly communicating the reasoning behind my decisions. I explained that every role was crucial to keeping the team running smoothly and that I still valued their flexibility and contributions. I also made sure to rotate responsibilities fairly, so no one felt stuck in an undesirable role for too long. By being transparent and acknowledging their concerns, I was able to maintain morale and ensure the team worked cohesively.\nBecause of this, we became one of the top-rated Chick-fil-A franchises in the nation, and over time, team members became more understanding of the bigger picture and more adaptable to changes.",
            "Question 9": "I want to join SEC because I know I can make a difference to help every engineering student. Many students have difficulty in finding internships or in developing their resume for companies. To resolve this, I would create a new industry partnership program. The goal of this initiative would be to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application by establishing stronger ties between students and top engineering firms. Students could learn about partnering companies online and begin making real connections within the company throughout the year, instead of just at the career fair. The companies could offer design challenges, meet and greets, or give presentations on their company and how to be a good applicant. By helping students to build relationships with engineering firms and companies, SEC would provide students opportunities for project sponsorships, internships, and research collaborations.

In high school, I greatly benefited from my AP Chemistry teacher as he was able to help me refine my interests and explore my passions. I wish to model this mentorship and provide many resources to current students through the SEC. At Texas A&M, I have greatly benefited from many extremely informative events such as Industry night and DI Saturday. I am always sharing opportunities and resources to friends and peers, and I would like to do this on a much larger scale in the SEC. I also have been able to mentor high school students both through Chemistry tutoring and connecting them to programs and invaluable resources.",
            "Question 8": "One time I had to make a difficult decision was when I drove back from Colorado to Texas. Some friends and I had just spent the week in Breckenridge over winter break and needed to drive back home to Austin. My friends wanted to leave as soon as the ski day ended at 5 pm and drive straight for 17 hours. However, I thought it would be more prudent to spend the night in Denver and leave the next morning at 4 am. This was a difficult conversation as we all wanted to get home safely but had different ideas of what \u201csafely\u201d meant. We spent several nights discussing, and considering each person\u2019s perspective. We even sought advice from local Coloradians who were more familiar with weather patterns and road conditions. We did our best to keep the conversation civil and logical, there was no room for rash, emotional decisions. Ultimately, we were all able to agree that leaving the next day was smarter. While we could\u2019ve made the drive if we left right away, it was definitely safer and less stressful to leave the next morning. In this case, simply surviving was not the only priority.",
            "Question 9": "One initiative I would bring is a mentor program. This would connect a current student with aggie alumni. I have greatly benefited from having a mentor, and I believe having conversations is the best way to figure out one\u2019s own aspirations and identity. The immediate benefits would be seen in the undergraduate students as they can easily get guidance on careers, classes, internships, or student organizations. What you put in is what you get out, and the more, as the point of this program is simply to make advice available. The more conversations you have, the more you will get out of it. I believe this program would also benefit the alumni as well. Having conversations such as these could also help an alumni, as they too might not even know what their final career path may be. A program such as this also fosters community engagement, helping alumni stay in touch with the alma mater. A student who went through the alumni-mentor program and greatly benefitted from it would be more likely to return the favor once they graduate, creating a cyclic aggies building up aggies effect."

Our university is made up of students from all different backgrounds, adding enriching value to our community. Texas A&M is a family, and its main goal is to help one another. I see this most at the Students Engineering Council through the events and opportunities provided. As a student myself, I find this extremely encouraging as we approach the daunting idea of finding a job. I incorporate this into my life by helping fellow classmates by tutoring and showing them the ways I redesigned my resume.

            "Question 8": "From the earliest time I can remember, I was taught to be a War Eagle. Three generations of my family have been a part of the Auburn University family, and expected me to join the same tradition. It wasn't until senior year that I learned about Texas A&M, and was then faced with a hard decision. My new interest in Texas A&M raised a lot of tension in my house. Like me, my whole family was thrown for a loop because there had been a great plan in place for my future. Why did I want to change it? My parents were quite apprehensive with my decision to come because they thought they knew what was best for me. In order to get us all on the same track I needed to understand where they were coming from. Getting their perspective was so important because it led to an important conversation where I was able to absolve their worries and put confidence in myself. I am now a sophomore at Texas A&M and my parents couldn't be happier with the amazing school I chose and all the opportunities it has given me.",
            "Question 9": "For a new initiative for SEC, I would create a mentorship program for engineering students to get advice and information to help them enter the work field prepared and excited. In this program, the mentors would be both college students and experienced engineers. The primary purpose of this program would be to provide students with guidance in the career field and navigate them through the tougher years of college. I believe that creating a mentorship program would allow the students an opportunity to gain valuable information that cannot be fully learned and understood through online courses. Along with a student being assigned a mentor, they would also be given a discussion group that would meet bi-weekly. In this group the students would be given the space to collectively share different ideas and learn from one another. By taking a personal hands on approach with mentor and mentee, the student will most definitely feel more confident when leaving the program. This mentorship would not only benefit the students, but also shine a positive light on the university and the engineering community."

However many students, especially younger ones, don\u2019t even consider engineering as a career path just because they feel like they aren\u2019t good at math/science even if the topics interest them.\nI saw this firsthand in a research lab where I had the opportunity to introduce some technical topics to other students who didn\u2019t come from an engineering background. Some of them felt intimidated by the topics but as I guided them through the learning process, some of them realized that they really enjoyed what they were learning. That moment made me realize how important spreading engineering awareness is because it can get others to consider engineering as a career path when they never would have considered it beforehand.",
            "Question 8": "One time I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with was during a group project where I was leading a couple of students who were a year younger than me. We were working on building a golf game but many of us had different ideas on how we thought the game should be built. On one side, a couple of the kids wanted the game to be a pixelated-style story mode game. On the other side, they wanted the game to be a realistic golf game. I considered both sides and decided to go with the realistic golf game because building that game was more practical given our time constraints and resources. I also tried incorporating ideas from the other side like having a mini storyline and having casual graphics so the game is more appealing. The final product looked great and was extremely fun to play. The realistic nature of the ball made the game fun but the mini storyline added the cherry on top because it brought personality to the game.",

I\u2019ve noticed this with a lot of my friends who are currently unsure about which concentration area they want to pursue a career in. Many of them just end up picking an emphasis area that they think is interesting but later regret it. They also can\u2019t change it because they\u2019ve already taken many electives and internships within the concentration area that they no longer enjoy. Their resumes also only have experiences within that area so it\u2019s hard to switch to another specialty.\nI believe that this event would give students a great opportunity to learn and ask questions about different subfields within their majors and make an informed decision about what concentration area to choose."

Many students may feel a lack of support in adjusting to the engineering curriculum but the SEC has an incredible opportunity to hear those needs. I tried to best represent the needs of my high school\u2019s student body through my position as a House President during my senior year. I was in charge of choosing weekly competitions for the student body to participate in, organizing an annual school-wide debate, and coordinating a video competition that each of our school\u2019s houses competed in.

Although there were objections from upperclassmen officers that the freshmen would not take the game seriously enough and would jeopardize our team's strength, I wanted freshmen to feel involved in their team and not just be standing on the sidelines. I wanted our school\u2019s competitions to help integrate freshmen into my school\u2019s community, instead of simply catering to upperclassmen. Even though there were original objections to letting younger players compete, allowing freshmen to participate resulted in a wonderful experience for everyone involved. Amazingly, one particular freshman girl named Maizey even ended up scoring significant goals for our team!",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for the SEC, it would be to provide a more informative process for Industry Night. After observation as a Freshman within the engineering department, most freshmen simply attend whichever industry nights are available to fulfill a requirement, instead of finding ones that might be truly informative to them. The information for industry night seems rather vague and unclear, and often students feel uncertain about which sessions to attend. I would like to start a brief but informative coffee and cookies meet & greet where SEC could provide more detailed information to freshmen about the different industry nights occurring throughout the semester and how to choose one that best fits their interests. During the coffee, students could enjoy a nice treat during their day to relieve the stress of classes and also gain a better understanding of industry night speakers and potential opportunities to learn about future careers. If freshmen better understood those speaker\u2019s events, they could find one that fits their needs."

I knew it wasn\u2019t the kind of issue you could just ignore, so I pushed for going over the deadline time to get it right, even though some of the other interns I worked with did not agree. It ultimately did get delayed and took some extra time and effort, but in the end, I believe we had launched something users could reliably use. That experience stuck with me because, at the end of the day, credibility matters, and that would be something I\u2019d bring to SEC whether it\u2019s planning events, handling outreach, or making decisions. I\u2019d always prioritize making sure things are done right, and hopefully done on time, and that students know they can rely on SEC as a consistent presence.",

This initiative could be a possible solution to that and have a mix of interactive guides, student-led Q&A sessions, and quick-start toolkits that break down things like research, internships, skills in tech, and networking into something actually useful and approachable for. This could either be a website or a virtual/in-person event and could be targeted towards freshmen or transfer students. It ties back to what SEC does best, being that reliable place for every engineer, no matter their background. Giving students a clear starting point could be the push they need to take advantage of everything SEC has to offer."

Our team was designing a pH adjustment system for water in space, and we had a budget of $1,000. We initially debated between two different mixing and injection mechanisms\u2014one that was more cost-effective but had potential reliability issues and another that was more expensive but met NASA\u2019s sterility and zero-gravity requirements.\nDespite resistance from some team members who prioritized cost savings, I decided to push for the higher-quality, more reliable system, as it aligned better with our mission requirements. To handle the disagreement, I facilitated technical trade studies, showing the long-term benefits of our choice.\nIn the end, our prototype was successfully built, tested, and presented at Johnson Space Center, validating the decision. The experience reinforced my ability to lead, justify technical decisions, and navigate team conflicts effectively.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an Emerging Technologies Initiative to bridge the gap between academics and real-world applications, preparing them for industry, research and leadership roles. One objective would be to partner with engineering companies and alumni to provide technical training in software, hands-on prototyping, and resume/interview prep tailored for engineering roles. Another objective could be to host events that showcase emerging technologies and interdisciplinary innovations, increasing engagement among all engineering students."

I became an engineer because I wanted to help people, including showing them the wonders of engineering. I\u2019ve done that through my organization TAMU-SRT. We participated in the SEC EnVision Conference last fall and plan to participate again this spring. Seeing the elementary schoolers be amazed by our projects was a great feeling. It felt like my team and I were inspiring them to explore the STEM field at a young age. Engineering awareness is important because engineering is an important part of everyone\u2019s daily lives. I\u2019m excited for SRT to participate in the spring SEC EnVision Conference because we get to show another group of young students the amazing things that happen with engineering.",
            "Question 8": "A difficult decision I had to make was deciding if I wanted to be SRT\u2019s Business Team Lead. At first, I disagreed with my decision because being in a leadership position involves more time commitment than being a regular member. I wanted more time to work on school because ETAM was coming up. I knew that if I applied to be the Business Manager and got the position, I would have to be more strict with my time management and focus on doing assignments to have time to do my tasks for SRT. I soon recognized that being a part of the management team would help me become a better student. The difficult decision I faced was solved by listing the pros and cons and seeing if one outweighed the other. The outcome is that I am always bragging about being the Business Manager of SRT as a civil engineer.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new project for SEC, it would be a social event for the ESOs. After being in an ESO for almost two years, I have never interacted with other teams at events besides the President\u2019s Round Table event by SEC. Sometimes, I see other ESOs, but it\u2019s when my organization is tabling with them, so there\u2019s never much interaction. It\u2019s important to have an event where all ESOs can socialize with each other to share their goals and activities coming up and see if there could be any collaboration between them. Having the social would highlight the connection between all ESOs, that we are all in engineering organizations doing awesome things that represent Texas A&M."

Having lived in three different countries and being part of diverse cultural environments has taught me the values of building a tight community and fostering inclusiveness. These values have motivated me to develop my own ways of giving back to communities that have shaped my life. As I worked to serve as my high school\u2019s ambassador and volunteered at a Korean language school to spread cultural awareness to younger generations, becoming a \u201crepresentative voice\u201d of a small community has shown me the importance of creating a space where all individuals feel heard and supportive.",
            "Question 8": "Last December, I declined my opportunity to attend a university in Korea and decided to finish my academic career at Texas A&M. As I was given the opportunity to attend college near my family members with no financial obligations, my parents and close relatives encouraged me to settle in Korea. Since continuing my studies at Texas A&M had significant ties to my future job, career, and potentially where I settle in the future for me and my family, making this decision was overwhelming. However, by the end of my fall semester at Texas A&M, the experiences and relationships that I made with the people in my FLO and my classes were more than I ever imagined and further reassured me to continue my studies in engineering, in which I truly felt passionate about. Although family has always been my number one priority, I communicated my decision with my parents and decided to appreciate this decision as an opportunity to experience and embrace a new chapter of my life.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for the SEC, I would design a program exclusively for international students. While there are various programs within our college community to better help freshmen become more familiar within our campus, traditions, and career development, there are fewer resources given towards international students to navigate through college. Therefore, I would create a program where international students can experience the social aspect of the college culture at Texas A&M and learn different study methods from current students, including career fair workshops where international students can learn to develop their professional speaking skills and their resume. As the SEC represents the Engineering student body, a program designed to support a small sector of students in A&M will not only provide assistance in their transition into Texas A&M and the College of Engineering but further strengthen a tight community where all Engineering students feel supported."

            "Question 8": "My passion in life is to be an Entrepreneur, especially in the Tech Industry. Being an Entrepreneur involves taking risks through investments. These investments don't only involve money, they also imply investment of the Entrepreneur's time, thoughts, and energy.\nIn my Junior year of high school, I was presented with a small business opportunity, called Food Connect Services, by a friend. Not everyone around me supported the idea of me pursuing this venture. Some of my family thought it was a distraction from my studies, while others doubted the feasibility of the concept. They said it would be short-lived, time consuming and would provide mediocre results at max, and I had a strong feeling this would be the case even before starting the venture.\nRegardless, I ended up pursuing this venture. This was a tough decision for me to make, but I followed through because I was genuinely excited about the idea of having my first business at 15 years of age. My perspective towards this situation was to enjoy the journey and the process, without regard to the results. This venture ended up providing amazing results, but for me the journey, experience, and wisdom I gained have immensely more value.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for the SEC, it would be \"Student Engineers Meet Professional Engineers.\" The main objective of this initiative would be to connect the students and accomplished engineers from different industries who graduated from Texas A&M. This initiative would provide students with direct access to professional advice from expert Engineers from various fields. The experienced engineers would be more than happy to advise and guide a fellow Aggie.\nThis initiative would be carried out through webinars, panel discussions, and in-person seminars. These events would allow students to ask questions, seek guidance, and build lasting connections with former A&M students who have successfully navigated the industry.\nThe impact of this initiative could be massive. It would allow our engineering students to be more informed as a whole, inspiring them to make more effective career and academic decisions. It would also foster a stronger alumni network, opening doors for mentorship beyond the meetings and events held by the initiative."

I have worked to bridge the gap between students and opportunities as the Vice president of the Women In STEM club where I held workshops and invited people with a variety of STEM-related careers to speak about their careers, whether it is through leadership or participating in projects/events. I have always strived to empower aspiring engineers and advocate for their needs, and I recently have joined Itbridge in making that happen through exposing young children to things such as robotics, hardware, and coding in Austin and Chicago.",
            "Question 8": "I had to make the difficult decision on calling out on someone's behavior, although they were notoriously known to be defended by their huge friend group. I couldn't handle the fact he was able to continuously make misogynistic and racist comments, while also singlehandedly avoiding any type of responsibility. I knew that it would cause them to direct their anger at me, consistently attacking me online and spreading rumors to my friends in order to demand my apology towards him, I remained resilient in what I said about his behavior. Which made him even more upset and started also taking it out on our mutual friends, which lead to me defending my friend's name and sacrificing my own image for theirs, I didn't care what they thought about me but my own friends who tried to defend me shouldn't have been brought into their hatred for me. The situation has shown me what friends truly stand for, and who I am as a person. I will always voice my educated opinions and remain strong as to who I am as a person, strong willed and dedicated towards making the right decision whether I like it or not.",
            "Question 9": "I would create some type of mentorship and networking program which connects engineering students with industry professionals and researchers. I am part of the first-generation engineering mentorship program where my mentor is a mechatronics major, she has helped me so much in settling into my first year and what I need to prepare for such as ETAM and career fair but a lot more catered towards me and what I already have for my resume. So something related to establishing people's way into a career or research would also benefit others like it did to me. Many students struggle to bridge the gap between academics and real-world engineering application so this would offer direct exposure to the industry while also fostering professional growth and creating opportunities for more internships, research positions and new career decisions. Which also perfectly aligns what SEC stands for by promoting advancement in professionalism and also increasing awareness both on and off campus."

In high school, I was the Events Coordinator for Key Club, where I helped organize volunteer events for members. This was a valuable experience because, as a member myself, I appreciated how the club made it easy to find volunteer opportunities without the hassle of searching on my own. By participating in these events, I was able to log 100 volunteer hours and earn my Y.E.S. award. It showed me the importance of providing accessible ways for others to contribute to the community, and I\u2019ve carried that mindset with me since.",
            "Question 8": "As the Events Coordinator for Key Club, I was responsible for organizing volunteer events that met the interests and schedules of our members. There was one instance where we had to choose between two events\u2014one was a larger, more popular event with a chance to accumulate more hours, and the other was smaller but had a greater impact on a local charity. After discussing with the team, I chose to prioritize the smaller event, believing it would provide more meaningful, hands-on service. Some members weren\u2019t thrilled about the decision and felt it wasn\u2019t as exciting as the other option.\nI took the time to listen to their concerns and explained the reasoning behind my choice, emphasizing the value of giving back in a more direct, personal way. I also assured them that there would be other opportunities for larger events. In the end, the smaller event turned out to be a success, and many members appreciated the chance to work more closely with the charity. While not everyone agreed with the decision at first, the experience taught me how to lead with confidence, communicate openly, and stay true to my values even in challenging situations.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, I would establish a mentorship program that pairs upperclassmen with underclassmen in engineering. The primary objective would be to help students navigate their academic journey, provide guidance on course selection, and offer advice on career development. By fostering relationships between students at different stages of their education, the program would create a supportive community where individuals could share experiences, knowledge, and resources.\nThe potential impact would be significant, especially for freshmen who may feel overwhelmed by the transition to college life. By connecting with someone who has already gone through similar challenges, they would have a more accessible support system. The program could also promote cross-disciplinary collaboration, as mentors could come from various engineering specializations, exposing mentees to different fields and career paths within engineering.\nIn addition, the initiative would build leadership skills for both mentors and mentees, as the program would encourage active participation, communication, and problem-solving. Overall, this mentorship initiative would strengthen the SEC community by creating a network of support, enhancing student success, and encouraging a culture of collaboration and mentorship."

            "Question 8": "As Secretary of the Student Council in high school, I proposed extending our weekly assembly into our study period the week before a long three day weekend. My reasoning was that by doing so, we could shorten or even skip the assembly the following week, right before finals, giving students more time to study while still addressing important announcements. I believed this would benefit everyone, but my idea was met with resistance from some council members who felt it disrupted the schedule and that the students would complain. Despite the pushback from the majority, our president, who supported it brought it to the head of the Upper School, who also liked the proposal. The result was positive: students appreciated the extra study time, and the announcements were still made effectively. Although not everyone initially agreed, the experience taught me how to be resilient in standing by an idea or solution that may not always be popular at first, not taking it personally when others don't agree, and recognizing that just because an idea isn\u2019t immediately embraced doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad one.",

Once I learned that engineering requires other skills that I can acquire or already have, I became eager to pursue engineering. Spreading awareness about engineering resonates with me the most because I can share information that I wish I had earlier.\nMy experience spreading awareness came from working with the youth advisory council of my city\u2019s local government. Our department came up with a project regarding food deserts and limited access to healthy food for minorities and started a camp for elementary school students to help them find ways to access healthy food. We worked closely with city officials to spread awareness of the project, which helped me learn many things. I intend to use this experience in the SEC, all while gaining more experience with spreading awareness.",
            "Question 8": "A couple of months before graduating high school, I had to choose between Texas A&M and LSU. I was leaning towards Texas A&M because of its strong engineering program, but my parents were leaning towards LSU because of the less competitive environment. My cost of attendance was similar for both universities, which only made the decision more challenging.\nTo help with the decision making process, I created a comprehensive list comparing the benefits and drawbacks of both universities. I suggested to my parents that we could all find benefits and drawbacks of attending one university versus the other, and then compile all of our findings into that comprehensive list. After a few days of comparison, we found that the benefits of attending Texas A&M outweighed those of attending LSU, so Texas A&M would be the better university for me to attend. Now, I\u2019m confident in our decision as I am excelling in all my courses and feel that I am in the right place to help me start a career in aerospace engineering.",
            "Question 9": "When it comes to an engineering career, one of the most important skills needed is public speaking. This is especially necessary in technical interviews and in coordinating a team to create a project and present it within deadlines. Aspiring engineers are already being taught technical skills that will be needed on the job, but a public speaking initiative with a special focus on technical interview preparation and team coordination could give them a huge leg up in their careers.\nThe initiative\u2019s concentration on technical interviews and coordinating teams would be extremely helpful. The technical interview preparation would supplement the mock interviews already provided by the Career Center. This is essential because engineering interviews ask technical questions in addition to questions in a standard interview, so the ability to answer these questions confidently can help aspiring engineers jumpstart their careers. In addition to that, team coordination is essential because engineers work in teams for any kind of project. Knowing how to coordinate a team will be essential to creating high-quality projects and meeting deadlines while effectively presenting them, which is crucial in any job."

Many of my parents siblings and immediate family have stayed in Corpus their whole lives, it wasn\u2019t common for someone to venture out. Moving away from home made them think of the worse scenarios and deep down, I also felt some doubt but I knew the challenge was worth the reward. I sat down with my parents and showed them all of the experiences I can witness, the better education, the networking, the possibilities were endless. With enough convincing I ended up coming to a understanding with them; I can attend if I ensure I make the best of my college experience; I never back down from any opportunity and I challenge myself as much as I can. So now im here; far away for someone who grew up in one place their whole life. I'm experiencing things reshaping the way I think and making memories that will last a lifetime.",
            "Question 9": "After analyzing the current committees, I noticed a strong emphasis on career readiness, such as job placement, company chats, and resume workshops. However, there seems to be a gap on actually providing ways to improve students resumes. I propose creating an engineering challenge program that allows students to work on real world projects provided by companies. By using SEC's current company connections, we could obtain challenges across various engineering disciplines such as designing prototypes, solving complex problems, or developing software solutions. These challenges would not only give students the opportunity to build practical, hands on experience but also enhance their resumes with projects that are directly relevant to their career goals. Furthermore, this initiative could bring valuable networking opportunities, allowing students to connect with companies and potentially opening doors to internships or job offers. By adding this dimension to SEC\u2019s offerings, we would provide students with an impactful way to show real world experience and talent in the fields they're passionate for."

            "Question 8": "During my Eagle Scout project, I faced a challenging decision after exceeding my goal of collecting books for the African Library Project, an organization building libraries in rural Uganda. I had around 600 books sitting in my garage with nowhere to go. As my project deadline approached, my team suggested donating the surplus books to the nearest goodwill center and calling the project complete. However, I believed that with a little more effort the extra books could make a bigger impact. I took the lead in searching for any organization willing to take our books, despite the challenges COVID-19 posed. I met with my team and encouraged them to put in this last bit of effort to complete the project. After reaching out to multiple organizations, we found a group in London, IAHV, that was running a book drive to build schools in rural India. After contacting their representatives, I arranged a shipment of books to their collection point. Though the process required much more effort and not everyone agreed to the idea initially, with good communication and keeping our goals in mind, we were able to successfully deliver the books to a community in need.",

This initiative would encourage students to apply their knowledge to real-world problems, highlighting engineering's impact on humanitarian issues. This initiative would be service oriented as well as competition based. I know that other organizations have other design competitions, however this initiative would follow the theme of serving communities and the environment. For the service aspect, the college of engineering would partner with local non-profits and global humanitarian organizations to allow students to brainstorm and design solutions for problems that these organizations are fighting such as clean water access, low-cost housing, and alternative power generation. Students would have the chance to participate in hands-on projects that have the chance of creating a real impact for people in our community and beyond. The competition aspect will come through organizing design competitions or hackathons centered around the theme of sustainability.

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC mission that most resonates with me is the goal to increase engineering awareness. A great challenge, even for people already in engineering, is really knowing what engineering is. It\u2019s more than just creating Jets for Lockheed or AI models for Nvidia, it\u2019s a way of life that allows people to express themselves through innovations.This connects with what I\u2019ve done in the past when participating with my community's climate change awareness organization, Residents Forward. I was on the student leadership council that planned and ran events in our community, including their bi-annual Youth Climate Summit. For the Youth Climate Summit, we brought in speakers from all fields to talk about their innovations in sustainability to 100 students. I want to continue spreading awareness about climate change specifically, how engineers can make our world more climate friendly.",
            "Question 8": "After three years on the Rowing team, I decided to quit. When I first joined I was in a weak mental state, out of shape and had no discipline. Being on the Crew team was life changing and strengthened my mental state, transformed my body and I gained critical skills of teamwork, routine and consistency. All of which helped me improve my performance at school. During winter practice in my third year, I injured my shoulder and had to sit out. I reevaluated my time at Crew and my priorities. I realized that I accomplished my goals for Rowing and there were other passions and physical goals I wanted to pursue. My mom was heavily against it because she saw its positive effects on me and was on the board of the Rowing organization. Still I decided to leave. I began Physical Therapy and pursued my passions by joining my school's Robotics Club. After PT, I started going to the gym to reach my physical goals and have been consistent since. While rowing was an invaluable experience and taught me useful skills that I apply daily, I realized that knowing when to branch out is key to my personal growth.",
            "Question 9": "A project that I would like to start for the SEC is an engineering festival. It would be an event where we could bring clubs and professors to showcase their projects or host cool science experiments that are interactive with the people at the festival. There would also be live music with local food venders. Anyone can attend the festival if they buy a ticket, and the proceeds will go to a charity of our choosing. This idea is inspired by an event series I volunteered for back home called Live at Five. It was produced as a fundraiser by our local science museum and was a big hit for our town. The purpose of the Festival will be to introduce K-12 kids to engineering, host a fun social event for students at Tamu, give back to the community and whatever charity the ticket sales go to and let faculty and other orgs showcase their work."

            "Question 7": "The professional advancement element found within the Development division of the Student Engineer's Council mission particularly speaks to me as I feel that helping students become ready for real-world interactions and processes is incredibly important to a students maturity within college. Professional development is not something taught to students within school, but rather learned through uncomfortable experiences that students must put themselves in. I am all to aware of this scary first-step that must be taken, having experienced a similar form of professional advancement within my senior year of high school talking to recruiters for college swimming. I had to begin researching teams, emailing coaching staff, and video calling recruiters. This was one of the first processes in my life that I had no direct guidance through, and had to learn on my own. However through this, I gained experience in exchanging with recruiters and weighing important future opportunities.",
            "Question 8": "My family moved to San Antonio the summer before my junior year of high school due to my dads job in the military. Upon arrival, we had to stay in a hotel and wait for available housing on the military base. During our stay within the hotel, I found a competitive swim team that accepted me generously and I also began working as a lifeguard at the same pool I practiced at. I begin to feel comfortable and happy quickly in this environment, however it would not last for long, because once my family would move into the military base, the commute would be too far to my new job and team. Knowing this, I decided to explain my feelings to my parents in the best way I could, to convince them to instead buy a house closer to the pool and high school all my new friends went to. My parents were against it at first, but through showing them my new swim family, job, and recruitment by the high school coach, they were persuaded. As a result my family moved into Stone Oak, and began to enjoy our new community, quickly naming San Antonio our, \"best home\".",
            "Question 9": "I would create a week-long hardware hackathon focused on building and applying an innovation to help children with disabilities in school. Students will be separated into teams where they will brainstorm and create projects that they believe will assist children with disabilities in learning. Instead of competing with one another and having judges in typical hackathon fashion, the project will be more focused on producing a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment as a result of being able to engage with the local community and help those in need. This project allows engineers to gain experience with hands-on applications of hardware, as well as be creative in their projects as the prompt is broad and mainly relies on what the creators believe is a helpful piece of technology for those children. The primary objectives consist of creating a project using available hardware in order to help children with learning disabilities and engaging with community K-12 schools and children to form lasting bonds. Those participating in the project will learn how their own work can positively affect other's lives, and in turn, form a sense of appreciation and pride in what they have created, similar to engineers employed throughout the world."

This aspect has direct influence on the quality of future engineers, which in turn will affect the future of development and innovation throughout the world. The most similar value I have demonstrated is my intellectual curiosity with regard to engineering-related subjects. As I got older, my curiosity and interest grew with me which has led me to pursue the Engineering Honors program. I\u2019m excited to see what opportunities lie in undergraduate research and alternative course work where I know I can develop the skills to satisfy my curiosity.",
            "Question 8": "The decision that comes to mind is one I made during the summer before my senior year. I was working at the same Christian summer camp where I had been a camper since I was eight, and it felt good to be able to give back to the camp and help the younger campers have the same experience I had. Unfortunately the last week of camp conflicted with the start of football practices, which my parents and coaches expected me to attend. Although I knew those practices were important, by this point, I had been playing football every year and was starting to lose my passion for it. And the team would be just fine without me, as I was not a starter. It was a difficult choice because I wanted to make my parents and coaches happy and help out the team, but I also wanted to finish out camp and continue to help the campers have fun and grow in their faith. Ultimately, I decided to stay, and I have no regrets. In the end, honoring my commitment to the campers and helping them grow in their faith helped me do so as well.",
            "Question 9": "A project I believe would benefit SEC would be to have recent SEC alums connected to small groups of active SEC members in a mentorship program. This would entail a monthly virtual meeting and the mentors being available for questions related to educational and professional growth. It would be beneficial to have recent graduates serve as mentors because they have the most recent experiences with job searching and beginning new careers and will have more insight to better guide aspiring students. Ideally each group would have the same alumni act as their mentor for a long period of time so that the students can form a good working relationship with their mentor where they feel comfortable to ask questions. This program would allow students to step outside of a classroom setting and equip them with the tools to learn about the different industry opportunities available to them. I believe a benefit to joining an organization like SEC is having access to a broad network of people and I feel a mentorship program would continue to support and strengthen this network with more promising engineers."

            "Question 7": "SEC's mission to support and serve engineering students and the community resonates deeply with me. I have supported engineering students by becoming a teaching assistant for over 200 students in discrete mathematics. I provided constructive feedback, scheduled homework and quizzes, and maintained open communication. Additionally, I have been a peer mentor for incoming engineering freshmen for the past two years. I supplied knowledge of the ETAM process while simultaneously being a connection of support for students adjusting to college life. Beyond academics, I have given back by assembling World Vision Kits for underprivileged children at local elementary schools in the BCS area, creating dog toys for Aggieland Humane Society, delivering candy for Trunk or Treat, and volunteering at Big Event. Through education and community outreach, I strive to uplift others and give back to our community.",
            "Question 8": "A time when I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with was when I forgave someone that deeply hurt me. Often people tend to believe that to gain forgiveness, you must earn it. My friends were convinced I should act in revenge and get back at the person who wronged me. However, I see forgiveness as a personal choice that brings peace and freedom from resentment. Holding onto a grudge would be easy, but I knew letting go would be more beneficial than remaining angry. I handled the situation by choosing to address the person about the harm they caused and how it had affected me. I had made it known that I had forgiven them, but that didn't mean I would let them walk over me. Although this choice was difficult, the outcome was internal peace with no burned bridges. I was able to preserve a sense of self-respect by reminding myself that forgiveness is not about excusing behavior, but freeing yourself from holding onto anger and grudges.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative or project for SEC, it would focus on connecting engineers with global challenges by collaborating with international organizations. Its objectives would include increasing cross-cultural communication and collaboration, exposing students to global challenges, and encouraging innovative thinking outside of our local environment. This is close to my heart as I have studied abroad and seen the impact of developing cross-cultural communication and interpersonal skills through interactions with diverse individuals. Many students remain in a familiar cultural bubble where their ways of thinking and problem-solving can be limited. Through the application of this program, students can gain a broader and more adaptable perspective to ideas outside of this bubble. This initiative could help students prepare for industry where they will work with people different from themselves and outside of their comfort. This program would not only expand SEC's impact but also prepare students to face real worldwide problems and challenges."

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC mission that resonates with me the most is the part about fostering professional advancement among all engineering students. The primary way that I demonstrated a similar value in my life was when tutoring in high school. While tutoring younger children and setting up an entire career fair are not on the same level, the core value of heart is still shared between them. The reason that I loved to tutor the kids so much was because of the impact that I knew it was going to make in their lives. Getting kids focused on school when they are young will greatly benefit them in the long run and help them reach their goals because some kids need extra learning to thrive that is not provided by public schools. I feel this experience resonates with a value similar to the professional advancement segment of the mission.",
            "Question 8": "There was one time very recently when I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with. This experience happened during my ENGR 216 lab in my freshman year. The problem arose when one of my labmates resubmitted our lab the next day after the deadline, even though our group had already submitted the report on time. This became a big issue because the lab TA took late points from our grade since our report was resubmitted after the due date. This was when I had to decide whether to confront my labmate and then contact the TA to fix the grade, or just let it be. I decided to take the initiative to get a better grade, and I had to email the TA 4 times. Eventually, our grade was fixed for the lab report, which helped me finish the class with an A.",
            "Question 9": "A new project I would create for SEC would be a proposed new committee under the development branch that focuses explicitly on helping engineering students create resumes, LinkedIn pages, and give advice on applying to internships. I would make this new branch to help engineering students apply what they have learned in school to the real world. More specifically, I feel I had no guidance on some of these things coming into college, and looking back, I wish there were more accessible resources there to help me. Henceforth, creating a division that is always there for new and continuing students to go to for advice, I feel, would be very beneficial and would help get more Aggie engineers into the job market doing what they enjoy. The objective of this branch would be to help improve the professional portfolios of Aggie engineers. This could have a great potential impact on engineering students. This may help many more students get the internships they have always sought and dreamed of. The potential of more Aggie engineers in the workforce means a possibility for more innovations to help our society and the world improve overall."

            "Question 7": "Although the entirety of SEC\u2019s mission relates to my engineering experience, I most resonate with being a representative voice for engineering students. Throughout my time at A&M, I have found myself constantly striving to meet new people and gain new experiences, from joining a sorority to embarking on study abroad trips. However, not all of these experiences have involved other engineers, especially those in the biomedical field. Many of the groups I find myself in have different interests ranging from business to medicine. For example, I recently traveled to Cusco, Peru for a medical internship, where I was the only engineering student amongst my peers. I found it fulfilling to share my knowledge with my teammates, and even convinced a younger intern to major in engineering. Despite being an outlier, I always strive to share my engineering experiences with others and encourage my younger peers to do the same.",
            "Question 8": "This past summer I had the opportunity to travel to Yucatan, Mexico to conduct an intensive research proposal with a team of six engineers, both from A&M and Yucatan. One of the greatest challenges I faced was balancing the differences between how each member wished to approach the project. Most of my peers were willing and eager to collaborate as a team. However, there was a member who had a more independent mindset. They would often complete portions of the proposal in a secretive manner, sometimes even deleting others' work and replacing it with their own words. I noticed this discrepancy and proposed to the other members that we confront the situation head on. Several objected to this idea, concerned that it would cause tension or animosity amongst the group. However, I knew if I wanted to preserve the authenticity of the proposal and ensure true collaboration, I would have to address the issue directly. Despite not having full support, I had a conversation with the person. They ultimately were very understanding, and the conflict even brought our team closer. This situation taught me how to handle issues of cultural differences and made me a stronger leader.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create an initiative for the SEC, I would expand the organization to a worldwide scale by creating a study abroad department. This initiative would strive to increase engineering awareness in a global context to current members, A&M students, and even students in other countries. Throughout the year, the department can fulfill this objective by making the current abroad opportunities offered at A&M more known, whether it be through social media or in-person meetings. Annually, the SEC can launch their own abroad trip, allowing current members to gain global competency while deepening their passions for engineering. A portion of the trip can focus on encouraging students in disadvantaged areas to pursue an engineering career and outlining what it means to be an engineer. Another portion can focus on expanding the knowledge and experiences of members. SEC can partner with a local university in the country of interest and organize different labs, activities, or facility tours that shine light on areas of interest that members might not have previously been exposed to. Traveling abroad has changed my life in many ways, and I feel the same can happen for students who are given the opportunity."

Picking a major was stressful but exploring engineering when I went to tour A&M really solidified my desire. A&M is open to helping prospective students become aware of engineering which was such a great experience. I have demonstrated a similar value in my life through contemplating how valuable an education is. My parents work so hard to give me the best education and I feel like people are not aware of how amazing it is to be able to study and explore engineering. I work hard in school because I am aware of how significant and impactful engineering is and I would love to help bring engineering awareness to others. SEC would be such a great opportunity for me to implicate my passion and be a positive impact on my community.",
            "Question 8": "A difficult decision I had to make was deciding between UT Austin Engineering and Texas A&M Engineering. Getting into both was a relief but this decision weighed on me for several weeks. I had so many different people telling me that I should go to this school over that school. I handled this situation not by blocking out other peoples\u2019 opinions, but utilizing their advice and comments to form my own conclusion. Ultimately I picked A&M because of the solidarity of the Aggie network and the appeal of general engineering. General engineering allows room to become aware of all engineering opportunities, setting a foundational path for future careers. Exploring the different engineering fields from this campus sets tamu apart. Even though not everyone agreed with my decision I had confidently listened to and retained their advice and carefully picked the path that I felt best suited for; and I have not regretted my decision. This experience taught me to carefully evaluate decisions that have big impacts. SEC is such a huge organization that is so inspirational to thousands of students. I want to help make decisions that will help students the most.",
            "Question 9": "I would create something similar to an online community platform for first semester freshmen engineers. Being a freshman engineer was honestly so confusing. You feel thrown into college and have to navigate engineering with no one holding you accountable. General engineers don\u2019t have a specified advisor which also makes you feel more alone. I would create an optional organized group chat where there is an experienced student engineer who can be like an older sibling to a certain number of freshmen that they are assigned; someone the students do not have to be as formal with and who they can be comfortable asking random questions to as well as receiving ETAM tips. Having a student-to-student connection would make the freshmen more comfortable and successful. Another idea I have is a semesterly student panel with selected students from the different engineering majors that can answer questions freshmen have on specific majors like the coursework etc. Hearing from the students in the specific majors would be very beneficial for the freshmen."

I strongly believe in the importance of collaboration and professional development, as engineering is not just about technical skills but also about having real-world impact which can only be done through communication and networking. I have demonstrated this value in my own life by organizing study groups to prepare for exams and fostering a strong network of peers where we support and learn from one another. By creating an environment of collaboration and shared knowledge, I\u2019ve helped ensure that we all have the resources and encouragement needed to succeed academically and professionally.

            "Question 8": "One of the most difficult decisions I\u2019ve made was converting to Orthodox Christianity from Islam. It was a deeply personal choice, rooted in extensive reflection, but it came with significant challenges. Many of my childhood friends, people I had known for years, distanced themselves from me, and others who were once close began to look down on me. It was painful to see relationships change in that way, but I never held any hard feelings towards them. I understood that my decision challenged their perspectives, just as theirs remained important to them.\nDespite the isolation I experienced, I stood firm in my beliefs because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s right to change one\u2019s values based on circumstances or external pressure. Rather than letting resentment take hold, I chose to respond with understanding and respect, keeping the door open for those who still wanted to maintain a friendship. This experience tested my resilience, but ultimately, it strengthened my character and deepened my appreciation for genuine connections built on mutual respect. It reinforced my belief that true integrity means standing by what you know is right, even when it means losing your close relationships and the sense of belonging you once had.",
            "Question 9": "One initiative I\u2019d create for the SEC is an engineering peer mentorship and collaboration network.This program would connect underclassmen with upperclassmen who can help with coursework, career advice, and adjusting to the challenges of engineering. It could also encourage students from different majors to collaborate on projects, giving them some hands-on experience working across disciplines. On top of that, it could offer networking events, resume workshops, and mock interviews to help students prepare for internships and jobs.

I used to be a Class Officer for my High School, elected to a body of 7 students who were meant to best represent the interests of all 700 of the students in our class. We would plan events like prom and homecoming, design aesthetics, speak at ceremonies and talent shows and much more. In a way we were prime examples of what it meant to be a student at the school, and it\u2019s something that I think I can carry with me to A&M and SEC and try to be a great example of an Aggie Engineer and set the standard high.",
            "Question 8": "This past semester me and a group of friends participated in the SEC\u2019s Ignite Design Challenge where we had to design a realistic rocket landing simulator. We planned on signing up to get the benefits of research experience and an insight into the Engineering process. However, a big problem that arose is that this project was of a varying priority among our members. Some had it at a high priority while others thought that it wasn\u2019t as difficult and wouldn\u2019t be worth the effort. Knowing that we all needed to be on the same page for this, we had a conversation. I told them that if we sign up for something like this, we should give it our all, otherwise we shouldn\u2019t do it in the first place. Their view was that finals were coming up and their time was better spent studying for their classes. I searched for common ground, and we worked out ways that everyone could contribute as much as they could to the project while also not getting in the way of their own responsibilities. We were all happy with the final result and our individual contributions, and we landed a total score of 285/300.",
            "Question 9": "One new project that I would create for the SEC is a Cultural Development initiative. The goal of this initiative is to promote the idea of inclusion in the College of Engineering of different ethnic and cultural groups. As I\u2019ve spent more time around Engineers I\u2019ve grown to meet some really cool people from different backgrounds. As a person of Mexican descent, I\u2019ve been able to bond very well with other Hispanics, even joining SHPE. But I think there is a bit of a barrier between different cultural groups in Engineering, and I think that the SEC could help these people share their unique stories among each other and hold events like cultural exchange retreats, networking nights, and other social events to help foster a strong international community right in College Station. Something like this could even help attract companies who want to connect with strong engineers from a specific ethnic background, increasing SEC\u2019s professional reach. I think it would also be good in bringing passion to Engineers, those who strongly care about their roots. Then the SEC\u2019s representation of all engineering students would become even stronger and more welcoming to anyone that is interested in helping this new initiative."

            "Question 7": "I resonate most with the SEC\u2019s mission to serve engineering students by fostering professional advancement, as I believe hands-on experience is the most impactful way to learn and grow as an engineer. The SEC has directly benefited me by providing professional opportunities\u2014I secured a great co-op with Johnson & Johnson after interviewing at the 2024 Spring SEC Career Fair. Without the SEC\u2019s commitment to career advancement, I likely wouldn\u2019t have discovered this opportunity. I also embody this value through my volunteer work with a local STEM outreach program, where I introduced 1st and 2nd graders to engineering concepts. By simplifying complex ideas and incorporating hands-on learning, I aimed to spark their curiosity and lay a foundation for their growth in STEM. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of mentorship and career development, aligning with the SEC\u2019s mission to support the development and future of engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "When deciding where to attend college, I had the option to stay in California near my friends and family or move to Texas to go to Texas A&M. Many of my friends strongly believed leaving was a bad idea, saying I would regret being away from the beaches, the mountains, the perfect weather, the opportunity, everything. I had to make a choice that I knew would impact my personal development, future family, and future career. While it is easy to choose what is comfortable, I knew I had to prioritize doing what I felt was right, even if it was uncomfortable in the short term. I handled the decision both logically and emotionally. Emotionally, I weighed the decision by tuning out the noise and tuning into my inner voice. Logically, I wrote out all the pros and cons and considered the tradeoffs. Looking back, making the move has been one of the best decisions of my life. Texas A&M is a place where I feel at home. The life altering decision to come to A&M has taught me the value of making difficult decisions based on a mix of gut feeling, considering opportunity cost, and seeking the uncomfortable.",
            "Question 9": "I would create the Youth Outreach Program to spark curiosity and raise awareness to kids about engineering by \"learning by doing\" through hands-on learning experience and mentorship. Many children aren't aware of the opportunities within STEM, and early exposure can start to build interest. This program would connect SEC members with local College Station and Bryan schools to engage with students through engineering activities, demonstrations, and teaching.\nThe program would focus on making engineering concepts accessible and engaging to younger generations by doing things like building simple machines, coding basic programs, and conducting experiments. It would also create mentorship opportunities where SEC members could share their experiences, knowledge, and answer questions. By instilling a passion for problem-solving and innovation at a young age, the program would help build a pipeline of future engineers while strengthening SEC\u2019s connection with the community. Further, this project would allow SEC members to develop leadership and communication skills by teaching complicated engineering concepts in simple, fun ways. Overall, the program would have a lasting impact on both the students and the volunteers involved."

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC mission statement that resonates with me the most is the engineering awareness pillar. This part of the mission statement truly stood out to me when I served as a FLO counselor. While interacting with engineering students in my FLO, many of them told me that they were unaware of the various branches of engineering and opportunities available that both college and future careers had to offer. I made it my goal to share information and show them the different engineering opportunities, hoping to help them explore all that engineering has to offer.\nI believe that in today\u2019s rapidly evolving world, engineering awareness is more important than ever for students. With the increasing diversity of careers and specializations, it\u2019s essential to connect with aspiring engineers, and to provide them with access to the many opportunities available within the engineering field.",
            "Question 8": "After the COVID pandemic, I was able to be a percussion section leader for my high school band. One issue that we faced after coming out of the pandemic, was that our skills and abilities were not as sharp as they were before the pandemic. Even though we were back to normal practices, I knew that we were not going to reach our goal to be performance ready. My other section leader and I decided to host extra practice sessions for our section, in order to get to the level that we needed to achieve.\nAs you can imagine, many people were not completely on board with extra practice, and some were even upset. Due to this, we ended up adding more social elements to our sessions to be more interactive and enjoyable to go to. We decided to take a break in the middle to have a chat and snack session, as well as to invite the section to a group dinner afterwards. With these changes, not only were we able to improve our skills and abilities, but made many memories and closer friendships as well.",
            "Question 9": "One Idea that I have for a new initiative is to combine the goals of DI Saturday with a more friendly and less daunting approach for freshmen engineering students. When I was a freshman, I remember going to DI Saturday trying to figure out more about the majors I was interested in. One thing that I do remember, was that some of the sessions felt stressful and long. Given that I attended some of the more competitive majors\u2019 sessions, it still was hard for me to fully enjoy the information and talk with some of the presenters.\nTo fix this, I believe that making available a more relaxed form of DI Saturday for freshmen students can help them feel more comfortable in learning more about the different majors. Having representatives from each major to have a booth or mini presentation area with a more coffee chat vibe can help bring many more benefits to students. These small, more chill learning opportunities can help students stay engaged with information they want to hear, as well as allow them to have more in-depth conversations with department representatives. To still track attendance, sign-ins and short essays will still be implemented."

I appreciated the fact that new ideas are able to flow around on campus while getting students together, building up a positive environment, and teaching students about how to organize events and tasks through a council structure.\nIn my personal life, I believe I have demonstrated a similar concept through my role as vice president of the Technology Student Association in high school. From my freshman to senior year, I recognized the club's lost potential. Gradually, I worked to organize the club more effectively, ultimately enabling it to participate in national competitions.",
            "Question 8": "One of the most important things I've learned through holding leadership roles in High School is that with being in these roles, espeically President, you have to typically make decisions that arn't always appreciated. An example of this occurred in National Honor Society when, as President, I had to set aside my personality to be friendly with everyone and accept that there were rules that needed to be enforced. After multiple warnings and emails of not turning in hours, or not submitting the honor code or even going against the honor code, I had to make the overall desion to remove members. When it came down to ordering sashes for graduation, those same members tried to order one and I simply just had to deny their order. This caused turmoil because it wasn't necessiarly easy for those members to explain to their parents or take off their resume but it was a decison I had to make because of my integrity and the role that I was in. Overall the outcome wasn't any severe situation but it caused a bit of resentment amongst memebers.",
            "Question 9": "An idea that I've had for a while was trying to do a concept of having a week for each engineering discipline, where you could have companies come in, just students talking about their experience, or socials with that major. An outline of what this would look like would be where students can explore the different engineering disciplines, and although it's important for freshmen because they would be able to explore the different engineering disciplines, it would be good for students who have already ETAM'd as well because there would be events specifically for people already in that major. For example, on the SEC Instagram, I saw a post about Aviation Week in the fall, and I really appreciated, as an aspiring aerospace/aeronautical engineer, that there was a week specifically for Aviation. However, my concept would involve all sorts of events, and while it would be busy to plan something every week for different disciplines, we could utilize clubs and students in those disciplines; for instance, \"Aerospace Week\" could be partnered with SFTE (Society of Flight Test Engineers) for a more hands-on experience day and another Aerospace Leadership club for a more leadership concept."

All my life, I've been a hard worker, having started working when I was 13 years old. I've also always been interested in engineering, having taken 3 years of engineering in high school and being vice president of the National Technical Honor Society at my school for 3 years. When the career fair came around last semester, even though I'd only been in college for about 2 weeks, I decided to go. I ended up loving it, even getting invited to P&G's invite only happy hour and being hired at Toyota for an internship this summer. I think it's important to be willing to put yourself out there, but many engineering students are afraid of doing that. I love that SEC encourages and empowers students to be proactive professionally.",
            "Question 8": "During high school, I was a captain of my cheer team. Our competition routine was very difficult, and there were certain aspects of our routine that weren't consistently working due to the difficulty. After many long discussions with my coach and co-captain, we agreed that it would be best to change these difficult portions of the routine to be simpler, much to the dismay of many of my teammates. The members of the team that were affected by the changes were very upset, and felt insulted because they felt like we were saying they weren't capable of doing certain skills. Although it was hard to make my friends upset, we felt it was best for the good of the team as a whole. The result was that there were many less injuries during practice and due to excessive amounts of stress on bodies. We ended up going to UIL state finals that year and winning 2nd place in the most competitive division, and getting an invitation to compete in nationals, in which we placed 16th. Overall, I believe the decision was for the best, even though it was very difficult to make at the time.",
            "Question 9": "I would love to create some sort of initiative involving outreach to local schools, particularly elementary and middle schools. Texas A&M has so many bright minds in engineering, it only makes sense to share this knowledge and passion with the next generation of our local community. My current idea is to pair university students with younger students to serve as a sort of mentor figure. The younger student could conduct their project, whether it's a science fair project, independent study, some sort of engineering class project or anything of the like more or less independently, periodically consulting with their paired mentor for next steps and incrementally submitting milestones recapping their progress for their mentor to review and comment on. I believe this could help to spark passion and a love for engineering in the younger students. The university students would get the experience of mentoring, which is a rewarding experience in and of itself, but would also look great on resumes and teach invaluable management and \"soft skills\"."

            "Question 8": "During my internship with the City of Austin, my team was tasked with building an app to benefit the city\u2014all with a tight budget of just $500. My role was to develop a backend database that was coder-friendly, easily modifiable, and budget-friendly. I sought advice from my mentors, who suggested various technologies like MongoDB, SQL, and AWS. However, none of these options met all my requirements.\nWhile brainstorming, I noticed my teammates using Google Sheets to track \"checkpoints\" during a presentation, and that sparked an idea. My dad used to call such resourceful solutions \"jugaad\"\u2014a creative hack to solve a problem with limited resources. When I pitched the idea of using Google Sheets as our database, my teammates were skeptical. They argued that it wasn\u2019t \"professional\".\nTo make my case, I reminded them of Google\u2019s origin story\u2014how they famously used Lego bricks as the casing for their first server. I saw Google Sheets in the same light: a pragmatic solution. I knew the only way to earn buy-in was to demonstrate its effectiveness. I spent countless hours implementing the solution and preparing a presentation that highlighted its simplicity, functionality, and cost-effectiveness. Eventually, I won over my teammates, and the idea was adopted.",
            "Question 9": "I would create a department that would help students with little to no research experience to get connected with professors to assist them. As a freshman, I've found difficulty finding professors who are willing to take a freshman under their wing given our lack of knowledge and experience. I think this is extremely detrimental to both the college and the student, as students miss out on valuable experience that would help A&M's own research programs as more students are accustomed to researching, helping it attract more talent."

Before actually coming here (TAMU) and getting to interact with engineers one on one, I had assumed that engineering was one of the more boring fields of education-but now, with some experience, I know that engineering is by no means \"boring.\" Thanks to the information of others, I was brought out of my ignorance. Similarly, I used my position as secretary of my NHS chapter to make my school aware of orgs in need of volunteers, like KABOOM (who builds playgrounds) so they could continue doing their work.",
            "Question 8": "Just before senior year began--and to the chagrin of both my mom and dad--I decided that I wanted to get ahead of saving before college began and get a part time job. Both of my parents protested in the name of school being my number one priority as well as free time. To \"debate\" these protests, I made sure that I could independently transport myself, and that my work schedule was to have non-negotiable rest days, and that my school schedule was to be more lax than the previous year of eight AP courses. After presenting my reasoning for saving money and the methods for my work/school/life balance, my parents allowed me to get the job I desired. It only took me a few weeks to know I made the right decision; not only did I learn much about real world business, I managed to save a considerable amount of money to support the necessities of my college life (food, gas, etc.) whilst simultaneously making friends I still keep in contact (even six months after leaving). In hindsight I recognize my parents' protestation benefitted me as it gave me an opportunity to strengthen my resolve and prosper in my pursuits.",
            "Question 9": "In light of my recent conversations at the Spring 2025 SEC Career Fair, I feel many students would benefit from a conference in similar style to DI Saturday but, instead of learning more about course material and degree planning, representatives from each engineering major gave presentations on the actual applications of their major in real-world engineering. I think inviting pre/post ETAM students to attend conferences specific to their (desired) major--where they can learn about what skills they will need upon joining the workforce as well as learning about what knowledge/experiences are useful--would better set up students for choosing their major and/or seeking opportunities to set them up better for career opportunities. The purpose would be to help pre-ETAM students make a responsible decision as well as to lead post-ETAM students to pursue the cultivation of skills/experiences required for their major's field. If a conference could do these things, then fewer engineers would find themselves dissatisfied with their career as well as become more successful in their career search."

While this may not be the case for all engineers, I found this to be an issue with me as I tend to hide behind my academics. It was not until I got a job at a local boba shop in my hometown that I was able to improve my customer interactions, teamwork, communication, and even leadership skills.

            "Question 8": "When I was the secretary of my church's youth group, we had this fundraiser where we sold hoodies with a custom logo. When our fundraiser chair brought the plan to the committee, while the plan was good, I thought that there needed to be a major increase in the quantity initially purchased. While we had sent out an interest form to gauge the amount of product we would need, I felt that the number was not fully representative of the demand we initially assumed. However, the issue became that if we were to order more, it would not only cost us more but also it would delay the fundraiser almost a month. While this is far from ideal, I pushed to order more merchandise as I truly believed that it would be worth it. While it did slightly set us back, the extra hoodies became worth it as we sold everything within two weeks, forcing us to make another order and even make a sufficient profit from this event. Honestly, this time was truly stressful as I made an executive decision over my committee but I am so grateful that it worked out in the end.",
            "Question 9": "One project that I would introduce to SEC is a LinkedIn/Resume Speed-Dating event, where students can meet one-on-one with recruiters or Aggie alumni to receive personalized feedback on their profiles and resumes. This event would provide students the opportunity to refine their professional portfolio, gain insights on how to make their applications more appealing to recruiters, and build confidence in their networking skills. I believe that this project allows for meaningful and focused interactions that allow students to receive guidance from a professional level, similar to a mentor. Additionally, if the program continues, I hope that alumni return to the event as industry professionals, creating a cycle of mentorship to benefit future Aggies."

I\u2019ve also contributed through volunteering organizations such as Circle K International, of which I\u2019m fortunate enough to be an officer here at A&M, and by helping with volunteer projects my parents have hosted at their workplace.

My parents are both doctors with one being a pediatric dentist and the other being a pharmacist, and I had based most of my early years in high school around that idea so it wasn't later in my high school career that I decided to go into engineering more specifically computer science. My parents would criticize my decision as they were worried about my future career as they believed the field was too oversaturated for me to go into and cited my previous experience working with them. However, I decided to continue with computer science as I knew no matter the outcome working in software would make me the happiest. Months have passed since then and I have already had much early success with my choice as my dedication to my craft has allowed me to win over 500 dollars through coding competitions, meet many people with similar interests as me, and have even had success in finding internships in a time where it has become difficult to find work in the space.",
            "Question 9": "I would like to see something similar to JP Morgan's Code for Good, reflecting my enthusiasm for competitions like hackathons and background in philanthropy it would be a great mix of both worlds. Similar to Code for Good, the competition would have a philanthropic theme and give engineers from all backgrounds the ability to come together to try and solve a problem brought forth by said theme. For example, one year the competition could be beach-themed and competitors would try and come up with solutions to problems they might see in said theme such as ocean pollution. The objective would be to try and elevate engineers' problem-solving skills much like the ignite program but it would allow all years to try and come up with an effective solution, more results-focused than development-focused. This would allow engineers to come together, improve their professional skills, and with the help of SEC's outreach, hopefully bring engineers closer to professionals and each other. Majors like computer science already have these types of competitions through hackathons so an event like this would bring competition in engineering disciplines that might not usually get opportunities like this."

Though I feared harming our friendship, I felt it was important to share my concerns, as I could see how much the relationship was negatively affecting him.\nTo approach the conversation, I avoided all direct criticisms I had and instead encouraged him to reflect. I asked questions like, \u201cWhat do you like most about her?\u201d and \u201cWhat are your biggest concerns?\u201d so he could assess the relationship himself rather than feel pressured or hurt by my opinion. My goal was to offer support while being honest about what I felt.\nAt first, he didn\u2019t take my concerns seriously, but later, he admitted that my words helped him approach the relationship with caution. Although I risked our friendship, I valued honesty more, especially when I believed something was wrong. In the end, this experience strengthened our friendship and we both realized the importance of accepting the truth, even if it is hard to hear.

            "Question 8": "During the F1 in Schools World Finals competition, there was a very critical decision regarding the aerodynamics of our car. There were two competing approaches: a light, low-drag design favored by most of the team, or an adjustable wing system I believed would provide an optimal performance across different conditions in races. This adjustable wing system required more time for testing and introduced additional complexity, to which some of my teammates were somewhat hesitant.\nAs Team Principal, the call was mine. I led a data-driven discussion where simulations presented showed that our design for an adjustable wing could provide a 5-7% speed improvement in variable conditions. Despite concerns, I advocated for a small-scale prototype test to validate the concept. When they saw the results, the team got on board, and we were committed to the new design.\nThe result? Our innovative approach impressed the judges, reduced overall drag, and helped us place strongly at the World Finals. This experience has taught me about the balance required to lead while collaborating, use data to justify decisions, and confidently take risks even in the face of opposition.",
            "Question 9": "I would propose introducing AggieSec: A Cybersecurity Awareness and Professional Development Initiative under the development division in the SEC. AggieSec can bridge the engineering students and cybersecurity. The Initiative will develop core technical competencies, industry linkages, hands-on experience in students, along with fulfilling SEC's mission related to professional growth and awareness for engineering.\nAggieSec would provide interactive workshops in the field of penetration testing, cryptography, secure coding, and ethical hacking to show the real-world applications of cybersecurity. Industry partnerships with companies such as IBM, Lockheed Martin, and NSA would be established to bring guest speakers, mentorship, and internship opportunities for engineering students. Additionally, the semesterly CTF competition should inspire students to apply their learned skills in an engaging and competitive environment. AggieSec would work with students from computer engineering, electrical engineering, and IT to incorporate security best practices into hardware and software projects, respectively, allowing for interdisciplinary collaboration.\nWithin the engineering community, AggieSec will further increase engineering awareness, prepare students for cybersecurity careers, and reinforce the role of the SEC in professional development. That is, it aims to make Texas A&M engineers current on security issues, hence more competitive in the modern technological world."

Having been the past president of MSA at my high school, I tried to involve students in social activities, work for student needs, and make an environment friendly for everybody. Throughout my time at Texas A&M, I continue this way of thinking through engineering organizations, peer interaction for project collaborations, and academically contributing to a diverse and supportive environment. Leadership to me is not just a title, but it's to take the lead, stand up for others, and affect growth. I attempt to help fellow engineering students be successful, whether through mentorship, teamwork, or professional development opportunities. I am very excited to continue this mission and make an effective contribution to the Student Engineers Council as well as the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 8": "At Idea Lab Kids, I was allowed to conduct some coding projects, including modding in Minecraft. Whereas the kids should have done the same task-for example, to make a working mod, I allowed them more latitude to do it their own ways. Instead of coming up with step-by-step instructions, I encouraged them to try different ideas, such as changing the properties of an item or adding a custom texture while still ensuring the rubric was met.\nAlthough other colleagues sometimes voiced concern that this more flexible approach might lead to projects unfinished or wrongly executed, I felt the creative ownership had to be with the kids. In this instance, I was of the opinion that they would be far more interested in seeing their projects to completion if given the creativity to do as they liked, having applied problem-solving skills to begin with and so making more imaginative mods. Hands-on, creative problem-solving not only let them learn more about the concepts of coding ,but also kept them thrilled to learn and experiment.",
            "Question 9": "I would institute a program at the SEC that gives students real-world engineering exposure outside of their lab classes to round out their educations with practical skills relevant to solve real problems. Workshops would include but were not limited to hands-on PLC programming, circuit troubleshooting, industrial motor control, CAD modeling, and PCB design. Unlike traditional lab classes, these workshops would allow students to use equipment in an environment without the burden of graded assignments.\nComplementing these would be open lab sessions where students can practice skills in an independent or peer-to-peer technical project environment. Students will be mentored by industry professionals and faculty mentors in applying best practices and problem-solving strategies to the projects they will be involved with. In addition, students during weekend build sessions and in project-based competitions will be asked to design and prototype solutions to real engineering problems. This would provide students with additional opportunities for hands-on learning outside of regular coursework, enhancing their confidence, technical skills, and thereby making them more competitive for both internships and full-time employment. It would help guarantee that Texas A&M engineers enter the workforce better prepared by way of hands-on learning and in collaboration with industry."

            "Question 8": "During my high school engineering class, my team and I were tasked with designing a product of our choice. We picked to design an electric motor that could be attached and detached from a regular skateboard. While designing the mounting system for the motor to the board my team was torn between putting screw inserts into the board which would be used to screw in the motor bracket or using a clamping system that would clamp the motor bracket to the tail of the board. This posed a difficult decision not only because I was the deciding vote but also because these designs were so drastically different that there could not have been a compromised design. I planned to take an unbiased approach by asking each side a set of questions to understand their design's user-friendliness and durability. This allowed me to gain the information needed to explain to the side that I didn't go with as to why the other side's design would be more beneficial for the overall goal of the project. The outcome was positive with both sides feeling heard and understood why I went with my decision.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative/ project it would be to establish communication and public speaking workshops. This is because I believe it is beneficial for not only people who previously didn't have experience, but everyone to learn and practice their abilities in these areas, with the objectives of teaching critical communication and public speaking skills such as how to properly introduce oneself, effectively convey ideas, how to use proper tone and proper body language. I believe this would help to build people up and into more confident people who would have the ability to convey what the Student Engineers Council represents to people who are unfamiliar with the student-led organization. In addition, the skills learned would be applied to interviews, team projects, and/ or networking events."

            "Question 8": "In my high school Physics C class, my lab group was tasked with determining the acceleration of a falling object using a ramp and motion sensors. Halfway through, we realized we had inconsistent data. While my group thought that we should continue, I felt that we should restart to ensure accuracy.\nPhysics C was notoriously tough, so it was understandable that my group feared running out of time. Although my group was frustrated with me, I convinced them to redo the data. I devised a plan to maximize our efficiency in hopes that we could finish by the end of class.\nDespite my group's best efforts, we were not able to finish. My group was clearly frustrated with me, and I felt bad about my decision. It made me think that maybe I should have listened to my group and continued with the inconsistent data. However, the teacher saw how hard we were working and gave us an extension to collect the data. This experience taught me that when making decisions you need to be comfortable with the fact that it may upset some people, but with good execution and confidence you will often arrive at a good outcome.",

For me, running allows me to connect back to my body and release stress, and I want other students to experience that as well.\nA 5k run could also prove to be a great bonding experience for students. I have met many of my friends through running, and one of the main reasons for this is that focusing on something outside of school allows us to better relax and be ourselves. A fun run would allow the engineering community at A&M to be more connected as well as boost mental health.\nFinally, a fun run would serve as a great fundraiser. While it serves as a great way for students to relieve stress, it would also provide the SEC with funds to further create amazing projects and initiatives that would help future engineers."

When we discovered that our robot's weight distribution was incorrect, compromising its stability, I had to make a difficult choice in how we would move forward with the manufacturing of our parts. Due of time restrictions, several teammates wanted to go with our current design, but I felt that performance would suffer if we didn't make any changes. Despite opposition, I pushed for a redesign that included redesigning parts and machining new ones. Although it was a tough decision, testing revealed that our robot's enhanced balance made it more nimble and dependable in competition.

SEC would identify major student problems every semester, such congested study areas, difficult campus navigation, or sustainability concerns, and then assign teams to provide engineering-driven solutions.\nOne project might, for instance, use IoT sensors and a mobile app to create a real-time seat availability tracker for libraries and study spaces. Another could concentrate on creating a bike rack system that is optimized using modular, space-efficient designs in order to improve campus transportation. Teams with an emphasis on sustainability could install solar-powered charging stations in strategic locations throughout campus.\nTo ensure genuine effect, these projects would be developed with feedback from campus services, professors, and students. Teams might demonstrate their prototypes to university officials at a final demonstration, which would increase the possibility that they would be implemented. This project would immediately improve the Texas A&M student experience while offering practical experience."

So far in my academic career, I have actively sought opportunities to enhance my professional skills and support my fellow students in their development as well. For example, I organized and led study groups that not only improved my understanding of complex concepts but also created an environment to be able to collaboratively learn. Furthermore, my time as a CNA has allowed me to witness first-hand the healthcare environment. I have seen real-world challenges and medical technologies used that have helped me better understand and apply the principles I have been learning in my classes to make me the best biomedical engineer I can be. My passion for both self-improvement and collective advancement aligns with the SEC's mission to support the professional growth of all engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "While working as a CNA in a local nursing home facility, I noticed that a resident's pupil was much more dilated than the other eye. I immediately recognized this as a medical emergency, possibly a neurological issue, and alerted the nurse. Because I had not been working as a CNA there for a long time, the nurse brushed off my concern and claimed that I had most likely seen wrong or was exaggerating the dilation. I insisted that the dilation was alarmingly large yet the nurse still brushed me off. It was at this moment I remembered that during my training, I was told that if my higher-up was doing something unethical, it was my duty as a CNA to go to the next level in the chain of command. So, I alerted a physician and told them about the resident's situation. It was then that the physician confirmed the resident was experiencing a serious medical condition. The resident was then quickly escorted to receive the care she needed.",
            "Question 9": "I would create the Engineering Interdisciplinary Integration Program, a collaborative program that brings together students from various majors, including engineering, to work on real-world problems presented by universities or companies. The objective of this would be to host events where teams of students from various majors tackle problems together. This would encourage students to learn from other's expertise and disciplines while fostering communication, teamwork, and problem-solving they might see in the real world after graduating. The EIIP would allow participants to see the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration while gaining practice experience in applying their skill sets to real-world scenarios. Another idea I had was to create the Vertical Integration Program, where university students work with middle or high school students to teach basic engineering principles through hands-on projects using LEGO Mindstorm robots, or other similar methods. University students would be able to develop mentorship skills by leading workshops to guide younger students in building and programming while teaching them the fundamentals of engineering. This would not only reinforce university students' learning by teaching but also inspire younger students to pursue engineering all while building the local community. The VIP would bridge the gap between higher education and the community."

At the end of the year, I calculated my student\u2019s final grades using their homework, quizzes, and exam grades, and I had a list of students, from highest performing to lowest. The top three students of each class get a trophy and a certificate commemorating their achievement. When I presented my list to the teacher, however, I was met with disagreement, as he believed the students in the third and fourth positions should\u2019ve been switched, considering the nature, motivations, and attitudes of each individual student. I believed that those were subjective and that the ranking should be based solely on numerical reasoning. After much deliberation, we decided on his ranking. We agreed that while grades are important, intrinsic qualities are also valuable as they attribute to what makes a great student. The top three students overall demonstrated that they deserved it.",

SEC students would serve as volunteers by handling registration, check in/out of all participants, passing out refreshments and snacks along the route, and offering verbal encouragement to all. The objectives of this project include: encouraging active lifestyles by hosting a marathon where participants can run, jog, walk, or a mix of all, exploring the huge campus of Texas A&M University by having the marathon route go through Northside to Southside and everywhere in between, and fostering positive relationships with the people in our community by opening this event to all. This project can create a positive impact as it encourages people to focus on or better their health and meet new people, it shows participants the beauty of campus, and SEC members can have an opportunity to grow closer with their SEC peers, even those that are not in their same committee, by volunteering their morning to help with this marathon."

We raised a lot of money and had a lot of participation, but we had several safety concerns and had to spend a lot of money to host the tournament. I decided that my officer team would vote on this, and since there were 9 officers including me, a result was certain. I was the last to vote and I decided to vote against having the tournament making the vote 4-5 against the tournament. The officers who voted for the tournament raised several concerns and were very unhappy about the decision I made.

            "Question 8": "The most difficult decision I ever made as an Intramural Official came in my second semester as a flag football referee, officiating the last playoff game of the night. One team brought over 100 members of their organization to cheer them on, packing the sidelines. As fate would have it, the game went to double overtime, with one play left to extend the game from 2 yards away. From my position, I watched the quarterback throw to the end zone. The defensive back was in tight coverage against the receiver, with a hand on the receiver's hip. When the ball arrived, it fell through the receiver's outstretched arms to end the game, and the season, for the team.\nAll at once, fans of the losing side surrounded me, demanding Pass Interference on the defensive player. Insults, bottles, and slurs were thrown at me as I was trapped in a sea of angry fans for almost 10 minutes until I was pulled out. It would have been easy to change the call to avoid the eminent threat, but I watched the receiver the entire way. I never wavered, knowing that upholding my personal integrity was more important.",

There are many project competitions that already exist, some with exorbitant budgets and many with extreme complexity. However, this competition would be much more like the EnVision Conference that SEC puts on for K-12 students to discover engineering. It was problem-solving challenges like these that captured the imagination of our young engineers, and these challenges can also be applied to remind our students why engineering is a profession like no other. With a set supply and tool list, engineering students could compete to build the tallest spaghetti tower, or attempt to make the slowest open path for a marble to roll down a posterboard. The solutions would likely be far more creative than what we came up with as kids, and the return to simplicity allows students to marry their inner kid with their inner engineer."

I explained to them how the drum line being unprepared for competition would negatively impact the entire performance and bring the other sections (who had been working hard to memorize their music) down. Though the drum line didn't like my decision, they all showed up and worked hard at the practices I assigned, and we never dragged the band down again.",
            "Question 9": "A new project for the SEC that I would create would be: \"A Day as an Engineer.\" This program would allow the opportunity for engineering students to spend a day shadowing different engineering companies. This program would be offered to all engineering students, regardless of their year, but the biggest impact would come from the freshmen participating in this program. Allowing them to spend a day at an actual company without the commitment of an internship, or having to wait until the summer after they've ETAMed would allow them to actually see how jobs in different sectors of engineering actually operate and help them decide which type of engineering would suit them the best. And, for non-freshmen students, this opportunity could help them figure out what to specialize in for their specific major. Overall, I feel like it would be a great learning experience for students and be a smaller commitment that more people can take advantage of."

            "Question 7": "SEC's mission to promote engineering awareness resonates with me the most. I believe that engineering is not just about technical skills; it is also about collaboration, problem-solving, and making an impact. In my own life, I have seen how working with others on problems creates better solutions. For example, in group projects, I make sure to intentionally listen to what my team members have to say, contribute my own ideas, and use everyone's perspectives to make a decision that solves the issue. Whether it\u2019s completing in-class projects or brainstorming ideas, I believe that working in a collaborative environment creates stronger solutions because it allows people to build off each other\u2019s ideas and learn from each other. SEC creates an environment that encourages students to connect, learn, find opportunities, and grow together.",
            "Question 8": "One of the most difficult decisions I made was switching my major from chemistry to engineering. When I started college, I felt pressure from both myself and those around me to follow the pre-med path. However, after my first semester, I realized that I couldn\u2019t see myself pursuing a career I wasn\u2019t passionate about. To handle this, I researched different majors, explored how engineering aligned with my interests, and talked to my advisors to make sure that I was making an informed decision. Although the process took time, I ultimately made the switch. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. It allowed me to pursue a field that is interesting to me and challenges. This decision has taught me the importance of adapting to change and thoughtfully making decisions.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new project for SEC, it would be a challenge in which teams would create sustainable solutions to campus and community issues. Teams could focus on areas like energy efficiency, waste reduction, and waste reduction. If possible, these ideas could be presented to industry professionals that could judge and implement these ideas. The objective of this challenge is to engage students in problem solving, teamwork, and promoting sustainability. This would push students to become leaders while also helping advance their professional and technical skills."

That belief continues with me, and one aspect of this is how I help some youth who I know. Though they are only slightly younger than me, many of them have not thought of their futures until now; so, I encourage and help them whenever I get the chance. For most of this, I was telling them how to learn from the mistakes I made during my time here at A&M, and how they can take advantage of opportunities in front of them. I hope I can continue to support them in seeking a higher education and in their careers. I want to be able to do the same for my fellow Aggies and aid them in reaching their vibrant futures as engineers.",
            "Question 8": "I have been fortunate enough to not have needed to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with. When I am working in groups and need to make a decision, I consult those involved and try to ensure everyone is involved in the decision to ensure understanding of one another and avoid any possible conflict. However, in those circumstances, I would not consider any of those small choices \u201cdifficult decisions.\u201d In times when I need to make a difficult choice, I take a step back and try to see all the angles and possible outcomes. A time when I followed this was when my family was deciding on putting my family dog to sleep. She was old and contracted a nerve disease that barely let her walk and made one eye blind. The disease would eventually make her blind completely and paralyzed, not wanting her to suffer more, I recommended she be put to sleep. My parents were initially in disagreement, but my input helped guide us to the right choice. Two days later she went to sleep. Though the loss hit us, we were eventually able to move forward, now agreeing that it was for the best.",
            "Question 9": "A new project I would create for SEC would be a new online site that acts as a center for the most prominent programs and software used in engineering fields. The site would host in-depth tutorials for components of programs for engineers (Solidworks, MATLAB, etc.) along with cases in which these tools are used. An example program could be Excel with a lesson on pivot tables. It would show the features of a pivot table and explain their usefulness in the real world. The site would not be a replacement for the teaching of the programs, but as something to increase understanding or show features not commonly known. The hope of this would be that the lessons it provides will eventually allow students to confidently place these programs in their resumes and use them in the workforce skillfully. I came up with this concept from my lab experiences, as I and my peers often searched the web on how to perform certain functions in programs we were using. I believe a site like this would be better than students scouring the internet on how to use these programs and allow insight and how to use them to their fullest."

I believe in this case the term \u201cprofessional advancement\" really refers to helping people grow and learn, and that is what I am truly passionate about. I think the best example of this from my life would be helping the lower classmen in my high school tennis team when I was the tennis captain. After we were done with practice we would shower and do homework until the end of first period, and one of the most rewarding things I was able to do my senior year was help the other people on the team with their homework or what classes they should take as they were planning their schedules. I had no benefit, but to this day it still fills my heart with a feeling that I can\u2019t really describe. But I always loved doing that.",
            "Question 8": "The very first general meeting of the Senior Class Officers after I had been elected Senior Class President of my high school was \u201chijacked\u201d by the rivaling student council group: Parliament. In this meeting lots of people from both sides had previous drama which severely inhibited our goal of working together on our school\u2019s Senior Sunrise. After that meeting lots of people from the Senior Class Officers wanted to blow up the event and not work with parliament. I did not agree and furthermore thought that we should work with Parliament on even more projects due to their man power and resources. To give credit, the \u201cspeaker of the house\u201d (vice-president) of parliament found me and apologized for the meeting since he was not present, but I accepted and apologized myself for our actions in that meeting. It was not easy, but we managed to sit our two organizations down and work together to set up Senior Sunrise, and many other events later on that year. In the end, lots of people on the Senior Class Officers did not agree with my decision. But the event ran smoothly thanks to both organizations and that is what really matters.",
            "Question 9": "I have been really interested in the idea of a \u201cwhat I wish I knew as a freshman\u201d database. I know that most of us would probably like to forget a lot of the struggles that happened freshman year.. But there are so many valuable lessons that do not have to be learned the hard way for these incoming freshmen. This idea can have many different outlets. There could be SEC monitored forums for Q&A, sections on how to find other resources given by TAMU engineering, lists of classes and helpful YouTube channels and outside resources to not only learn content but also get more practice with the content (for example Professor Leonard for calculus classes). But my original spark for this idea was excel. I believe that having a video bank of excel classes to help freshman students learn the basics and the power of excel would help them so much for their chemistry and physics labs. You are \u201csupposed\u201d to have competency in excel from high school, but most do not. It is such a simple, but powerful fix that I believe could really help freshman for years to come."

Introducing skills that allow students to grow their network and technical ability is something that I love assisting in. As the external vice president of SASE, I have implemented similar opportunities for our members, from company networking events to technical workshops. During the first company event, I realized why I ran for the position I did - to see others succeed through the opportunities I provided. There is something heartwarming about seeing others achieve their goals, and I love knowing that I aided their efforts, no matter how large or small my involvement was.",
            "Question 8": "Last year, I was the sponsorship coordinator for a career fair hosted by Texas A&M\u2019s SASE chapter. During this time, I led a team of six in outreach efforts, but would often run into roadblocks while connecting with industry professionals. At one of our meetings, my team was debating between continuing with our LinkedIn outreach or pivoting to more personal connections. The topic arose because we were seeing minimal success with our current outreach and a majority of the team thought it would be a better use of our time to find connections through family and professors on campus. I knew that going the personal route would potentially result in a higher yield of contacts, but there was a track record of success with LinkedIn. After deliberation with my team, I ultimately decided to continue with our LinkedIn approach because of the connections we had, as well as the success we had already seen thus far. This was a tough choice to make because my team was dead set on switching outreach methods, but the next months proved the choice to be correct as we were able to acquire five new companies for our career fair.",
            "Question 9": "Mentorships are key for personal growth. They provide us with knowledge of the industry, tips and tricks, and establish a network that we can leverage later in our lives. I have seen a large impact from mentorships. In my freshman year, I was partnered with a senior mechanical engineer who would advise me on classes, professors, and organizations. Later on, I was accepted into a Boeing mentorship program, where I met biweekly with a propulsion engineer, who would tell me about the niches and days in the life of such a role. That mentorship expanded my insight and helped me narrow down the fields I want to pursue. That is my vision for SEC: to not only give the engineering community exposure to various industries but also to provide them the opportunity to connect with leaders in the corporate world on a personal scale. The idea is that it would be available to gold+ or diamond sponsors, with employees varying from upper management to traditional engineering roles, who are assigned to applicants through an online form. The mentorship can range from a semester to a yearly length, but the frequency of meetings can be decided by each mentor/mentee."

That is why the part of the mission of SEC \u201cfostering professional advancement\u201d resonates most with me. I believe the aspect of career search is a critical component of what it means to be an engineer, but isn\u2019t taught in lecture or in a lab. I have taken upon myself to pursue my internship search, resume building, and networking my sophomore year, and have learned a great deal of what it means to be an engineer outside of the classroom. Professional advancement is an aspect that is self taught, but the aid SEC gives truly makes a difference.",
            "Question 8": "Over winter break, my best friend accidentally hit a woman on a scooter while turning at a stop sign, and called me and my friends for help. She didn\u2019t want to get her parents involved out of fear of punishment, but the lady didn\u2019t want to get insurance involved either. However, the situation quickly escalated when the lady began to threaten her, show up at her home and request money in advance for medical attention she needed. My friends all encouraged her to do as the lady requested so that the situation went away, but I believed in handling the situation the right way. I encouraged my friend to get her parents involved, file a report, ask for receipts of medical bills prior to payment, and to get insurance involved. While my friends disagreed with me, I stood my ground. My friend did end up following my advice, and her situation was resolved. I believe this is an example of standing for what I believe in, which is taking responsibility and following the appropriate steps to tackle a problem. Despite external factors maybe pressuring me into taking shortcuts, I have the determination and passion for doing things the right way.",
            "Question 9": "The work and efforts SEC does for freshmen engineering students really stands out to me and I feel like the efforts should be continued for each grade level. As a freshman engineering student at the time, I truly appreciated the impact of DI Saturday and Industry night. I feel I was exposed to majors and career paths that I wouldn\u2019t know about if it weren\u2019t for those events. However, simply choosing a specific engineering major is just the beginning of what it means to be an engineer at A&M. I believe similar mandatory events for sophomores, juniors and seniors should be hosted by the SEC, corresponding to skills that each grade level should have to be successful in the professional world. For example, for sophomores, a mandatory event in the fall and spring such as a resume workshop (for both resume building and how to write a resume) and a \u201cselling yourself\u201d workshop (to recruiters/for social skills) should be geared at helping sophomore students begin their internship search. These would be mandatory events that would be aimed at helping students be successful in the professional world and hopefully increase Texas A&M\u2019s sophomore student internship securement rates."

            "Question 8": "A time when I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with was when I was part of a research lab, and my group had to decide how to analyze the data we collected. Some members wanted to use a simpler, quicker method, while I believed a more thorough but time-consuming approach would yield more accurate results. They argued that the simpler method would save time and still provide useful insights, but I was concerned that we might overlook important details or draw inaccurate conclusions. To handle the situation, I explained my reasoning and showed examples of how a more in-depth analysis could provide better insights. I also listened to their concerns about time constraints and suggested a compromise, we could test both methods on a small portion of the data first to compare results. After running both analyses, the group saw that the more detailed approach revealed patterns the simpler method missed. In the end, we agreed to put in the extra effort, and our final results were much stronger because of it. This experience taught me the importance of balancing efficiency with accuracy and finding ways to work through disagreements with logic and compromise.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an SEC Mentorship Program to connect underclassmen with upperclassmen mentors in engineering, providing guidance on academics, internships, research opportunities, and career paths while fostering a stronger sense of community within the SEC. As a freshman, I had very little guidance on navigating the complexities of the engineering program and balancing coursework with extracurriculars like research and internships. Having a structured mentorship program where freshmen and sophomores are paired with juniors and seniors based on their major and career interests would be incredibly beneficial. The program would include monthly mentorship sessions covering topics like resume building, securing internships, and managing coursework, along with networking events where students can connect with industry professionals. This initiative would not only help underclassmen adjust to the challenges of engineering at TAMU but also give upperclassmen an opportunity to develop leadership skills and give back to the SEC community. Over time, it would create a cycle of mentorship, where mentees eventually become mentors, strengthening the engineering network and ensuring future students have the support they need to succeed."

After seeing the value of forming close bonds with older students, I think that the SEC could greatly enhance the freshmen engineering experience through a mentorship initiative. Titled \u201cEngineering The Future,\u201d this semester-long program will be designed to help freshmen engineering students gain a solid support system and learn of career opportunities in their specific field of interest. After being admitted, each participant will be asked about their career goals and matched to a group of 5-8 students with shared interests, led by a member of the SEC. This small group, low stress setting will allow new students to get the chance of forming solid networks with their fellow students and mentor. Additionally, because SEC members are some of the most qualified engineering students at TAMU, the field specific career advice the new students will receive will allow them to get ahead professionally. By adopting \u201cEngineering The Future,\u201d SEC would make a huge impact on the next generation of engineers."

I solved in by listening to everyone's ideas, checking previous trials and errors, discussing with the captain, and providing the concise solution to the team. This took time but it helped everyone feel valuable to the team and motivated the team to efficiently. We got really close o beating the T.U. team (GHOST) at VEXU robotics 2024.\nThus, I believe the key to solving a problem is to listen, draw from experience, being patient and a team player, and efficient implementation.\nApart from VexU, I have solved many other conflicts with team members slacking off.

We can have something like the physics fair.\nApart from the engineering fair, I would suggest having more socials with appreciating the advisors and professor with new events. Like writing letters to professors at the end of the year.\nWe can have professor come talk to us regarding lunches or have lunchWProf so they can educate out on their research, courses, and share their experience. This will help us learn and help different majors get exposer to different fields of science\nOn the social aspect, A trip to a theme park or field trip will help the students relax with all the stress of engineering workload. This will help the retention rate of the club and will serve as something to look forward to. However, in order to go you must fulfill extra points in SEC."

At the start, when the club was first founded a year ago when I was a junior, we were all motivated and we got a lot of work done on the game. However, with the start of the new year came issues: no one was motivated any longer. The dedication to the game that the members had was long gone and the effort we had put in long forgotten. I was left with two options: continue down this road, hoping to get the game to a state of rolling out, or revamp the entire club. I chose the second option. I knew that our initial game plan was no longer working, so I decided the club would focus on a new horizon: game jams.

            "Question 9": "I would try to create a new project to allow freshman engineers to get hands on experience with each field of the engineering. While there are many opportunities to learn about the technical aspects of each discipline of engineering, there aren't many opportunities to learn about the fun side of them. Therefore, I would propose maybe a few weeks of quick, fun engineering based activities to spark interest into students. For example, for computer science, we could host an event that would have students code a simple program so they can understand the wonders of coding; for electrical engineering, we could host an event where students could build circuits; for chemical engineering, we could allow for some basic chemistry. The goal of this initiative would just be to allow students to really dip their toes into every major because choosing which one they'd like, allowing them to make a more well-informed choice for their future. This could potentially impact a lot of students that are uncertain about what they want, or are simply unaware of all the options that exist out there, and allow them to get a full taste of what engineering has to offer."

            "Question 7": "SEC dedicates their events to being a voice for engineering students and this resonates with me as a female engineer. It can oftentimes feel discouraging to share ideas to a male dominated crowd, and I initially encountered this when I participated in the NASA Blue Skies competition. This competition tasked us with designing an aviation device that aided in natural disaster relief. We met with large groups of undergraduate and graduate engineers and although intimidating at first, it was inspiring to witness female engineers lead the conversation. The entire community encouraged diverse perspectives. After experiencing this feeling of insecurity, I made sure to vocalize it when I peer tutored underclassmen. Regardless of their race or gender, underclassmen are also prone to self-doubt. Through SEC, I will be determined to foster initiatives that foster a similar environment to the Blue Skies team to make all engineers comfortable to voice their opinions.",
            "Question 8": "It was difficult to choose to attend Texas A&M instead of a college closer to home. In their opinion, a college degree was the same everywhere and a college closer to home would be more convenient and cheaper. To me, Texas A&M aligned with my career goals and graduating from the College of Engineering here would lead to more opportunities. I had conversations with them about perspective, and although they had their doubts, they understood. Presently, they have seen how much I have learned and accomplished at A&M, so I have proved to them, and to myself, that I made the right decision.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative or project for SEC, I would implement takeovers by professional engineers on the SEC Youtube or Instagram. SEC would reach out to professionals in different engineering fields and ask them to film a video of a day or week in their life. The purpose of this would be to inform undergraduate students about the daily operations of different careers. This would also be particularly helpful for the freshman that have not gone through ETAM."

            "Question 7": "The statement that resonates with me the most is \"fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students\". As an engineering student, I understand the importance of gaining experience outside of the classroom. It's common knowledge that gaining technical skills is only half the equation to being a successful engineer, as the other half is properly applying your knowledge in industry through proper collaboration. As a member of my high school band, I spent the summers between sophomore and senior year providing lessons to middle schoolers who wanted to continue playing in high school. It was incredibly fulfilling to watch them grow more confident in their abilities and continue to flourish even after our lessons ended. Similarly, being part of an organization that strives to empower students and places them on the past of best opportunities would allow me to grow as both an engineer and a human.",
            "Question 8": "As a section leader in my high school band, me and my colleagues were tasked with overseeing the trumpet section and making sure that we're were consistently improving. After a particularly bad performance one week, the directors called us into their office to discuss our section's performance and our thoughts on it. Following this conversation, they encouraged us to start holding weekend sectionals to get in some extra practice. After the meeting, me and the other members of the leadership team talked about what we wanted to do, with the general consensus being \"No, I don't want to wake up early on the weekends\". Despite their reluctance, I knew that this practice was necessary if we wanted to do better at our next show. Even though it wasn't the popular choice, I chose to hold the weekend sectional, telling everyone that while it was less than ideal, it would be worth it when we place higher at our next competition. For the first few weekends, less than half the section would show up to the meetings. However, attendance increased each week leading up to the show, which ultimately led us to improve as a section at our next competition.",
            "Question 9": "I would choose to implement a competition in which students from all engineering disciplines compete against each other to create environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions to prevalent problems. I would design it to be a semester long affair rather than a few weeks. I've always been interested in learning about how the development of technology can contribute to environmental degradation if not done properly. It's important to promote the idea that technology itself is neutral, but its impact is dependent on the development and application. Teams of students made up of multiple engineering fields would collaborate to design solutions to proposed sustainability problems such as water conservation and energy efficiency. Each team would be paired up with a knowledgable SEC leadership member who would guide the group and provide advice when facing potential roadblocks on their project. Near the end of the semester, all groups would take part in an expo in which they will present to representatives from industry, leading to the possibility of further development and implementation on and off campus. This initiative can lead to the creation of environmentally conscience solutions with an impact beyond the Texas A&M campus."

It is important to constantly push engineering awareness so that events such as the EnVision Conference will have a positive impact on kids looking to go into the STEM field. For many people, the idea of the STEM major is always associated with grueling work, but through public engineering events, people can also see the wonder and possibilities within STEM. I have demonstrated this value by constantly helping and offering advice to other engineers around me. In high school, I would take time to help my underclassmen when they would have bugs in their code. In college, I spent portions of my winter breaks tutoring for highschoolers struggling in their STEM classes.",
            "Question 8": "During a summer internship, I was the lead for an API Refinement team where we were building out a simple web scraper to pool data into a database for model training. Eventually, we ran into an issue where a different website was found to have much more data than the website we were already using. During a meeting, this newer website was brought up and we had to consider if it was beneficial to restructure all of the code around the new website, even though it would take more time than we planned. As the leader, I chose to stay with the older website that we already had the code for. I made this decision because the company was a small startup, that already had a few investors interested, but lacked a completed program. I explained to the team that moving to the new website would be something we would work towards in the future, but for short term, rolling out a simpler program would be better for the company's business. The outcome was that we were able to launch the program on time instead of lagging a month behind trying to catch up.",
            "Question 9": "The goal of a good project for the SEC is that it is easily accessible to any student that wants to attend. This aspect makes it hard to create anything too specific that would need to limit the number of people attending. My idea is to create a STEM resume/LinkedIn review team. STEM students would be able to send in their resumes/LinkedIn and a team would do a brief review and send comments back to the student. I propose this idea because I have reviewed plenty of my peers' resumes and a majority of them are unsure how to format a certain section or how to express a project that worked on. This leads to them completely abandoning that part of their resume since their problem is so specific that the internet can not help, and I have struggled with this exact same issue. The goal of this project would be to raise the quality of students resumes so they feel more comfortable submitting applications and going to the career fair."

            "Question 8": "In OA, we send out emails to the chapter to promote events and information regarding the chapter. I was the Chief, and I received an email stating that the individual has received to many emails. At the time, major events were coming up that needed promotion to ensure good attendance. I was advised by a few youth leaders that it would be best if switched to social media communication. There was a valid concern of the quality of outreach. If we switched and relied on them for promoting these events with 200 followers with the district having 600+ members, this would not be beneficial. I decided to send a poll seeing who liked emails and who wants social media communication. There was a tie. The final decision was continuing emails to maintain greater outreach contacting all 600+ members in addition to starting the social media accounts and utilzing them to communicate with the chapter. Currently we use both methods of communication and the adult that had an issue with the email communication unsubscribed to our emails. The outcome for the events, we exceeded well in attendance and added on to our communication methods that we still use to this day.",
            "Question 9": "The SEC is a great council with many resources and outreach. An initiative/project for the SEC I would create is to find a way to strengthen this outreach by introducing an initiative that allows freshman/prospective engineering students to understand what the SEC and Engineering is all about. An event or project where these students would have the opportunity to begin practicing on how to network, how to build connections and how to start working towards applying for a job at Career Fair in addition to allowing these students to understand the mission and purpose of the SEC. The Engineering World is vast with many opportunities, this would be an objective to add ease to the students as they transition from student to profession. The other objective would be to focus this outreach on students who don't know where to start or are struggling to discover their career path to allow us to bridge the divide between concern and confidence. This would have potential impact because not only would it help a lot of students who are in this situation, but it will allow the SEC to take part in helping these students work towards a smooth transition towards their career."

Setting myself and others up for success is a value I do my best to uphold on a day to day basis through any situation. Whether it be helping my friends or roommates with homework, convincing them to not skip the gym when they shouldn't be skipping, or even just helping them relax and/or go out after a long week (because balance is important) - I believe there's a reason why we're here for these four years and we need the make the most of it. While I know I'd benefit from the SEC, I believe I can also benefit the members as well.",
            "Question 8": "The transition from middle school to high school comes with its own set of challenges - as change always involves some sort of challenge. However, this period for me came with a different set of challenges as well. Coming in I wasn't exactly sure where I'd even go to high school, as there was just so much on the table at the time. My parents were set on me going to a private school in my area, we had gone on a tour previously and knew family friends who went there that had only good things to say about it. However, one of my teachers encouraged me to apply to this magnet school in my city that focused its curriculum on science and engineering specifically. I looked into it, went on a tour with my robotics team later and eventually applied. At first, my parents weren't on board and it took some convincing. I did a deeper dive into the school's curriculum, resources, and spoke with people who went there to learn more about it. I eventually presented all of this information to my parents, and they eventually agreed to let me go - best decision I've ever made.",
            "Question 9": "One thing I would create isn't an entirely new initiative on its own, but more of an addition to the already existing engineering development program that hosts DI Saturday and Industry Night. I'd create another event in a similar format to provide more information about graduate programs/doctorate programs in engineering and/or MBA programs to current undergraduate engineering students - this would mostly be targeted towards undergraduate juniors and seniors but any engineering student interested would be welcome to sign up. The main objective of this would be similar to that of DI Saturday and Industry night, except focused on development through studies beyond an undergraduate degree. Instead of speakers from companies like Lockheed Martin or Texas Instruments coming to tell us about what their company does, you'd have administration and admissions officers from our grad school come and explain what graduate school is like and how it may benefit us later down the line. Panels of former and current grad/PhD students could have Q&A sessions during these events to share their own experiences as well. An event like this would hopefully allow people to clarify their career paths and introduce these programs to students who may not know about them."

The largest event hosted by this organization is the TAMU Physics and Engineering festival hosted every April, in which the entire department comes together on family weekend to bring joy to those visiting. I have participated in multiple events as a demonstration aid, and am currently working on developing new physics demos for the public to enjoy. Therefore, It is safe to assume that I most resonate with SEC's dedication towards public outreach. I appreciate the time and care that SEC puts into their events to make the world of engineering that much more enjoyable.",
            "Question 8": "Senior year of high school provided many opportunities for me to explore and develop my professional background. Most notably of these opportunities was the aero science course, an in-depth course based on the research and development of rockets. As my groups team lead, I oversaw the entire construction process, including our major accident. The electronics bay, a system designed to be removable for data recovery, had become lodged within the body of the rocket; in our attempts unremovable. In the process of trying to remove the bay, a major fracture occurred within the body of the rocket, rendering it unusable. I was then faced with two options: attempt to salvage parts and stay within our budget, or push over budget to have a more stable and functional rocket. With deliberation from my team, I ultimately decided to push over our budget. Pushing the budget puts more strain on our finances, but ultimately saves on time; we didn't have to modify our design, which would've been costly on an already tight schedule. Ultimately, our work on the rocket paid off with a successful mile high launch.",
            "Question 9": "SEC so far has many initiatives that serve a wide variety of purposes: the career fair for networking and internships, Engineering Day for outreach, and Industry Night presentations for field knowledge to name a few. It is fair to say that SEC serves the engineering field well in terms of these programs. One aspect I do believe could be expanded on is the concept of family engagement. That is, most of the time, parents don't get the opportunity to see the hard work that their children are putting in to their careers; there is no singular event dedicated towards the sharing of new technology. My Idea is to have an event similar to Industry Night, only instead of professional companies presenting for around an hour, it's student organizations presenting their work. The event would give students the ability to practice their presentation skills, while at the same time showing off their work to their relatives. It also gives student organizations the opportunity to show out more than they would in events such as MSC open house. In summary, an event dedicated to the presenting of technology developed by students gives chance for growth in the engineering community."

However, I was soon mistaken when the workload for my required courses became apparent. Despite spending countless weekends on the third floor of Evans, my efforts weren\u2019t enough. After receiving a particularly poor test grade, I found myself browsing the transfer requirements for Mays Business School. This wasn\u2019t a hasty decision; I consulted with my parents and met with advisors to discuss the best way to transition from engineering to business. Both friends and family encouraged me, whether to stick with engineering or switch to a less rigorous major. In retrospect, engineering now seems like the only path for me, but at the time, I saw valid reasons for both options. Engineering proved to be incredibly challenging. I had hoped my hard work would pay off, but after test after test, it became clear that math and science were not my strengths. With my entire family in business and easy access to future internship opportunities, switching seemed like an attractive choice. Ultimately, I decided to finish what I had started, and after a year, I\u2019m glad I did.",
            "Question 9": "There is untapped academic potential in impoverished areas across Texas.

This led to many engineers being unemployed, and a lot of my friends when I said I wanted to be an engineer said that I would end up working as an Uber driver(common destiny of many engineers). After moving here I was surprised at how engineers were so well regarded, and how much support I had in high school from my teachers and even my friends, which led me to the place I am today.

There were also the many downsides of not speaking English and having to leave everything I knew behind for something uncertain. Still inside me, I knew there was something waiting for me, and that not taking this opportunity might make me regret it for the rest of my life. Going against my family, I took this opportunity, and I can happily say it was the best decision of my life. I grew so much as a person, and it was all due to getting out of my comfort zone. My relationship with my family (especially with my dad) is definitely not the same; still, those are things I can work on.

The winner would have the privilege to project his idea and implement it. The SEC will provide assistance throughout the whole project. The objective of this initiative would be for engineers to take a more practical approach to their aspirations. At the same time, showing that these projects being implemented are ideas of a student will motivate other students that also want to have that kind of impact in our community. It also gives us another chance to give back to our community, which provides us with so much. It would also be an opportunity for integration within the SEC since more than one department would be necessary to run such a big operation."

These workshops could also bring in other engineers who have experience working in large-scale teams and have them describe their tips for communicating ideas to others in diverse professional environments. Additionally, leadership and project management skills could be taught to help Aggie engineers who want to work in upper-level management roles. The incorporation of this program will make Aggie engineers so much more prepared to communicate their ideas to multidisciplinary teams and clients."

Putting our engineering knowledge and well-deserved degrees to use can only be done if we put ourselves in the right light. We must prepare ourselves for the professional world to help advance our societies. Giving consistent effort and being courageous will land you where you belong. My resourcefulness has allowed me to approach challenges creatively, both personally and in engineering. Just as I once turned ordinary items into something exciting as a kid, I now use this mindset to solve complex problems with the resources available to me. Additionally, I make the most out of any situation and always try to learn from my mistakes and my practice. This is exactly what SEC offers through its various events: learning experiences that enhance our professionalism and prepare us for the world.",
            "Question 8": "In 2007, my family and I adopted our dog, Lucie. She was a wonderful companion, always full of energy and love. However, as she aged, the years began to take a toll on her. By the beginning of summer, my parents could barely sleep through the night without her waking them up with loud panting, sudden frantic behavior, or accidents on the carpet. Her joints had weakened so much that she struggled to stand or run. Despite her physical struggles, Lucie remained the same loving and friendly dog she had always been. She never had bad intentions\u2014she simply wanted to be the same playful dog she had been all her life. However, she required supervision and special care. With summer approaching, our family had vacations planned, and the difficult conversation about putting Lucie down arose. We had recently lost our cat, making the decision even harder. We loved Lucie deeply and couldn\u2019t decide if it was the right time. As a family, we sat down to share our thoughts. Ultimately, we decided that after 15 wonderful years, Lucie had lived a full life, and the best decision\u2014for both her and the family\u2014was to let her go peacefully.",
            "Question 9": "My new initiative for SEC, called OS Aggie Advantage, would be to familiarize students with different operating systems. Many people are closed-minded when choosing an operating system, often believing that Windows is the only viable option for engineering students because that is what they are told. However, different operating systems have their own pros and cons, and understanding them can help students make more informed decisions based on their needs as engineers. This initiative would include workshops, lectures from industry professionals, and comparison guides covering Windows, macOS, and Linux. Important things to be covered include software compatibility, performance, security features, and customization potential for engineering applications. By exposing students to multiple operating systems, this initiative would encourage adaptability and problem-solving. It would also prepare students for the professional workplace where many different operating systems are used. This would make our Aggie Engineers more versatile and competitive in their careers. Students who do not prefer Windows will feel more included and heard by their advisors and peers. Overall, this initiative aligns with SEC\u2019s mission to equip engineering students with the knowledge and resources to succeed in a growing technological world."

            "Question 7": "The philanthropy mission of SEC speaks to me the most. During my time in high school, I worked as a camp counselor. I would organize and plan science experiments for kids from kindergarten all the way through middle school. We taught them the science behind basic aerodynamics, elephant toothpaste, and paint bombs, and then we let them experiment with them. Seeing their faces light up with joy was by far the best part of the job. What resonated with me most about this experience was seeing these kids throughout town, at the store or perhaps a soccer game, and they would immediately jump into some story about how \"science time\" was their favorite part of camp. Hearing that they found \"science time\" more fun than the swimming pool or the Wii, really spoke volumes to me. I would love to help with outreach with local schools through SEC.",
            "Question 8": "My team was working on coding a Pok\u00e9mon game, when we arrived at a crossroads. In order to help with data management, one member of the team wanted to put all the data into one file, however, I thought that it would be best to create two files, one to keep up with candy management and another to deal with caught characters. This was a difficult decision as there were benefits to both. Ultimately, I decided to continue with my idea of creating two files. I was able to show my teammate that if we wanted to progress the game further, having too many components on one file would lead to more issues and more debugging concerns whereas the increased storage from one extra file was relatively minimal. After talking with the team, and showing off prototypes of the two models, I was able to convince the team to go with my idea. This paid off later when we decided to add leveling and battling to the game. We would not have been able to do this nearly as easily if we had decided on only using one file.",
            "Question 9": "I would love to host an engineering camp during spring break for elementary school children. This would give the children something exciting to look forward to over spring break, while allowing parents to stay at work. We could have multiple different learning opportunities and experiments for the children throughout the week potentially utilizing the learning studios in Zachry and maybe even the laboratories. This would show the students a glimpse into college life, while simultaneously showing them the joy of engineers. They could see some of the real lab work that engineering students do daily, and also have a chance to participate in their own experiments. Additionally, this would help show them the culture of Texas A&M and the great community we have here on campus. Doing this over spring break would allow us to utilize many spaces that are normally swarming with students. Logistically, I know we face the challenge of having enough students stay over break, but I'm sure with some convincing, there will be more than enough SEC members willing to help out, even if they are not necessarily involved in the philanthropy committee."

What elevates an engineer from good to great is their capacity to properly articulate innovative ideas with clarity and passion, transforming abstract concepts into tangible solutions. This skill fosters collaboration, inspires shared vision, and drives meaningful progress. From a young age, my father introduced me to conversations about physics, art, and philosophy, teaching me to think critically and express complex ideas in engaging, accessible ways. This interconnectedness of technical and creative ideas laid the foundation for my ability to communicate and understand effectively. It also inspired me to bring the same clarity and passion to conversations with peers, whether discussing academics or arguing about art. These experiences reinforced my belief in the power of communication to connect minds and turn ideas into reality.",
            "Question 8": "In one of my classes, we had a group project to code a game using Python. Despite having ample time, we naturally procrastinated until the last two days, leaving us with a half-baked concept, very problematic code, and no research on the unkown part of the execution. On the final day, we realized our original concept required learning an overwhelming amount of new Python coding, which still might not work. At 10 o'clock pm with barely 14 hours until the deadline, we were in a state of panic. However, after an appropriate period of participating in the panic, I regained my composure and made the painful decision to scrap our idea entirely and start over with a completely different game concept. Initially, everyone was uneasy, even the most experienced coder, who was hesitant to let go of our progress. However, in this moment of uncertainty, I could see that this was the only way to complete the project without our game being a complete bore. At the end of the day we got it done in time and the game we coded was fun but the true reward was the experience of mental clarity in a time of despair.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative for SEC, it would be a program called \"Engineering in Action\"(working title), designed to give engineering students, particularly freshmen and undecided majors, the opportunity to shadow engineers in various fields throughout a typical workday. This initiative would feature both online content (for example: vlogs, day in the life videos) and inperson experiences, where students could visit workplaces to observe engineers in action. Each engineering discipline would be represented, showcasing the diverse roles and responsibilities within each field. The primary objective is to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world application, helping students visualize their future careers. By seeing the physical manifestation of their studies, students can better understand how theoretical concepts translate into practical work. This clarity would empower them to make informed decisions about their majors and career paths, while also inspiring passion and confidence in their chosen fields. Additionally, the initiative could help students identify potential internship opportunities and build professional networks. Students would gain a clearer sense of direction, reducing uncertainty and increasing motivation. This initiative could also strengthen ties between academia and industry, fostering collaboration and innovation."

In my life, I\u2019ve been dedicated to keeping a high GPA, I\u2019ve applied to internships and been invited to interview, I\u2019ve sought after opportunities to work with professors on projects, and I\u2019ve attended career fairs to understand what each field\u2019s recruiters are looking for. These pursuits all bettered my understanding of what the professional world is like. For example, the interviews I\u2019ve done have prepared me for each subsequent interview as I\u2019ve come to understand what is expected in the preparation process for internships. I believe professional development is the process of investing in oneself to be able to excel in the professional world, so using this definition I know I demonstrate this pillar of the SEC\u2019s mission statement in my life.",
            "Question 8": "A difficult decision I\u2019ve had to make was my decision to not pursue college athletics. I had competed in swimming since I was 7 years old and I always told myself I\u2019d continue doing so through college. Everyone on my high school team, along with my coaches, thought I would swim in college and many people were quick to ask why I would throw away my swimming career since I had strived so hard in high school to be the best I could be while being highly recruited. I faced a lot of backlash from my head coach in particular, as he thought if I was just able to get through the slump I was facing towards the end I would come out on the other side better off. I realized however that this wasn't the case as I was no longer swimming because I wanted to. Instead I was swimming for the validation of others, which was a fleeting feeling. I felt my introspective handling of the situation allowed me to recognize that I had lost the love for the sport. This outcome led to my increased focus on intentionality in the things I participate in now.",
            "Question 9": "If I were to create a new project for SEC I\u2019d like to create a seminar called \u201cProfessionalism 101\u201d and incorporate it similarly to how SEC already does industry nights. This seminar would be focused on teaching students how to format a resume, the resume\u2019s content, and highly sought after skills not covered already in courses. I\u2019d like to implement this because I don\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s enough focus on the things needed to excel at internships and career advancement while in school. This feeling comes from my experience along with others\u2019 on how most people found out they should create a resume or how important it is to start building necessary skills early. I found that most often this was spread through word of mouth from parents or peers, which is a fine way to find out about these things, but ultimately can leave some without these resources in the dark. The objective of this project would be to fully inform all engineering students early in their degree the steps they\u2019d need to take to excel in a professional setting. The impact would be that all students are guaranteed the same baseline information on professionalism."

Things such as student oriented career development events and the career fair itself do not happen on its own, and the fact that these are brought to the student body by an organization of our very own aggie engineering students is pretty cool. Recently, I have strived to express similar values of leadership and commitment by being a peer mentor for aspiring freshman engineers through TAMU Engineering Mentorship Council. As a sophomore who still has the freshman experience fresh in mind, I strive to to my best in providing a group of freshmen with the knowledge and resources in various aspects to make informed and successful decisions in college life.",
            "Question 8": "In a introductory courses one takes in Aerospace engineering Introduction to Aerothermodynamics. In this class, we were assigned a group project, where the task at hand was to use the skills we learned in class to analyze a PW F-100 turbojet and calculate the thrust that would be produced in specific atmospheric conditions and report our findings in a paper. This being thermodynamics, there were many ways to analyze thermodynamic processes, some easier than others, some more accurate than others. Essentially, our group were essentially split down the middle between a much easier method that sacrificed work for multiple degrees of error bounds, and a mildly more complicated method that yielded more accurate results. I was the last person to make up their mind and decide the vote, and I chose the latter method in order to achieve better results. Knowing full well that I was essentially deciding more work for the group, I reasoned with them and we split up the workload fairly. Although this was a tough decision that resulted in more work, it paid of vastly and our findings were within +- 1 KN of real world values.",
            "Question 9": "If I had the chance to create a new initiative in the SEC, I would set up a program that allows for students to not only learn about on campus research opportunities in various departments, but also showcase them through in lab tours. Although on campus organizations that promote research are a thing, I don't think engineering research is promoted well enough as a secondary option to the fabled subject of internships. With some coordination with professors doing research across all engineering departments, I would set up a program that provides \"field trips\" of sorts into cool laboratories across campus with some sort of rsvp program that any engineering student could sign up for. Having trips into labs as a coordinated SEC group would not only help get engineering labs more attention, but also serve to inspire engineering students to expand their undergraduate and graduate goals."

Especially for engineers, design projects and community interaction with engineering firms and companies, such as through the career fair, can foster lifelong skills and bonds that will help out in the future. I believe I demonstrated this recently by joining the TAMU branch of the organization SEDS (Students for the Exploration and Development in Space) and applying to be a part of two of their design teams.

            "Question 8": "In my robotics class, when I was a senior in high school, we built robots that were designed to lift cones and place them on poles of various heights. My team designed a robot, but it kept failing, and with a couple of classes left before we had to enter it in a challenge for our grade, we had to make the choice to either try and fix it, or completely scrap the robot and start over. With the deadline looming, my teammates wanted to just try and make it work, but I knew we weren't going to get anywhere in the next few days that would make our robot competition ready, so I had us scrap it, after gently coaxing my team by reminding them that if we started again and didn't finish, we wouldn't really get any worse grade than what we would've if we kept going with the original design. Our team ended up scoring the most points and getting the highest grade in the class.",

Its objectives would be to promote professional advancement by giving potentially hands on learning about what the engineering students who attend are passionate about, where it actually happens. Potential impacts of this project would be networking within a student's chosen career field because they would be learning from the top names in their industries, and building lifelong skills and connections to help them professionally."

I chose to come to America and challenge myself. Even at a young age, I knew America was a country of opportunities; coming to America would open a whole different landscape for my future, although going to high school in Nigeria would have ensured comfort and familiarity. At first, I felt like going back to Nigeria because I couldn't make friends, but after some time and perseverance, it started to become easier to fit in, and things started to look in place.

An example of this is in my robotics club, TURTLE. There have been times where projecting your voice and providing feedback is important to both the project and mentors assisting me. Having a voice as a leader is important to create change and it's a fundamental value I follow.",
            "Question 8": "The time I had to make a difficult decision was when making a modification to a robot model that we were creating during our design process of the project. We had been going back and forth with my group about whether or not the robot should have wheels or legs as a form of movement. Deciding which one was more effective created conflict, so I finally suggested testing both forms of movement. The stalemate in our decision- making was cutting into our time, so my suggestion was used as an aid to make progress rather than being stuck on a design for most of our project. My other team members disagreed with this idea as they thought we would waste time creating the parts rather than sticking to one. However, I decided to share my perspective and argued that if we tested both we could analyze the pros and cons of both movements. This in turn, would help improve our goal rather than choosing one at random. As a result, this choice allowed us to voice issues with our robot early on rather than struggling further down the road, since the movement was a key component.",
            "Question 9": "If I were to create a new project for SEC, I would create a green project which would promote sustainability. I would choose this project because I believe that sustainability is the future, so having students create or design a resource or tool that could help Texas A&M promote sustainability is important. The objective would be for students to brainstorm and model ideas that could be alternatives to items that we use today. Although it may seem complex for freshmen with little experience, making this project purely design and explanation driven will increase inclusivity. This is true since students will not have to create anything physically, but more importantly design it and have a passion for what they designed. This passion will drive success and incentivize a creative outlook for many groups. The potential impact of this project is allowing engineers to get their feet wet in other fields of interest, while expanding on their skills that they have obtained in classes. If they're just starting out then they can expand on what they are passionate about and their ideas, rather than applying skills they have yet to learn."

I loved breaking down complex skills, watching that moment when things finally clicked, and knowing I was making a real impact. It wasn\u2019t just about passing on knowledge\u2014it was about helping others grow and gain confidence. That\u2019s the kind of impact I want to have at A&M.

When I brought it up, not everyone agreed that it was a big issue. We were on a tight deadline, and some teammates felt we should push forward rather than risk delays.\nI understood their concerns, but I also knew that building a model on bad data wouldn\u2019t help anyone. Instead of pushing my opinion, I ran a quick test comparing predictions with and without the flawed data. The results spoke for themselves\u2014the model\u2019s accuracy dropped significantly with the bad data. That convinced the team, and we took a step back to clean and refine the dataset.\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but it paid off. Our final model was far more reliable, and we were proud of the work we produced. That experience taught me that sometimes, making the right call means challenging the status quo\u2014even when it\u2019s uncomfortable.",
            "Question 9": "ChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nOne initiative that could be really beneficial for SEC is a mentorship pairing program, where incoming engineering students are matched with upperclassmen who can offer guidance on academics, extracurriculars, and college life. As a freshman, I felt a bit lost trying to figure out how to balance classes, clubs, and personal growth. I remember asking upperclassmen for advice and one of the best suggestions I got was to get involved in research. That advice ended up being a game-changer for me, as it allowed me to build my skills and gain experience outside of just coursework.\nThe potential impact of this initiative would be huge. New students would have a support system right from the start, helping them feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Having someone to guide you through the tough decisions in your first year can make all the difference. For upperclassmen, it\u2019s an opportunity to develop leadership skills and give back to the community, all while fostering a stronger, more connected engineering network. This kind of mentorship could really make students feel like they have a place to turn when things get tough."

            "Question 7": "In the SEC mission statement it says, \u201cto increase engineering awareness through its programs and events.\u201d This part of the mission statement resonated with me because while engineering is a large major, especially at Texas A&M University, students entering the college of engineering would be more confident if more information was given regarding course rigor, career opportunities, and the resources available for students. I enjoy advocating for programs I am passionate about and gaining involvement. I have applied this in various aspects of my life however the most notable being my time in 4-H. 4-H is a youth development organization for 3rd-12th grade students that focuses on building leadership, selfless service, and relationships. As a Texas 4-H Council Officer I advocated for all Texas members and spoke to National 4-H board members. If given the opportunity I would put those same skills to work as a member of the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "Commitment has always been one of my most important values. Every organization, practice, meeting, or gathering I sign up for, I make it a priority to be present. However, sometimes outside peer pressure tries to pull me away from my commitments. For many summers I participated in 4-H activities for weeks at a time. These included workshops I attended, camps I coordinated, or competitions I qualified for. Last June, my friends planned a beach trip the week I was scheduled to plan/lead a kids cooking camp (Kids in the Kitchen). It was hard to say no to a senior trip that my friends had been looking forward to, but I knew the importance of Kids in the Kitchen and the joy it brings the participants. My friends were not happy with me for quite some time, but we were able to reconnect later in the summer. Despite what others thought of my decision I knew I had to stick to my commitment and not let down the little kids who were counting on me. I know I made the right decision every time a kid shows me how they have applied the skills I taught them.",
            "Question 9": "One of the most beneficial things that the Student Engineering Council does for Texas A&M engineering students professionally is hosting the career fair. I attended my first career fair this spring to practice networking and gain information about the companies represented. However, upon arrival at some of the booths I realized the long lines and did not want to take time away from those actively seeking a job. To resolve these long lines and help students narrow down companies, I propose a day prior to the career fair where companies can sign up to be showcased in front of many students. This would decrease the amount of time recruiters talk to students about their company as a whole, leaving more time to discuss the job/internship, and let recruiters learn more about the student. This would be beneficial to all students no matter if you are just exploring the job market or actively looking for a company that aligns with your values/skills."

            "Question 7": "Of the three pillars, Engineering Awareness resonates with me the most. This is more about about the gathering of passionate individuals who are motivated to a common goal, the collaboration of diverse backgrounds, and a birthplace for new ideas. I think engineering thrives the best with a team, especially with outreach. Being a part of the Science Honor Society, we hosted several events that fostered engineering awareness. One of these events was hosted in collaboration with the Girl Scouts of America, for new potential scouts. We had a booth in which we aided little girls with the teaching, designing, and creating bird feeders using repurposed plastic and material. Within this event, I embodied 3 different outlets for service: the community, my peers, and the kids.",
            "Question 8": "When participating in the harware hackathon, the dealine for the project was coming up close and we were not finished with all the parts for our original design. I suggested that we dropped the external features of our product in order to get the project done on time. I was met with some resistance from some teamates as they wanted to include the part into the final iteration. To handle this situation, I delegated with all the team member to offer input on the suggestion, weighing the potential benefits and risks of proceding with the updated design. After looking at the whole project, the team decided it was best to move forward focusing on the core feature of the project. We were able to make the deadline and submit the project.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create something new for SEC it would involve some type of appreciation activity for teachers, with their students. I know that SEC has an staff initiative for underappreciated staff but I would like to extend that to our teachers. I feel like there might be some lack of connection between the all students and faculty, and not the majority of students have the initiative to go and introduce themselves to teachers and have a conversation with them. It is quite known that those students that have some type of familiarity with their teachers, learn their course material better and become more engaged within classtime. I am sure that if organiations, like the SEC, give student and teachers opportunities to engage, this will benefit both the teacher, in providing better instruction for students, and in turn for the students, who who perform better in class."

            "Question 7": "Although my first year has been filled with new challenges, the SEC has been a pillar of support that provided me with resources to make it easier. From confidence-building workshops before the career fair to passing out 8 a.m. donuts that fueled my motivation to study, the SEC\u2019s dedication to helping students resonates with my desire to give back.\nBefore college, I was fortunate to attend Bank of America\u2019s financial literacy program. After learning about different accounts, budgeting, and credit, I wanted to find a way to give my peers the same learning experience, so I contacted the program and asked them to give a presentation in my neighborhood. After communicating with my HOA and BoFA coordinators, I was able to help 40+ young adults improve their financial literacy as they move into a new phase of their lives. With SEC, I hope to give back through similar experiences.",
            "Question 8": "Nobody in my team had the experience to build the facial recognition software we needed for our smart dorm security system for TamuHack\u2019s hardware challenge, but we were all determined to learn. After building the hardware components, our team was split on whether we should learn to train a facial recognition model or find a powerful Python library that we could implement into our sensors since we were short on time. I recommended that one person train a model, another use the library, and implement the program that was finished first to increase our chances of building a working project. After a few hours, the software built on the powerful library worked sooner, so we integrated that with the hardware. Although we didn\u2019t end up training a model, learning the process helped us gain experience that we can build on in future projects. Additionally, as a result of using the library, our security system actually worked more consistently and impressed the judges with its accuracy. By exploring all the options available and not shutting any idea down, I was able to help our team submit a working project that we were proud of.",
            "Question 9": "With the effects of climate change becoming increasingly prevalent, I believe that the SEC could contribute to fighting this battle at Texas A&M by developing a committee or team that creates \u201cgreen\u201d/sustainable projects and implements them on campus. Although the SEC doesn\u2019t usually build projects, this committee would allow members to gain technical experience, teamwork, and project management skills while still carrying out the SEC\u2019s mission of supporting the engineering community on campus. Essentially, their objective would be to listen to student needs and try to build sustainable solutions. For example, this committee could make projects like solar-powered phone/e-bike/scooter charging stations, or rainwater harvesting systems to use for campus landscaping. These projects aim to introduce green energy solutions to everyday problems, make student life a little easier, and contribute to Texas A&M\u2019s sustainability efforts. Even if it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to build projects, this committee could work with companies or departments in the university to implement solutions that would still help students. If successful, this initiative would expose future students to sustainability efforts, encouraging a culture of environmental awareness and responsibility."

            "Question 7": "The part of SEC's mission that resonates most with me is its commitment to increasing engineering awareness. As someone who changed their major from chemistry to chemical engineering, I initially lacked exposure to the engineering career pathways and opportunities because all of the professional events were exclusively for engineering students except for DI Saturday. This made it difficult to explore my options before I committed to my major.\nI have shown and demonstrated my appreciation to engineering awareness by asking for better accessibility to resources from faculty members. I strive to help others overcome the challenges I faced in the past therefore expanding engineering awareness ensures that all students-regardless of their initial major-can pursue a path and the degree that will best align with their career goals.",
            "Question 8": "During my time as an executive member of my men\u2019s organization, I had to make a tough decision about our recruitment process. In the past, new members were chosen based on the connections they made with executive members during rush. This approach really allowed us to build strong relationships early on with new members, but I felt we needed a revamped system that considered more than the interactions during rush week.\nI brought up that we should incorporate past leadership, involvement, and how well someone\u2019s values aligned with our organization into rush and not just the personal aspect.\nNot everyone on the exec board agreed, saying; \"it felt this would take away the personal aspect of the process.\"\nWe finally found a compromise by keeping the connections at the core of recruitment but we also added more input from general members and valuing candidates\u2019 past experiences more.\nWhile this change is still fairly new, I strongly believe that this will lead to a stronger brotherhood in the organization.",
            "Question 9": "As a Chemical engineering student that initially majored in Chemistry, I was unaware of opportunities like DI Saturday. Even though I was aware of events like industry night and ChemE sophomore retreat, due to their exclusivity to engineering majors, I could not attend. This limited the exposure to the different engineering disciplines and career paths until I had already switched my major. Without access to these events early on, students in similar situations often lack the recourses to explore their options before making a commitment.\nIf I were to introduce a new initiative for the SEC, it would focus on expanding access to career exploration resources for students outside of engineering or those considering transitioning to an engineering degree. By the time someone commits to an engineering degree it is often times too late to make another change, being locked in by their degree hours.\nBy expanding promotion of existing events like DI Saturday or finding an alternative for Industry nights focused for those not in an engineering degree, we can make sure that students have the information they need before committing to a major."

This is the mission that I resonate with. Thus far, I have had very good mentors who have shown me the way forward, and I believe it is my turn to pay it forward. Engineering is a competitive degree path and it is our job as aggies to lift one another up to reach a higher standard for us all. During my time serving in the Marine Corps, it was my responsibility to hold my peers accountable and inspire others to excel forward.",
            "Question 8": "When I was overseas, I had to make a decision that made my platoon (24 members) go on a longer patrol route. The risk of the discussion was a choice between hypothermia, personal morals, and the exposed risk. We had been briefed about a known threat and multiple issues with intelligence. However, the inclement weather had to be considered for the present circumstances. So, during this time, I decided to change the current route to one that was longer, I also took mitigation steps by briefing my team leaders and creating a moral boost while continuing the route. Being innovative and using the medic's knowledge on the patrol allowed us to continue to push through the problematic movement. However, I was not the most popular person when we arrived back at base. We were alive, with no injuries, and completed our mission.",
            "Question 9": "Engineer impact workshops. During this workshop, students and high-impact engineer partners (professors, R&D, alumni, business recruiters), work together for 1 day. The idea is to facilitate small groups of no more than 12 to comb through each person and verify that they are on the right path and have the correct idea of achieving their goals. This would combine methods within the career center to create SMART goals and business professionals' insights on using them in the industry. They could also lay out a good game plan for enhancing their resumes with projects or achievable certificates while in school.\nThe idea is that everyone needs a tailored path to create the best route for them. The school is so large, and advisors have too many people on their plates. This would facilitate personal growth and actionable steps toward getting higher-paying jobs and fulfillment. Rather than using TAMU to get into a good job, I would rather have people move to their dream job and feel fulfilled every night."

I am a huge fan of the SEC's \"aggressive\" approach to getting as many engineering students as possible to attend career chats, career fairs, etc.\nIn my life, I would say I have demonstrated similar values by encouraging as many of my peers as possible to be involved on campus. Back in high school, I wasn't really into any sort of extracurriculars, but during last semester, I proactively tried to apply and network with people in my desired engineering field of study. I found that actually being involved made me much more informed about a variety of engineering aspects. This is why I projected this on my peers, and this semester, they are also proactively applying to on-campus organizations and jobs!",
            "Question 8": "One time I had to make a difficult decision was during one of my extracurriculars. I was part of a team responsible for researching sponsorship opportunities. My role was to apply to these sponsorship opportunities, while my teammate handled the actual research. I noticed concerns regarding his time management and the quality of his work, so I addressed the issue privately during a 1-on-1 meeting. During the discussion, he became defensive, expressing that he felt my expectations were too high and asking for more flexibility. I listened to his concerns, but I emphasized that in order to achieve positive outcomes, we needed to improve the quality and consistency of our research. After a week or so, he did not improve/take any of my advice, so I decided to report him to the manager of the organization. The problem was that the manager of the organization was best friends with the person I was working with, which led to conflict. My director was extremely reluctant when I brought the topic up, but eventually, after enough persuasion, my teammate was removed from the organization, and a new member was hired. This new member was much more diligent and disciplined with his work.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative/project for the SEC, I would make a series of informational meetings and workshops that can help engineering students find internships, improve their LinkedIn and resumes, network properly, etc.\nI do acknowledge that the SEC has a lot of projects revolving around getting companies to do talks at A&M, but not so much workshops specifically related to resume and career-building/personal growth workshops (or maybe I haven't heard of them as much as the other events/projects/initiatives that the SEC puts out).\nNonetheless, I do feel like this would have an extremely positive impact because the majority of engineering students struggle with their personal branding skills (ex: resume building, networking properly, etc.) By implementing a series of these workshops, this would significantly aid engineering students in separating themselves from the main crowd and really standing out as unique from other applicants for internships or jobs."

Once we leave Texas A&M we will enter into a new era of livelihood and it is important that the organizations around us help us prepare for the new chapter to come. To advance my personal professionalism, I recently updated and improved both my resume and my LinkedIn profile. Similarly, I began researching and applying to companies that are attending this semester's career fair in hopes of securing an internship for the upcoming summer. I will be going to the in-person career fair and making an effort to network with the companies there in hopes of progressing my engineering expertise.",
            "Question 8": "Once while I was leading my fellow bass drummers as a section leader. I was instructed by my director to practice a section of music and if I deemed it was not ready to be played in competition I had his permission to cut the music. We practiced for hours, but no matter how I explained it or how close we got it was never clean enough to use at competition. I then explained that I would report back to the director and the music would be cut to my team. They were extremely upset that we had spent so much time on music we would not even be using and they felt we could play. I had to explain that, while we could use the music, it would only result in us dragging down the score of the whole band. While my decision was still not supported, I nonetheless executed my decision. In the week to come we would continue to practice the music to incorporate it into future competitions, and by around halfway through the season we were able to use the music and increase the score of our show.",
            "Question 9": "I would push for monthly sustainability challenges. For example, we could organize challenges where students design and implement small-scale sustainability projects, like creating a rainwater harvesting system or solar-powered device. I love this idea as I grew up helping my mom make things like rain catchers in the backyard and plant boxes to help grow our own herbs. So, these challenges would allow students to demonstrate creativity in engineering while improving local sustainability efforts. The impact this would have is to encourage the practical application of sustainable engineering principles, raise awareness of environmental issues, and foster a sense of community through creativity."

All was going well until our performance day neared, and minor disagreements escalated. My mom organized our dance positions based on our performance and timing with the beat, causing me to be center stage. Some of my friends weren\u2019t happy about this, feeling that I was getting more exposure. Rather than improving their own performance, they became upset with me, which created tension. Caught between my mom and my friends, I had to reason with my friends, ask them what truly was bothering them, and if there\u2019s anything that can smooth out the issue.

I believe fostering a diverse professional environment is essential to that sense of expression, and I particularly have an interest in creating that in the field of engineering. One time I used this value of mine was in an experimental course my honors program coordinator is teaching. We had an assignment to create a superhero with AI that represented us, and use it to tell our story.

On top of the fact that COVID was heavily pervasive, my ability to participate in dance shows and classes were inhibited. After a while of this struggle, I realized that I had to free up some more time for myself to heal, both mentally and physically. I let myself take the time I needed to critically think about what the best option for me was, and eventually, I decided I needed to take a break from dancing to give myself and my body rest. Though my dance teacher did not agree with my decision, I was better off for it in the long run\u2014I was able to get back on top of my schoolwork, my injuries healed, and I had time for myself mentally. I was able to later come back to dance on my own terms, and now, my relationship with it is stronger than ever.",

Once I arrived in College Station, I faced challenges being far away from my family at any given moment, without the opportunity to drive back home to them. However, I met some amazing people here and discovered opportunities that allowed me to grow as a person. I have become more resilient to hardships, reinforced and restructured my beliefs, and matured as a person. When I look back and reflect on my thoughts from years ago, I am proud of my decision, even if it was not universally supported at first. I would not trade anything for my experience here, and I am glad to be in College Station today.",
            "Question 9": "My proposed initiative for the SEC would be to partner with various engineering departments so that freshman\u2013who meet necessary course prerequisites\u2013 can substitute a general science requirement with an introductory course in their intended major as part of their ETAM requirements. Some departments, such as Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, already offer these opportunities to first-year students, providing an early opportunity to learn core concepts of the degree program. Because this experience is unique to a major-specific class, I believe taking a department specific engineering-focused course instead of a general science would give students a clearer picture of their potential field before they submit their ETAM applications. Furthermore, an additional experience to the ones received in ENGR 102 and ENGR/PHYS 216. Moreover, early exposure to these classes can ignite passion and motivation to ambitious students. A deeper academic interest from a freshman's first year in college would likely lead to a higher retention rate in the College of Engineering and positively increase an engineering student's experience at Texas A&M from the academic prospective."

In high school, I worked as a teacher, tutor, customer service associate, and interned at a tech company, which helped me develop both professionally and socially. These experiences taught me how to communicate effectively\u2014an essential skill for career growth. I want to help others in the same way by guiding them toward career opportunities and showing them that starting without experience is okay, as meaningful growth comes with effort. This aligns with another goal of the mission: being a representative voice.

            "Question 8": "A time I had to make a difficult decision was when I decided to drop from my track team in my senior year as co-captain of the throwing team. I had been involved in track for about four years, but a chronic back injury progressed, making it difficult for me to perform well, attend practices, and actively contribute as a co-captain. Ultimately, I had to end my season early because continuing would have risked causing a permanent injury. It was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, as it meant leaving a team I had been with for such a long time. This experience taught me that sometimes it\u2019s okay to put yourself first, even if it means stepping away from something important, and that making tough decisions for your health and well-being is necessary for long-term growth.",

We would partner with local organizations or non-profits and involve faculty and professionals to mentor the teams in developing solutions. The competition would culminate with the team presenting the winning idea, which would then be implemented in collaboration with the corresponding organization. The potential impact of this initiative is to give first- and second-year students hands-on experience while making a positive impact. It would foster collaboration, leadership, and innovation\u2014skills that are vital in future engineering careers. Additionally, students would have the opportunity to enhance their professional growth by working alongside companies and faculty to create real-world solutions which aligns with one of the SEC mission targets: professional advancement."

Ever since I was young my uncle had always expressed how significant most if not all the engineering fields are for the future. So for me it was easy to see that Engineering is definitely a crucial foundation for innovation and progress in nearly every aspect of our world, from technology and infrastructure to sustainability. To me I feel that every child should have access to that type of engineering passion and wisdom so that their own concept of STEM can flourish. Going to K-12 schools and presenting some of the wonders of engineering can accomplish peaking the younger interest which then will hopefully lead to them considering their own lives as an engineer. Every child deserves to know what being a true engineer entails.",
            "Question 8": "My collaborative leadership skills played an integral role when I volunteered as President of the Young Men's Service League (YMSL), Heritage Chapter Class of 2024 during the COVID-19 pandemic. YMSL is dedicated to serving those in need in our community, developing leadership skills, and promoting mother-son relationships. My job as President was to organize and lead meetings, and develop a sense of purpose among our class. Our YMSL experience unfortunately started on Zoom at the height of social distancing. I had to think creatively about what kinds of activities would encourage participation. Finding topics that appealed to my audience was critical because otherwise, they would turn off their cameras and not participate. Despite pushback from our Grade Level Advisor and stretching the limits of what Nationals deemed acceptable for a meeting, I set out to create captivating Zoom meetings. For example, once, I set up a Socratic seminar about how the Spartans trained their soldiers and how it compared to today's society. It even contained some clips from the film \u2018300\u2019 making it one of my most enthusiastic meetings. With my leadership initiating these neo-meetings, the year became more meaningful and built our foundation to serve our community.",
            "Question 9": "Anyone who has participated in a science fair knows the feeling of excitement and pride as you see all your hard work come together, knowing you\u2019re about to share something amazing with others who appreciate science as much as you do. Now imagine this same feeling and type of event but for the clubs of the College of Engineering. I think that it would be really amazing to see the different kinds of projects and/or inventions that each club could come up with. I oversaw something similar in my high school: a culture day where all of the different culture clubs were able to create something fun for the students to learn about the different cultures. This would be a little different in that it would be friendly competition with judges and a lot more technological. However, the outcome would be relatively the same, it would foster creativity, innovation, and collaboration amongst the engineering community. There could even be certain objectives or prompts that the students could follow for an initiative. The top projects could even lead to a breakthrough; thereby encouraging progress and philanthropy as well as community engagement if the projects were to be incorporated into society."

            "Question 8": "Last year, I was the project lead on the development of a video game inspired by the classic Little Red Riding Hood. It wasn't until the last week of the timeline that we discovered a game-breaking bug that only occurred in a rare set of circumstances. With our deadline fast approaching, we needed to make a decision that split the team: do we push the date so that it could be properly fixed, or hope for the best and assume that no one would encounter the bug?\nAs the leader, the decision was ultimately up to me. To the disappointment of some of my team, I pushed back the deadline, which allowed us to not only fix the bug but also allowed for additional testing in order to further polish our final product. In the SEC, tough decisions will arise whether in planning events or allocating resources, and I want to be the kind of leader who prioritizes long-term impact over short-term ease so that the SEC can continue to provide the the best opportunities and experiences for the engineering community here at A&M.",
            "Question 9": "My very first experience with the career fair was rough: I dressed in business professional attire and only talked to one booth before leaving in total panic. The stress of approaching companies with an empty resume\u2014knowing I had more to offer but no traditional experience to back it up\u2014got me thinking: what if we flipped the script?\nWhat if we created a reverse career fair, where we flip the dynamic and have students set up booths to showcase their projects and skills\u2014kind of like a hackathon, but with more preparation? Students can apply to present something they\u2019re proud of, like research, a personal coding project, or an engineering design, making an impression beyond just a resume.\nThrough this event, we\u2019ll be able to foster a more natural conversation beyond a rushed elevator pitch and allow students to impress companies with their skills, even if they don\u2019t have internships under their belt. This can help students not only gain confidence in their skills but also refine their pitches before talking to a wider pool of industry professionals. More importantly, this event helps shift the focus from what\u2019s missing on their resume to what they can do now, emphasizing creativity, initiative, and hands-on experience."

To act on this purpose, I became a peer mentor for CLEN 181. I wanted to ensure all the incoming freshmen knew they could express themselves and acknowledge when someone felt unheard. I tried my best to facilitate a classroom that focused on creating a community where its peers could depend and rely on each other. When holding one on one\u2019s, I asked questions to gauge on whether or not people felt that they had a voice. By understanding what they are liking and disliking, I was able to make the classroom a better fit for each student. I want to continue to give others the chance to make their voice heard through what I can do.",
            "Question 8": "Choosing something that a majority of people would frown upon is not typically something that I do. I think it is important to find a mutual stance in every situation and be willing to make sacrifices to satisfy all parties but also provide the most beneficial outcome. It is deeply rooted in my nature to look for ways to communicate and come to an agreement. In my freshman year, I took CHEM 120, as part of this class I had to participate in a symposium. There were several minor disagreements such as deciding on a topic and how to divide up the work. What I did was find what each person liked about their own unique topic and find ways that could implement that into another idea presented by someone else and vice versa. After being able to create a common ground for the group, I worked to delegate tasks to ensure every person was happy with the research they would be required to do. As a result, the group as a whole scored a near perfect score. Each member was excited to present their research. Since every person enjoyed what they researched, the presentation flowed and had a uniqueness.",
            "Question 9": "One of the most sought-after things for an undergraduate engineer is obtaining an internship. While a good part of the student body is able to find their own internship, I think providing more aid in this area would be vital for the development of aggie engineers. There are events currently provided that help in this aspect, however, I do think it is necessary for it to have its own event. Inviting companies that want to fill current internship opportunities would be the key in this event. Incorporating more companies for all the engineering majors and minors would be vital in finding something for everyone. An event like this could change the readiness of aggie engineers' post-graduation. With an event targeted to ensure students procure an internship, more students would feel less anxious when starting a job hunt. Not only do I think this would boost mental health by eliminating some stress towards going into the workforce, but internships would also provide an undergraduate (and possibly graduates) with vital experience. Experience can be the key in being offered a job post-graduation. Experience from internships can also help a student decipher what they want to do with their degree."

This conversation mostly flabbergasted me, but I stood by it because not only being stripped of my title but also getting suspended wouldn't look good. My closest friends disagreed with me just sitting by and watching the admin bully a fellow student. 3rd period came around the next day, and I had to decide to support my friend, who did not deserve to be discriminated against. I saw five people get up and walk out of class. The next thing I knew was I was in a hallway with hundreds of other kids saying the same thing, all under one goal.

Coming to Texas A&M to study engineering happened purely by chance, but over the past 2 years, I fell in love with this field that once seemed so impossible and intimidating. My only regret is wishing this world had reached me earlier. Seeing my own struggles reflected in my younger sister, I became passionate about helping others discover their interests. At Texas A&M, I\u2019m organizing a consulting career fair and have spoken at informational and coffee chats, emphasizing inclusivity across all schools so that any student might discover a passion for consulting. This passion also inspired me to center my capstone around engaging K-12 students, giving them early exposure to engineering in the hope that it might spark the same curiosity and excitement the way it did for me.",

However, my social director disagreed, expressing concerns that it might exclude members. She also made the point that our organization already had a sports chair with sporting events. While I understood her perspective, I still believed there was a way to keep up with the growing interest in sporting activities. I proposed a plan to also include casual and low-pressure activities, where participation wasn\u2019t determined by athletic ability. I also added post-game socials, such as group dinners. To further address concerns, I suggested allowing members to switch fams if they felt a different group would better suit their interests. After discussing it, we agreed to give it a try. Compared to previous semesters, we had a much higher member retention. Events had strong turnouts with members, as it created a stronger community for those who could venture into something intimidating at a much more beginner and inclusive level.",
            "Question 9": "I propose a project that has Texas A&M students act as engineering ambassadors to inspire the next generation. The goal is to increase engineering awareness and excitement early on among K-12 students by connecting them with TAMU engineering students who share their own personal journeys, interests, experiences, and projects. Stories and interactions reach younger students on a much deeper level the same way they\u2019re inspired by astronauts and firefighters through the storytelling element. The initiative focuses on having interactive classroom visits, allowing for a casual setting, especially those without access to STEM programs or events. These visits will feature various engineering disciplines sharing their experiences and emphasizing how diverse engineering can be. By talking about hands-on projects, ambassadors can demonstrate that engineering isn\u2019t about math, but about turning ideas into real-world solutions that have an impact on society. To help students feel motivated rather than intimidated, each visit will include an interactive activity tailored to the age group. The short-term goal is to inspire curiosity and excitement to motivate students to explore STEM further, while also forming stronger connections between TAMU engineering students and local schools. This aims to bridge the gap for students who lack exposure to engineering."

I imagine it to be similar to a TED talk of which anyone can attend, including 6-12th grade students. SEC is about being a representative voice and I believe Engineers have a lot to advocate for and many have passions that they would like to speak about when their heads aren't buried in a computer."

We had wanted to room together still, but he also wanted to include two other people that were good people but also shared my roommates approach to their college careers. While he was my childhood best friend, I had to protect what I had. I decided it was best to increase the space between us and I would room with randoms instead. To not sever the friendship, I explained that I still wanted to be friends, but that I didn't think we worked well as roommates.

I would want to lead a project on a communication overhaul between the SEC and students. The more people know about the great events and additions to the engineering experience that the SEC has, the more people will see the good work that is being done beyond the career fair. I would want the project to have two emphases: consistency and timeliness. I would want to have somewhere for all of the SEC events to be consolidated for any student to look at and know what events happening. I would also like for this repository to have details about dress code, location, information, and any other important notes for students.

Even though the chances were incredibly small that something could go wrong, I proposed that we stop what we are doing currently and fix our mistakes to create a safer structure. It set us back a couple of weeks and cost us lots of money.

This would impact many students and parents who are struggling to pay their way through college. It relieves a lot of stress knowing that they don't have to take a loan that can put lots of students in bad financial situations after college."

            "Question 7": "An area of SEC\u2019s mission that resonates with me is increasing engineering awareness through programs and events. The reason why is because I felt distant from engineering as a freshman. I didn't feel like I was studying engineering, rather just attending school in hope engineering was the right decision. I overlooked the resources and depth of the engineering program until I met more people as the semesters went on. Although unaware of SEC at the time, I enjoyed events such as industry night that exposed me to what engineering jobs and lifestyle is like. I also had fun during E-week, especially the free food! Recently, my friend told me about the SEC. I realized how significant it is to have an organization such as the SEC at A&M. Thus, I insist on returning the favor by providing my services in ensuring success and fulfillment in all engineers.",
            "Question 8": "I recall a group project in freshman year consisting of programming a card game. My group consisted of 3 classmates new to Java. I brainstormed with the group in which we formulated rules of the card game, and who will code what. The problem is, I leaned toward an approach that wasn\u2019t easy to split up an even amount of work. Although one guy insisted on splitting the work evenly with another approach, my mindset was to avoid debugging messy code later. The other two girls were okay with either decision. We ended class without deciding.\nThus, with my stubbornness I coded the entire structure of the program myself over the weekend. Once Monday came along, I let the group know I built the main game (mostly logic and user interface). Fortunately, everyone seemed fine with it and were impressed. Before you say, I took up their chance of coding, I left the rules for them to implement with 2 functions per person! Along the way I helped and explained the code if needed. In the end, we presented it during class, even though it had an error somewhere, our TA didn\u2019t get it, and we got a 100!",
            "Question 9": "One project that comes to my mind is a mentorship program. While A&M has multiple mentorship programs, I have not seen one that directly pairs freshmen with upperclassman engineering students. I believe the goal of this mentorship program would be to provide guidance to new engineering students at A&M from those who have been there and done that.\nFor instance, freshman studying engineering need insight on offered organizations, majors and what to look out for regarding coursework. This mentorship would be in depth rather than general advice. My plan would be based on class schedules, personal interests and shared majors of the mentee and mentor. This fosters great relationships that would help boost the mentee\u2019s confidence, improve grades and encourage attending events such as the ones hosted by SEC.\nThe reason why I show passion in this type of project is because I would have loved it in freshman year. I felt like I missed out on opportunities and learning experiences that could have improved my professionalism and cleared any doubts about studying engineering. The overall impact of this project is to provide guidance, knowledge and a fun experience for freshman engineering students."

It has improved human lives in countless ways. With the fast-paced technological advances and innovations, the world today needs more engineers than ever to face the challenges and grasp the opportunities. TAMU is one of the best engineering schools in the nation and the world. I think we have an obligation to expand engineering awareness to attract more talents into the profession. I have always been interested in engineering since I was very young. When it\u2019s time to apply for colleges, engineering is my first choice of all majors. I\u2019m honored and proud to be a student at the TAMU Engineering School and I\u2019m excited about the SEC\u2019s mission to expand engineering awareness to let other students know about the exciting opportunities this profession will offer.",
            "Question 8": "In my senior year, my high school orchestra planned a Disney trip to Orlando, Florida in the spring semester. This was a trip that I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a long time. But when the spring semester started, I spent too much time playing video games and my grades slipped. My parents started to suggest that I pull out of the trip. The situation got so bad that they were about to email my director that I will not be going. Instead of giving up, I made a promise to my parents that I\u2019ll make sure to catch up on my grades. During the weeks leading up to the trip, I made sure I managed my time well every day and studied extra hard to do well in all my classes. My grades eventually caught up and I was able to make the trip of my life with all my friends.",
            "Question 9": "I would like to create a new outreach and mentorship program called \"Engineer to Innovator\". Many high school students do not know which major to choose when they apply for colleges, and a lot of freshmen in the engineering school are also unsure about which major to choose in ETAM. From my personal experience at TAMU, I learned tremendously from my fellow upperclassmen. The objective of this initiative is to inspire and guide students by creating a mentorship network that connects upperclassmen engineering students with college freshmen and high school students. This program will foster personal and academic growth, expose students to the diverse fields of engineering and inspire them to pursue STEM careers. It will also strengthen the connection between TAMU\u2019s engineering school and the local community."

            "Question 7": "I have always been an advocate for the advancement of engineering in all aspects. When I was young, I fell in love with space after a trip to the country side one afternoon and looking up at the stars. I came back to school the following week and learned all that I possibly could about it. This of course leads to the inevitable discovery of NASA. Through that, I have met with sevral NASA engineers myself, become a NASA Texas Junior Scholar, and have learned plenty about the realm of engineering. Through all of this learning, I have come to understand how important engineering is in all of lives and how it can affect us in so many indirect ways that positively contribute to the lives of others. I share this fact with everyone I know and everyone I can. I love being passionate about engineering.",
            "Question 8": "One of lifes greatest issues is having a finite amount of time to get things accomplished. This is sometimes something that you learn the hard way, and this was the case for me. In high school, I was apart of my schools engineering club, and I eventually got to the point where I was one of the leading members of the club through senority and experience. I was primarily in charge of 3D printing and design, and I was tasked with teaching newer members how to go through design processes. Through this, there was school competitions. I also happened to be a competitive Irish dancer, and here is where the problem evolves. One competition happened to fall on the same weekend, both pivitol team competitions. Unfortunately this meant making a choice, and I chose Irish dancing. I have had longer ties with Irish dance, it was a higher stakes competition, and there was more time invested. It of course made my engineering teammates sad, and a little worried given I had more experience, but I made sure that I gave ample time to prepare them, reensure them, and teach them to my best abilities. I gave my best to both.",
            "Question 9": "I would want to create an initiative that focused on helping engineering students fund their own research and test projects. I do believe that learning a lot about the fundamentals that make engineering work is important; however, I believe going hands on, testing, and working through ideas is one of the best ways to advance students undesrstanding of engineering processes and to advance the field of engineering in general. One of the greatest things that I have taken from my time as a NASA Texas Junior Scholar is understanding that a lot of NASA research, regardless of weather or not it succeeds within NASA itself, is repurposed within the engineering space and utilized in civilian projects that better communities; a prime example of simply working through problems creating better things. It would focus on ensuring students have an outlined process, an understanding of cost of their project, and ensuring that they can properly test their idea. This would all be done primarily through willing sponers, fund raisers, or donations. Teamwork would be heavily encouraged, and I think it would be a great way to connect and unify engineering groups to a common goal outside of independent student organizations."

            "Question 7": "Growing up as the \u201cquiet kid\u201d highlighted my frustration in feeling unheard and unseen and thus fueled my motivation to prevent this for others around me, whether it was simply saying \u201cI\u2019m listening\u201d in a group setting where someone was being disregarded or running to the back of the crowd while passing out flags during a parade. This, coupled with being the youngest child, makes the \u201crepresentative voice\u201d aspect of the SEC stand out to me. In my engineering courses, it is common that the girls will congregate in one corner of the male-dominated classroom, afraid to ask questions and voice their thoughts during labs, and I counter this by speaking up within and beyond the classroom. Aside from this, bench pressing at Polo empowers me, as well as offering other girls a spot. I aim to illustrate that merely presence is representative too in all that I do.",
            "Question 8": "\u201cLet\u2019s hang out when you guys are back in town!\u201d \u201cBet, where do y\u2019all wanna eat?\u201d Silence fills the group chat following this dreaded question that always seems to cycle. Even searching my iMessages now, this conversation has mutated to countless variations over the past years. Surely this choice would come naturally for a group chat called \u201cbig backtivities,\u201d right? Wrong. Being from Houston, a place with its endless dining options, does not make this process any easier. One instance I recall specifically was this past winter break, a prolonged period when one friend and I were both back in our hometown, also where our two other friends stayed for university. We frequented In-N-Out previously, as featured in our Google Photos album, but Friend 1 thought it was time for a change, suggesting a pepperoni pizza place in Midtown. \u201cThey can\u2019t eat pork, goofy,\u201d I reminded. \u201cNot much they can eat there, let\u2019s choose somewhere else.\u201d After thorough deliberation considering dining choices, prices, and driving distance, we were able to narrow it down. \u201cHow about ramen in Bellaire?\u201d \u201cSounds good!\u201d Though seemingly trivial, this situation showcases the significance of reviewing decision factors, as well as gathering input from involved parties.",
            "Question 9": "The SEC is filled with driven, motivated individuals that largely impact other students in the College of Engineering, both inside and outside the classroom. With such a large engineering program, it can be difficult to find an academic or professional mentor to help navigate through the chaoticity and unfamiliarities that college, especially engineering, holds. To combat this, I believe the implementation of a mentorship program would be quite beneficial and even assist freshmen in selecting their majors in the ETAM process and internship opportunities as well. Specifically, an SEC member would be matched with an underclassman for that given semester/year to supplement them with TAMU specific and distinct industry guidance, and participation as a mentor could also be a method to fulfill the point requirements each semester. Not only would this program assist in the transition for the incoming freshmen, as well as ensure long-lasting success socially and academically as new engineering Aggies, this would also allow the SEC a much longer period to fully assess potential future SEC applicants. Along with this, this newfound team could also host ETAM workshops to offer application advice, even to those not involved in the mentee program directly."

The reason why I resonate with this part of the mission is that I already made an effort to spread the importance of networking and connections, attending career fairs, and applying for internships. Even though I am not obligated to do so, I try to make it evident to my peers on a near daily basis to attend these events because 1) it gives you experience of what a career fair is like. 2) even if you do not get an internship, you still put that effort in that someone else may have been too nervous to. There is value in the effort you put into your future, and I find more and more people today who take it for granted. I want to change that.",
            "Question 8": "A time when I had to make a difficult decision that not everyone agreed with was when I decided to transfer to TAMU in the Spring and not in the Fall. The reason why I felt the need to transfer in the Spring is because that was when my GPA would be at its highest and most competitive for the engineering program. My parents suggested transferring in the Fall to save more money and acquire more credits, but I had to convince them otherwise. I handled the situation by having a long discussion with my parents about how I would be living in town, paying for school, traveling, and also the inconveniences that transferring with all the credits can cause. Based on my knowledge of others' situations, having all your credits done and then transferring can cause you to minor in something to fill in empty credits for your first semester. I did not want to be in that boat as that would cause me to have many hours and also a heavier workload than I already would have. After further discussion, my parents understood my position and let me go through with the plan.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new initiative or project for SEC, I would suggest at least 1 more career fair for engineering towards the end of the semester or perhaps in the summer. It would have the exact same purpose and objectives that are set for the fairs in the spring in fall. I simply noticed that the majority of engineering fairs happen in the Fall, so I would like to have more options in the spring/summer sessions. This may sound unrealistic or extremely costly, but that is how I feel. I would like as many opportunities as possible for all engineering students to get their name out there and start their careers."

I believe that as an engineering student, you need to be involved in or at least aware of different beneficial events and opportunities, and that is what I like most about the SEC. The impact of SEC is important because it connects engineering students with opportunities that would benefit them in their professional careers and future.

            "Question 8": "One time when I had to make a difficult decision was when I had to choose which major to ETAM into once I had to fill out the preference list. In my mind at the time, I was torn between aerospace and petroleum engineering, as I have always wanted to do aerospace, however, I found myself pulled towards petroleum engineering whenever I went to DI Saturdays and things like that. I had always thought that I just wanted to do aerospace, even going into college, but now I felt lost. I didn't want to make the wrong choice because I felt as if my entire future was going to ride on this decision. To help me decide, I talked with loved ones such as family and close friends, because I know that they have my best interest in their hearts. After listening to the people around me, I decided to stick with aerospace because the people that I talked to made me realize that I should go after what I enjoy, and never give up no matter how hard the future may be. This taught me the importance of collaboration with people, and I am now happy with my choice.",
            "Question 9": "Personally, I think what the SEC is doing already is amazing, and as far as a new idea, I would think that it would be more expansive upon what it is already doing well. My favorite part of SEC is the fact that it connects students to many beneficial opportunities, and if I were to create a new project/initiative based on that, I would think something like that would expand upon already great opportunities is a good start. For example, in the career fair, there may be employers/companies that cannot make it, so maybe creating more opportunities for companies to come out to TAMU periodically throughout the semester would be great. So for example, let's say a company is incapable of making it to the career fair, and rather than just waiting for next semester's career fair, what if they were invited to TAMU on another day so that any students who wish to talk to them still have the ability to. Like a mini career fair where there are just one or two companies at a time periodically throughout the semester based on different companies' availability. This way, companies can always recruit, and students can always get hired."

I left my comfort zone only to figure out that you must keep doing so until you become comfortable being uncomfortable. While that frightened one side of me, it helped me discover my life-long passion: optimization. I practice this passion in every scenario possible. From improving systems in my business to increase profits to finding the absolute swiftest way around campus, I have been looking for other outlets I can pour this passion into\u2014and there is no other place like SEC where I can use optimization and development to better the opportunities for thousands of other engineers. The SEC is almost a century old, but that does not mean it is perfect. I would love to join SEC and further its development to help make TAMU engineers that much better.",
            "Question 8": "If I were tasked with bringing forth the newest initiative for SEC, it would have to be a series of workplace workshops. Intelligent ran a poll of 1000 businesses and found that 75% of businesses had issues with hiring recent college graduates. I feel that many students, while they are prepared educationally to use the skills they\u2019ve learned, lack the actual workplace knowledge to be outstanding employees in the workforce. Potential workshop topics could include introducing general workplace expectations, maximizing efficiency during a workday, explaining deliverables and timelines, what working in a group setting is like, and tools to help you build up skills you don\u2019t possess. I would like the initiative to aim at helping students have awareness about these things so that when they enter the workforce, they can hit the ground running instead of being like other students who are thrown into a job and have to learn workplace culture on their own. The potential for this initiative could have companies see engineers from A&M as more valuable since less time and resources would be exhausted on trying to teach them and make our engineers more confident and competent, putting them ahead of other new hires.",
            "Question 9": "Returning to school after COVID was an adjustment. Not only was I now in high school, but I also had to go back to my disability services classes designed to prepare me for the real world. During my annual ARD meeting, my teachers, counselors, parents, and I would establish my needs and goals for the year. At this time, I was starting to see the benefits of self-improvement, and I was curious about how far I could expand my horizons. So I proposed the idea of \u2018graduating\u2019 from services. They suggested it was best to continue with services as it had no downside, but the relentless fire in me wanted to prove that my disability does not define me and that if I wanted to, I could do what everyone else could. Looking back, while I am grateful for what I learned from those classes, it was an inhibitor and put a limiting mindset upon me, preventing me from becoming the man I have become. I am proud that I dared to go out of my comfort zone and it allowed me to learn from real experiences, not exercises, on how to live and thrive in the real world."

            "Question 7": "The part of the SEC that resonates with me the most is its goal of developing Texas A&M's reputation and improving the professional advancement of the students who attend here. I came to Texas A&M because all I ever heard about it was how amazing its engineering school is. I believe this is due to the work the SEC does in the background by bringing companies and career fairs to this school. In a similar way being a member of the Aggie Club of Engineers means that it is my duty as a member to improve the reputation of the organization on campus. By doing this I have to act in a certain way that won't bring embarrassment whenever in public and must embody the values of the organization.",
            "Question 8": "After graduating high school, I wanted to take a gap semester before going to university. Many of my friends disagreed with my decision because they thought that taking a gap would turn into never coming back to education. What made the decision so difficult was that it felt like my friends were getting ahead of me while I just fooled around. I decided that I would take the gap semester and go to Germany to study German. The outcome was that when I finished my gap I turned into a completely different person and was able to manage university better than the people who came directly here. Many people told me that taking the gap semester would only bring negatives however it only brought positives. Whether you call it confidence or egoism I ignored the advice of those close to me because I knew that this was the correct decision for me.",
            "Question 9": "A good project that the SEC could do is bring engineering to the local grade schools. The SEC already does the EnVision conference which is targeted to high school students who are interested in STEM. However, I believe it to be more beneficial to bring STEM to a younger audience. A way this can be done is by doing cool engineering projects and bringing them to the local schools. If you can inspire the younger kids there will be a more likely chance that when they grow up they still will be interested in STEM."

Throughout my whole life, I\u2019ve always wanted to be a leader. If I can't help myself, I should at least help others. SEC\u2019s development pathway in terms of advancing the professional lives of Engineers called out to me as I truly want to make a difference in fellow Engineers\u2019 lives. One way I\u2019ve demonstrated a similar value in my life is when I was part of Global Impact Initiative, a non-profit refugee professional development organization. Although it wasn\u2019t engineering focused, I was a lead tutor for multiple Afghanistan refugees, helping them learn English and math. Being part of this organization for months helped me realize that there was more of a leadership aspect to me, and I want to utilize that by being a part of SEC.",
            "Question 8": "When I realized that I didn\u2019t get into TAMU as a main campus student, the thought of coming here startled me. I would sit in my room and ponder on whether UTD Computer Science was a better option than being a TEAB student without having the guarantee of my major. The look on my parents\u2019 faces would always tell me the same thing. Dallas was the choice. But there was something holding me back. It was as if I was all alone with a small spark towards A&M, while everyone advised me to pick UTD. It was mid February and I headed to my local temple for my weekly prayer. As I was sitting in the ashram section in the temple and meditated for a few minutes, I realized that A&M was where I belonged despite the fact that I wouldn\u2019t have my major and would be part of TEAB. It was as if TAMU was calling for me. Now that I look back at my decision, I can\u2019t feel more proud of the decision I took. As a proud Aggie, I\u2019m happy to be part of the Engineering community in Texas A&M University.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an application called CareerInfo. This application would be for career fair students. A lot of students are truly underprepared for the career fair. I\u2019ve heard stories of recruiters absolutely crushing students when they stand in line without knowing what the company is about. As students prepare their resumes and elevator pitches in line, there is a lot of tension involved. CareerInfo would be an application where all the companies that are attending the career fair for that certain semester/year would be shown on the app. Students would be able to select what companies they want to talk to, and there would also be company research pre-provided for students. Along with this, students will be able to see on the app what majors the company hires, what row they are in the event center, and whether they are coming for both the days or just one. The objective of this application is for students to be more prepared for career fairs so they can reach their goals. The impact I hope to achieve through this project is for a higher variety of companies to attend the career fair and for students to be successful in it."

            "Question 7": "What resonates with me most with SEC's mission is their goal to foster professional advancement. Throughout my high school career I participated in a volunteering organization named, STEM Bus. In STEM Bus, me and fellow volunteers would go around and teach kids of all ages and backgrounds different things about STEM. The reasoning was to foster both and interest in the STEM field and to educate the kids and teach them something new. The problem is that doing such things sadly costs money. To solve this issue me and my fellow volunteers went to many different companies, like Dell, and talked with both those in charge and everyday employees. With much work and effort, and hosting a small event at Dell, we were able to secure funding from them.",
            "Question 8": "One time I had to make a difficult decision, that not everyone agreed with during the Technology Student Association's State competition. that I participated in with a group of my friends. On the day we were tasked with presenting our project to a panel of judges, tragedy struck. Somehow, the project managed to break overnight, despite being secured safely in a group member's room. That morning we had to both fix the project and present it. My group was split between doing a rebuild or fast repair. Having the final say, I decided that we should engage in the fast repair so we can make it to our time slot. Despite many protests, we quickly put our project back together to the best of our ability and made it to the time slot with 5 minutes left. Once the competition was over, we had made it to 3rd place. If we had gone with the rebuild, we would've not had ti done by the time out timeslot came around, causing us to not place high.",
            "Question 9": "If I could create a new project for SEC, it would be a funding event to secure more funding. The reasoning behind this, is that with more funding comes the capability to make a greater impact in the engineering community. It would allow SEC to host more and larger events, as well as the ability to have a greater outreach."

            "Question 7": "I have long been a firm believer that the role of college is not simply to educate students in their desired fields. As vice president of my high school FRC robotics team, I talked to many industry professionals, and everybody said the same thing. The engineers they hire have all the necessary technical knowledge and willingness to learn, but they cannot handle themselves well professionally. Recently, even my Engineering 216 professor made the same point. To truly help our engineers make a big impact, we need to develop their social and professional skills. From attending open houses and informationals, I strongly believe that the SEC's mission aligns strongly with this idea. I would love to further contribute to the growth of future engineers just as I did through my developmental work in FRC.",
            "Question 8": "A huge challenge in running a school club is longevity. In both high school and college, you are only there for a maximum of four years and then must foster new talent to keep the organization alive. When I took the reins as vice president of my robotics team, this was painfully clear to me. All our talent was placed in the hands of seniors that would be graduating within a year, and we did not have a training program set up. As a result, I requisitioned and organized all the technical and administrative teams under my jurisdiction to focus on recruitment and training. Very few were eager about this since it would negatively impact our performance during the season. But I knew that if we did not make that move, the team would likely dissolve within a few years. As a result of this move, we were able to recruit over 60 people throughout the year and train a whole new batch of future engineers. Now, we have incredibly talented underclassmen and juniors heading some of our most important technical teams. Looking back at the team has now been one of the most reassuring and rewarding experiences for me.",
            "Question 9": "I would create a new initiative focused on improving the conversational skills of TAMU engineers, outside of strictly professional banter. Being able to develop a meaningful human connection with your client or employer is crucial to succeeding in any profession. It makes you more likable and allows for more direct, effective communication which inevitably leads to a drastic increase in professional efficiency. The program would focus on the psychological and social aspects of communication and casual conversation. We would have professors or other experts in psychology and communication come in and lay down general guidelines and suggestions for being more socially successful. As a result, engineers will not only be more successful in their careers (securing promotions, bonuses, etc.) but also be more likely to enjoy their work. In my opinion, that is the ultimate goal when going into industry."

In my own experience, I\u2019ve worked with classmates from different engineering fields on group projects. I enjoy learning from others and sharing what I know, so the whole team benefits. This kind of teamwork makes the project better and helps everyone feel more confident about their skills. I also try to help younger students whenever I can.

            "Question 8": "When I first graduated high school, my initial plan was to attend Texas State University for architecture. However, from the moment I arrived, something felt fundamentally off. I found no enjoyment in my classes, felt disconnected from the campus environment, and had an overwhelming sense that I didn\u2019t belong. Although my family assured me it was likely just first-day nerves, I recognized that this discomfort ran deeper. Trusting my intuition, I made the decision to withdraw the following day. At the time, many around me questioned my choice and suggested I had made a rash decision. Yet, I knew myself well enough to understand that I wasn\u2019t in the right place. I took a step back, working full-time at two jobs while considering my options. On a whim, I applied to Texas A&M\u2019s College of Engineering. To my surprise and excitement, I was accepted. From the moment I stepped onto campus, I felt at home. I loved my classes, the school\u2019s culture, and the students I met. The stark contrast confirmed that I had made the right choice. Reflecting on the experience, I\u2019m proud that I trusted my instincts, even in the face of doubt and criticism.",
            "Question 9": "I\u2019ve often thought it would be exciting if A&M had a club dedicated to bridging the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world application. Such a club could provide students with hands-on project opportunities that not only help them gain practical experience but also give them meaningful stories and solutions to share during interviews. I'm sure I'm not the only student at A&M that's been told after an interview to come back with more experience. This cycle is frustrating, as it\u2019s hard to build a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without that first opportunity. Imagine if this club took on practical, real-world problems, like the often-sticking sliding doors at zach. Fixing an issue like that would not only enhance the campus environment but also give students real talking points during career fairs or interviews. I know many fellow engineering students who would eagerly join a club that offers these types of real-world, hands-on experiences. By tackling practical challenges, students could break the \u201cno experience, no job\u201d cycle while also making a positive impact on campus. Over time, this club could become a defining resource at A&M, helping students stand out to employers and ultimately strengthening the reputation of Aggies as highly capable, experienced engineers."

My parents were both born in Venezuela, moving to Houston right before I was born. My parents main endeavor was to provide extra opportunities for myself and my two sisters. I understand because of what my parents went through what it feels like to not possess the same opportunities that others have. In doing so, I have done the same throughout my youth to give opportunities, whether big or small, to other people who may be of interest.

            "Question 8": "Last summer, I had the great opportunity to work for two different companies. By most, I was encouraged to continue pursuing those two jobs. However, I decided to commit fully to just one of the companies, and drop the other job. I believed that it would be better to focus on one job and know what it means to master specific skill sets rather than simply \"work\" more for the money. While it may be true that I could have made more money working on two jobs simultaneously, the skills I acquired would result in more finances in the future. In the end, the commitment towards one job ended up being a good decision. My improving work earned the trust from my superiors which led to more working hours (hours which replaced the money issue from not taking two jobs). Additionally, I was honored with receiving an Employee of the Month award.",
            "Question 9": "If I were to create a new project for the SEC, I would like to propose an event where a group of upperclassmen host scheduled meetings (perhaps monthly) targeted for freshmen in order to help and encourage them initiate professional advancement and maturity. Throughout the year, the hosts will begin each meeting with a small introductory game, emphasis on small or brief. After that the host will go over the certain basics of engineering professionalism such as: wardrobe, communication, ethics, etc. The point of this event is to give an extra opportunity for very young engineers to be introduced to professionalism and other freshmen. This event I believe could have a great impact on freshmen, especially those who are afraid to take the next step forward. Additionally, upperclassmen can also get a good experience on what it means to lead an event or group. Essentially, the point is to lead true freshmen towards the path of success as early as possible, before too much time is lost in their collegiate careers."

We are problem solvers, creative thinkers and some of the most determined people on campus.

            "Question 8": "As a counselor at the American Legion's Texas Boys State program, I was tasked with overseeing 34 High School Juniors for a full 120 hours in the city of Austin. It was difficult maintaining order of the 34 young men, especially seeing many were my same height, age and some even taller. However I was placed in a position of leadership, so lead, I would. The most challenging instance of this was when the responsible decision did not coincide with popular opinion. Specifically, One afternoon the boys decided they would skip lunch in order to practice for their debates. I admired their dedication to preparation, however skipping lunch posed safety and liability concerns. As their director, the decision was mine to make. The kids would not skip lunch. The decision was met with reluctance and disapproval by a significant number of statesmen. Seeing their disappointment, I addressed their concerns, resolved their preoccupations - I offered to help them with their debate preparation and give them tips on public speaking - and explained why it was important we take this course of action. This defused the situation and maintained the productive and constructive environment so integral to the program.",
            "Question 9": "I love the panel talks hosted by the SEC, the industry nights as well. Those two events are really insightful, especially for freshmen still trying to figure out what exactly they want to do within the field of engineering. However I would explore the possibility of a mini internship sort of program. A better way to put it is a \"day in the life\" event. Where a student that meets a selected criteria, perhaps requirements of GPA, involvement, maybe a submitted interest essay is paired with a professional in an industry of mutual interest and works under them for a day or two. The student just tags along the professional's day to day and observes what it is like to be an engineer of that specific profession. The student could also work in an \"assistant\" capacity, if they prove to be reliable enough. I feel this would be a great opportunity for students that are clearly passionate and interested in a field to get a realistic view of how a day in their future might really go."

            "Question 8": "When I was applying to college, my family wanted me to stay local and not go too far away, especially my parents. They didn't want me to live outside of our house therefore I had to go to a college that wasn't too far away. They weren't trying to be controlling, but I knew that they just didn't want me to be away from them for weeks to months at a time. I politely insisted that while I understood their desires, I didn't want to go to any of the local colleges. It took a lot of convincing and pleading for them to understand my perspective, which was that I wanted the best opportunity for myself, and sometimes that means sacrifice. I was able to convince them to at least let me apply and see where everything went from there. Once I had gotten into A&M, which was about 3-4 hours away from our house, I had to convince them that this was a really good opportunity for me. Ultimately, they caved in after months and months of arguments and debates and I got to go to A&M for engineering.",
            "Question 9": "I would try to expand the recruitment and target more kids since increasing the number of kids who are interested in engineering would increase the quality of students in the coming years. The specific objective would be to raise the number of meetings and assemblies that promote engineering at Texas A&M in elementary and middle schools in the state and around the country. This part of life is where the interest in engineering starts for many. Increasing the number of students interested in not only engineering but engineering at A&M would benefit the university in the long run in several different ways. Firstly, having more potential candidates would help increase the quality of students getting in. Next, more people would recognize Texas A&M Engineering for the good program that it is, which would help current students a lot more in regards to getting the jobs they applied for. The last major impact would be on the future graduates who would continue this cycle and keep A&M as a great university. Having more fellow members help with this would make a larger impact and having the legacy of A&M continue comes down to recruiting the next generation of talent."

However, we had yet to design our poster to be presented, but we still had more data to collect. We argued about whether to continue without the data and go headfirst into writing or acquire the data first and write with the little time we had. I was deliberate about finishing the acquisition of data, so I decided that I would collect the data on my own while the rest of the group focused on writing. Some wanted to assist in the lab, and others thought I should write as well, but I was adamant about just one of us finishing the work.

Students would be able to talk with professors and current students of the various programs so they could get more of a discussion and personal opinion than seeing data thrown on slides. Additionally, some of the less known courses available to all engineering students could be open for preview as well, within some of the various classrooms. Not only would this be beneficial to students this would help the university as well, expanding the involvement of the starting class and spreading awareness of all the different programs, courses, and organizations a freshman student can partake in. The main objective of the open house would be to assist Freshmen in choosing their major and finding student organizations they find a connection with while raising awareness of all the opportunities for an Engineer on campus."

I strongly value leadership that blends ethical responsibility with creative problem-solving, particularly when addressing real-world challenges. Whether in academic settings or personal projects, I make it a point to approach challenges with an open mind, seeking creative solutions while considering their broader impact on people and the environment. I\u2019ve also taken on leadership roles in group settings, encouraging team members to think critically and act with integrity. This balance between ethical decision-making and innovation has guided my personal and professional growth, aligning closely with SEC\u2019s mission to inspire responsible leadership in engineering.",
            "Question 8": "During the development of the Hybrid Autonomous Intersection Management (HAIM) protocol, our team faced several issues related to differing opinions on how to approach the signal control algorithms. Some members were eager to incorporate complex, machine learning-based approaches to optimize traffic flow, believing they would provide superior performance in handling dynamic traffic conditions. Others, however, were concerned about the stability and reliability of such algorithms, especially in real-world traffic scenarios where data might be incomplete or noisy. To resolve these issues, I took the lead in organizing open discussions where everyone could voice their concerns and suggestions. I emphasized the importance of finding a balance between innovation and practicality, making sure that the chosen solution was both advanced and stable. We decided to implement a hybrid approach, using machine learning for traffic prediction but relying on a more traditional control algorithm for decision-making to ensure robustness.",
            "Question 9": "For the Student Engineering Council (SEC) at Texas A&M, I would propose an initiative focused on sustainable engineering solutions in student projects. This would be called the Sustainable Engineering Innovation Challenge (SEIC), encouraging engineering students to incorporate sustainability into their design and innovation processes. This initiative would empower students to think critically about the environmental implications of their work and introduce them to innovative methods of incorporating sustainability into their designs. It would also strengthen SEC\u2019s role in shaping responsible engineers who are prepared to meet global challenges."

Being unfamiliar with aerospace engineering I saw this as an opportunity to not only learn outside of my interest in biomedical engineering but to also grow in my ability to work with different groups of people stemming from various backgrounds. I provided input and demonstrated teamwork and time management skills when planning the project. Relating to SEC, the goals of the society and graduate relations aligns with my belief to diversify and unite the engineering community towards creating an uplifting and supportive environment.

            "Question 8": "This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at a research and antibody production lab. During my time there, I was tasked many times with creating polyacrylamide gels, vital for performing one of the main types of experiments run in the lab. Numerous times I had either let the gels polymerize too fast or created leaks. After countless mistakes, I finally asked the lead scientist to show me how he did it and tried to learn first hand from the best. To my surprise, he too allowed the solution to polymerize too fast. The next day, I made the decision to create a chart of ratios and timings for the polyacrylamide gel formations. Although I did not get much disagreement from my fellow researchers, I was the only undergraduate in a new and intimidating environment and role. I took this as an opportunity to show my determination to go above and beyond in what I did. Now, my work is still being used in the lab today by new interns and research assistants, and I am glad I went out of my comfort zone to do so.",
            "Question 9": "I would propose an event called Engineer\u2019s Inferno, based on the popular TV dating show theme of matchmaking with stakes and eliminations. In this event, students will be put together in a room and urged to make teams with other members with different experiences, majors, and personalities. They will be tasked to solve a problem given a scenario with very few resources. For example, some students may have to solve the problem of drainage issues in urban cities given only a minimum budget. When students are ready, they present their ideas to judges. The winners get a higher budget in the next round, or more tools to better their device/innovation, and must switch teams. After 3-4 rounds, teams will be able to present their favorite innovation with their favorite team to a panel of judges, where there will ultimately be one winning team. This challenge would allow students to grow in their competitive engineering mindset as well as teach them to work with students of various different backgrounds and learn what types of teams they work best in. It also allows them to delve into the engineering design process in a high stakes environment."

In high school, I gave a speech to the City Council about building a swim facility that could be shared by my swim team and the community at large. This was the first time I had done a large service act and it felt amazing to think that I could have introduced someone's new favorite sport to them. But as I think of how I want to evolve while participating in more clubs/projects, I shouldn\u2019t solely be fueled by my own passions. I want to learn about my new community of engineering students. Being a part of a club that orchestrates outreach will help to shape my understanding of the world around me.\nI hope to bring my experience in this to SEC",
            "Question 8": "In high school I was junior captain of my swim team. It was a week before regionals when our Coach\u2019s husband had a heart complication and had to stay in the hospital under close watch. The team had 2 decisions: miss regionals or go without a Coach. This was tough, there was a lot of behind-the-scenes work that the captains would have to juggle along with swimming our own races. I was a big proprietor of going even though Coach wouldn\u2019t be there, I knew we could handle it. I got pushback from a lot of other swimmers, saying that they aren\u2019t comfortable going without a Coach. However, my ideas were backed by the other captains, and so we went. Despite not having a coach, the women\u2019s team got 6th overall and the men\u2019s got 9th.",

Eventually it led to me watching multiple videos on nuclear reactors, engines, and machines of all kinds. Consequently, increasing engineering awareness is the part that resonates the most with me. As kids we take almost everything for granted. We never think about how engineers facilitated the most important aspects of our lives because we never experienced or wondered how it was before. Whenever I was introduced to how different machines worked I marveled in their ingenious simplicity and effectiveness. It is the introduction of engineering and science that can unlock a kids imagination. With enough training that kid can translate the imagination into reality. Even adults are fascinated by the new inventions that simplified their life's. After watching videos on how things work, I tell and teach my parents about the subject, they were fascinated.",
            "Question 8": "During high school I had two friends that really disliked each other. I don't specifically know what happened between them and why they were in such a situation. For a long time I usually saw one or the other but never them together. Whenever I asked others what they had going on they were reluctant to say and preferred to stay out of their business. Almost everyone just accepted the way they were and never bother talking to them about it. Near the end of high school I talked to one of those friends while eating at a restaurant. I advised him to forgive the other friend. Reminded him that the past already happened, and that the only thing in his control is to either forgive him or hate him for the rest of their lives. If he forgave him they might be in good terms, if he kept angry with the other friend then he will just have to live with that his whole life. After a lengthy talk about the subject, he agreed. Now that I am in college I heard that they forgave each other and are now friends.",
            "Question 9": "I would create an initiative that would concern mainly college or high school students. It would be a competition, or like a school project, that would take around a week. In the competition, different groups would be given an everyday object, product, or machine. The groups would have to make a presentation about how the object works and then invent a better way to do that objects purpose. Maybe even invent a way to improve upon an objects weakness in their design. In the 21rst century there are fewer and fewer inventions and more and more improvements. Products get upgraded again and again, but we don't get anything new, an alternative. In the future there might be a lack of complete innovation, companies just improve instead of inventing a product. It would also teach participants that there is not a single way to solve a problem, and force them to find another way to solve it. We might get stuck solving a problem because we know its solution, we just solve it the same way again and again. What if there is a different way, and what if that way is a better solution."

The first thing I had attended when I was a Freshman was the first year career fair which helped me better understand what the recruiters were looking for. Where I would best be able to be suited for is the Finance side of the Development division because since I was in fourth grade I have also been managing money.

Managing inventory and the money, finding what snacks the people enjoyed buying along with what equipment they needed in order to prioritize restocking efficiently.

            "Question 8": "A difficult decision my family and I had to make was when we were deciding what to do with our first bull born in our farm the reason for this was because as bulls get older, they want to mount all the cows on the ranch which includes his mother which posed a difficult decision in whether we should give it away or keep him. I wanted to get rid of him whereas my father and the rest of the family wanted to keep him. We thought of many solutions, but we knew we had to have a solution where the bull wouldn\u2019t try mounting his mother in the end. I had to be able to understand that there was more than one solution to fix it. We were able to come up with a compromise by splitting the fence in half in order to still keep the bull. With the help of my brother we were able to add the fence post and it worked out for the better at the end.",
            "Question 9": "A new initiative the SEC could do is something like \"Getting to Know the Engineer,\" where you're put in groups at a couple of tables, and everyone keeps shuffling around maybe like every 10 minutes just getting to know the people at each table. Or it could be set up where there's a recruiter at each table, and it\u2019s more of a casual conversation about why they chose their career and how they got to where they are. To make it even more valuable for the engineers, it could be someone from their specific major because it would provide a lot of insight knowledge."

I really enjoyed seeing all the different branches of the organization that serve different purposes. I personally believe in always fostering a proper environment for like-minded people to enable them to make their ideas come to fruition and this organization specializes in that.

            "Question 8": "This past summer I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in the IRAP program abroad with the school to Yucatan, Mexico. The purpose of the trip was to learn about how research is done and then apply all that you learned by getting in a group and proposing a possible research idea that benefit both Yucatan and Texas. We were allowed to choose our own topic so my group and I started brainstorming ideas but it seemed that some of the group was not very enthusiastic about the project, which led them to propose very basic topics for the sake of finishing the project quickly. I did not want to be a buzzkill but I also wanted to show the school that the program was quite educational and believed our group was capable of much more. I explained how a stronger topic would not only make our research more interesting but also show that the faculty did a great job preparing us. To make sure everyone was onboard, I took it upon myself to suggest ways to divide the tasks fairly to streamline the process. Although there was hesitation, we ended up producing a proposal we were all proud of.",
            "Question 9": "Something I struggled with during high school was the lack of career guidance in detail, especially in regards to engineering. I felt that engineering as a concentration was not very well explained but rather thought of as a genre of study, such as math, language, science, rather than showing all that engineering is about and its real world applications. I really only chose engineering because I come from a family of engineers that have shown me their impact on the world around them and all they do to enable others to accomplish their goals. If I could create a new initiative, it would be to show younger peers a true hands on experience of what it is like to problem solve as an engineer and all the different fields any engineer could enter. I believe this would expose a younger audience to a field where their skillsets could thrive which would have a great impact on our future generations of engineers."

Through failing a class, ETAMing a year late, and doubting myself through it all, I always wished I had some sort of guidance. The SEC mentorship program would've changed the trajectory of my path greatly. This means a lot to me because neither of my parents are engineers, nor did they go to college in the US. On campus, I've had the opportunity to serve as an officer and a director of a FLO and a Fish Camp Counselor and got to provide lots of guidance for freshmen in a different capacity, getting acclimated to their new environment. I truly believe a leadership role is more than just completing tasks, but a calling to demonstrate our core values on a bigger scale and be a role model.",
            "Question 8": "As a director of a FLO, it is our job to collect dues from every freshman. For us specifically, we collect them in cash. When one of my fellow directors, simultaneously one of my close friends, came to me and told me they had misplaced $400, I had to immediately pick between one of my two sides: supportive friend or director. I wanted to console them as it is an extremely stressful situation to be in, but I also had to start problem solving. Throughout this time, it was difficult to set a boundary between compromising my friendship and doing what was in the organization's and the freshmen's best interest. After about a week of continuously searching and talking with another fellow director, we had come up with a plan to reimburse the money without asking our friend to just immediately come up with $400. Because a lot of our major financial events occur in spring, we set up a payment plan and offered to help to ensure that the organization didn't feel any sort of loss. We guaranteed the best case scenario! Our friendship never wavered and I was always cognizant of never putting them into an impossible scenario.",
            "Question 9": "A potential project idea could be connecting with local companies in the Bryan/CSTAT area, or even the Houston area to offer \"one-day shadowing opportunities\". By connecting with these companies, we can determine what engineering majors they typically hire and ask if they would be willing to host 8-10 students for a work day. Students that sign up for the same company can also be assigned a carpool as well, so they can also benefit socially from the experience. Unlike Industry Nights, this allows students to form more personal connections, and gain a more realistic glimpse in what a day in the life of a specific engineer looks like. This can help students pick between specialty tracks, or even encourage minors! Seeing real life applications to their hard work in school can help motivate students here on campus and gain understanding on what an engineer really does. Back when I was a freshman engineer, I honestly could not have told you what an engineer does on a day to day basis. I wish I had an opportunity like this to learn and be exposed to the industry before I ETAMed."

            "Question 7": "What resonates most with me is the SEC\u2019s mission to bring engineering awareness to other outside the engineering world. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have much exposure to engineering or didn't really have an understanding of the many paths it offers. It wasn\u2019t until college that I truly saw its potential to solve everyday problems that drive innovation. This experience made me passionate about helping others discover what I didn\u2019t know sooner. So now even if its small like talking to family and friends I try to show the importance of engineering.",
            "Question 8": "I have had to make many tough decisions that were not the most popular throughout my life, one that sticks out to me is when I was a coach for a little league 7 on 7 football team and I was in charge of making sure each kid got the playing time that their parents paid for even though sometimes the kids that were playing were not the best on the team. Every time one of the kids that was maybe not as good as the others when onto the field I would hear complaining from the kids themselves and some of the parents that they wanted to win and not cater to the worst players. However I kept my promise to make sure each kid got to play the right amount of time.",
            "Question 9": "A new project that I would start for the SEC would be major workshops. As when students get into a major sometimes they can be overwhelmed with how broad their major is and don't know what they specifically want to do within their major. A workout can help narrow this field and potentially help students choose which elective classes they should take their senior year to make a transition to industry smoother."

I gained my desire to self-improve once I got into high school, as I was hit by the aftereffects of all the academic stagnation during middle school. I gained my desire for self-improvement during my time crawling out of my academic sinkhole eventually ending with my all \"A\" senior year where I got a GPA of 4.83 and got an average AP score of 4.5 for the year. I believe in giving everyone the tools they need to help improve themselves further, as those tools students can help define for themselves what aspects of their majors they enjoy or if they want to go to another major. I also think having those tools can help foster a stronger environment of mutual self-improvement and can foster an environment where everyone becomes better versions of themselves.",
            "Question 8": "During my senior year, I along with my friend Matthew were the co-presidents of my school's Model UN club and we needed to decide how to redesign the club, as it had been very dysfunctional for years, existing despite a lack of any organizational effort. Matthew and I were split on how to redesign the club, as I wanted to use the club to teach speaking and debating ability, while Matthew wanted to focus more on the club's competitive aspects. Through the will of our club sponsor, my approach towards the club was to be emphasized and it caused a much larger number of new members for that year, though this approach angered some of the pre-existing members of the club who wanted to focus on their competitive ability. After both Matthew and I figured out our lesson plan for the more instructional elements of the club we started taking out time for more competitive practice to soothe the conflict with the pre-existing members. That year ended up being our club's best competitive year in a long time, as the instructional lessons allowed the new members to become very engaged with the club bringing a much-desired new life into MUN.",
            "Question 9": "A helpful new initiative would be a new form of marketing to the engineering student body to showcase SEC or Department of Engineering-associated events. This is important because as an A&M student, it's extremely easy to not hear about anything besides the biggest events. I think the best way of going about it is to place non-typical signage near the two major entrances of Zachry that are always there and reliably kept up to date. The best way to present this signage would probably be through a calendar of events that is placed in a way to become something students could easily habitually check. The problem with current picketing and tables is that both are easy to ignore as background noise to a student walking to class or some specific area of Zachry because of how common both are. If the sign was placed so that the average student would register its presence and quickly read what's available, then those events would likely become better known. Furthermore, if said events sounded interesting to a student they would likely look up more details on the SEC's website."

            "Question 8": "Back in freshman year, while I was playing basketball, some guys came to the courts to throw a football around. I wanted to join in, and after throwing the ball for a while, they asked me if I wanted to join their team for flag football. Flag football is one of my favorite sports, and I didn't get many opportunities to play it growing up, so I was excited to say yes and begin practice. Before I agreed, however, I had to painfully remind myself that though I love the sport and would be able to help their team, I have had three concussions and have had more injuries than I can count. Because of this, I knew it wasn't smart to join the team and play an entire season, so I had to decline. Though they were upset since they needed a girl for their team and had trouble finding one, I had to prioritize my health to make sure I could continue doing things in other areas of my life. It was a hard decision for me because I had to sacrifice present enjoyment for future benefit, but today I still get to do things I love.",
            "Question 9": "One initiative could be finding a way to allow high school students to participate in competitions we have here at Texas A&M, like Aggie Invent. High school students could be given the option to join a team as an extra member and gain hands-on experience on how to work in a team on real-world problems with older students that could offer insight into engineering.\nAnother initiative could be regular guided tours around the FEDC, teaching students about what machines do and what they can be used for. This could excite kids to work with a more hands-on approach rather than sticking to the classroom until labs begin. It could also inspire students to work on their own projects and ignite new ideas."

This past summer I had spent two weeks in the boundary waters on the border of Minnesota and Canada, where I had to lead a local youth group through the remote waters. On a particular day, however, the weather was stormy, and we were low on time. Due to the size of the waves, it could have been dangerous to cross. The two other adults in the group were split on whether or not to continue, and I was the one who decided. I had decided that while it may be a little dangerous, it was not anything more than what we had already handled. Ultimately, we crossed the lakes and set up camp with just enough time for fishing before dinner.",
            "Question 9": "I would create a new initiative that connects with local school districts and allows them to send students to the university to spend a day on campus to experience what it's like to be in the labs and go to class. SEC members will have groups shadow them through 2 prerequisite courses so the students can see what they are up for. The students will also have a chance to visit the Zachary Labs to familiarize themselves with the equipment before college. Overall, this program will allow students to get a feel for college life before college life."

I did something similar in my high school when me and my friends started the school STEM club.

My father already had said I was not allowed to keep and while my sisters had said I should I essentially had to make the decision to find a proper home where it now stays with one of my close friends. This decision, although hard, was made as it would not properly be taken care of as I do not have the means of getting it the help it required, especially with my dad not contributing to help it. In addition, I was about to leave for college around this time so it would be in a household with people either not wanting its presence or are not equipped to care for a kitten.

During my time talking with them they had advised me to look at certain power companies pertaining more towards my desired field of electrical engineering. While they were very helpful, an event similar to industry night with more generalized engineering majors I feel would be so beneficial overall to many other engineering students."

With such a large college campus there are bound to be freshmen who find themselves in a new world with too many options and not enough direction. Programs like DI Saturday and ESO Open House exist to offer underclassmen direction, and it\u2019s admittedly comforting to feel like you know when you\u2019ve always been lost. Even when members aren\u2019t at events whenever I\u2019ve met them in public they always are the most helpful kind of people when it comes to feeling like you just know what to do. In this sense of helping others, I know I could do great things for SEC. I\u2019ve done Fish Camp, made spreadsheets on possible housing options for freshmen friends, been a big in a FLO, and so much more.",
            "Question 8": "Friendships are fickle things. Sometimes you have to deal with conflicts where there really is no right answer. It\u2019s likely that whoever is reading this has faced conflict among friends, so I\u2019ll skip any more dramatics and talk about one of my experiences. I had a long-standing friend group that seemed perfect. It\u2019s difficult to surmise a decade of friendship into a sentence, but beyond words they meant a lot to me. So, it was difficult when relationships started to fall apart, and I got dragged into picking sides. I like to think that I surround myself with genuine people, but it took a lot to take a step back and reevaluate my own friends. In the end, I knew that I had to learn to disagree with people that I cared about. Sticking to the facts and ignoring your emotions can certainly be a difficult decision, but I learnt the value in being honest with myself, how to not doubt myself, and how to just live with the fact that sometimes not everyone will be happy with you. I hope I\u2019ll never have to do it again, but decisions are a part of life.",
            "Question 9": "I understand that SEC certainly gives back to the community in a number of ways such as E-day or Big Event, but I believe that more can always be done to help others. For example, I\u2019m surprised that SEC has no dedicated philanthropy. Many other organizations both within A&M and beyond have a declared philanthropy, and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with not having one, I think that having a sort of flagship philanthropy helps in a number of ways. Any idea that SEC decides to push would so easily attract so much attention passively because it would end up at any banners, presentations, and other marketing SEC performs. Even more importantly, it causes a mentality shift amongst an organization just by simply knowing that much of what you do is for the community. It\u2019s hard to explain or exemplify, but putting the betterment of a cause has a trickle down effect to all aspects of an organization and can certainly improve the characters of those who learn to care. SEC has so much reach and manpower that I truly believe dedicating more to events such as fundraisers, volunteering, advocation, and donation drives could see immediate results."

I handled the situation civilly, reiterating the fact that I was not as skilled as they were and that I would join them once I gained more experience.

            "Question 9": "I would enhance the social aspect of Student Engineering Council, so that engineering students may find solace in each other. This initiative would strengthen the bond between SEC members as well as improving the members mental well being. This could be accomplished through study days, social nights, and other various activities."

            "Question 7": "As an existentialist and member of the intelligent class I find it my cosmic duty to further the human race by studying engineering. I've learned not many people share this thought process. I was criticized to the core of my being by someone who said all engineers think they're better than everyone, and to some extent your mission statement is a direct antithesis to this line of reasoning. To bolster in the unknown and solve the problems which require thoughtful and knowledgeable solutions is at it's core the purpose of an engineer. To do what no one else is doing. To solve the energy crises, to solve the water crises, fix everything. That resonates with me.",
            "Question 8": "I had the difficult decision on whether to go to TAMU or UHCL, which would've been cheaper and allowed me to live at home. I chose to go to A&M off a recommendation to read a book called, \"Do the hard things.\" The principle that anything rewarding in life must be from a difficult activity deeply resonated with me, and the decision was more or less unswayed in either direction by my peers. Thus I was left to my lonesome, and I chose A&M. The hardest thing I've ever done guided alone by my love of masochism and my father in heaven. Amen.",
            "Question 9": "At my community college my statics professor had a cool idea for a club similarly founded to SEC upon the principle of guiding engineers. It served more applicable in community college where student were not yet solidified into a major, but there are certain aspects of the TAMU engineering landscape, at least for the first semester freshmen of which I'm in class with, which I feel could be improved upon. For my ENGR102 class the group labs have a power point discussing working with bad teammates. But why is that? Why are there bad teammates? Being an engineer is by and large the most collaborative occupation you can enter into, and all of these freshmen are risking getting filtered because they refuse to function properly in a group scenario. I think an initiative which tries to amplify the importance of working as a team and de amplifying the nature of individuality which serves such little purpose in the engineering world would be perfectly suited for TAMU. I assume this might be a key reason you don't let freshmen into the club, which is fair, but even upper class men struggle with this behavior."
