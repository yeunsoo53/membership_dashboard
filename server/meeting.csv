“Clinical Professor in the Department of Management of the Mays Business School and Director of the Master of Science in Entrepreneurial Leadership degree program - An educator, entrepreneur, world traveler (around 60 countries depending on who is doing the counting), investor, mentor, author, and past/present member of several boards overseeing both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. Present business endeavors with meaningful involvement include insurance, software technology, real estate, and luxury jewelry. Present not-for-profit endeavors with meaningful involvement include Christian faith-based organizations with operations that are either focused in Aggieland or engaged in multinational activities. Fun facts - Ate camel hump while visiting Inner Mongolia (very much just fat and a little slimy as served there), was attacked and bitten by a lion in Africa (deserves some explanation), and I grew up on a family farm where milking cows by hand was a regular duty.”

It was great seeing everyone at ESO Open House this past week, another wonderful event! Don’t forget to be resharing SEC posts to your stories as this is a great way to spread the word about our events.

This week’s meeting will be in the Chevron Rooms (_whoop!!_). Just a reminder that there is no eating in the Chevron Rooms so please be sure to eat beforehand (or after if that suits your fancy). Additionally, we will be hearing a leadership minute from Victor and Ellie!
