            "Question 7": "The pillar of fostering professional advancement of all engineering students within the College of Engineering means the most to me because of the impact it creates. Serving on the Advancement Committee for my Freshman Leadership Organization, I have experienced and witnessed other younger engineers feel intimidated by the newfound professional and college world. Through planning various events such as resume workshops and company trips in my committee, I have seen firsthand how it makes a noticeable difference in an individual\u2019s confidence and motivation. Because the SEC facilitates valuable events, like career fairs, DI Saturday, industry nights, etc., I hope to be able to contribute fresh ideas and proposals that will help these affairs become less daunting. Thus, I hold the accessibility and continuity of professional advancement for engineers to be the most impactful.",
            "Question 8": "Working at the Bioengineering Lab at UTA, I messed up a lot. Purely receiving instruction through late-night Zoom calls and hundreds of emails, it was hard to digest new terms and process an entire dissertation. That summer, I assisted with two projects: analyzing zebrafish malformations and segmenting cardiomyocytes. I completed the first project, but I struggled with the second. I emailed my first batch of cardiomyocyte files to a graduate student, but I was denied, physically and emotionally, when she told me I processed the data incorrectly. I emailed her back more batches of files, but again and again, the files were disapproved. I was at my breaking point. However, I committed and intended to see it through. Eventually, after many tutorials, long nights, and cups of coffee, I segmented the files correctly.\nAlthough I was discouraged, my efforts served a definite purpose. Even though I worked for many hours going in circles, I discovered the significance of persistent struggle. It pushed me to become more resourceful and tenacious. It showed me how failure was normal and not a deterrent but a motivator and how the fruits of my labor could contribute to the betterment of someone else\u2019s.",
            "Question 9": "Serving as my high school\u2019s National Honor Society president, I was asked to create a project that could be accomplished during the pandemic. Inspired by the excitement of the library and my overflowing bookshelf at home, I had an idea. My proposal to create a donation drive for unwanted books to distribute to local classrooms and libraries was chosen as the spring service project to complete. Although coordinating drop-off locations, collecting novels, and sorting and distributing donated books could be considered monotonous, I found this process overwhelmingly fulfilling. Seeing the appreciation of teachers for new donations and the enjoyment of local kids made the energy spent worthwhile. The little conversations, like discovering a kid\u2019s favorite series is the Magic Treehouse or someone\u2019s motivation for becoming a librarian are memories that made me enjoy my time spent. I was so moved by the spirit of the community coming together that I also decided to spearhead a donation drive for provisions for a local homeless shelter. Ultimately, the unity and gratitude of the neighborhood gave meaning and purpose to my efforts and turned my minute role in an organization into something enjoyable that I will never forget."

            "Question 7": "The pillar that means the most to me is the \"representative voice of all engineering students\" pillar. This is the most important pillar to me because I am a huge advocate for providing opportunities for all voices to be heard, especially when it comes to engineering. In high school, I was involved with PLTW Engineering courses and VEX Robotics. I had the opportunity to speak on behalf of peers for many board meetings and district events about engineering. I used this opportunity to ask questions to different people in the engineering program to get multiple perspectives on the program and engineering overall. Not only did this help me become a better leader, but I also learned how important diversity in people and thought is when it comes to engineering and overall program success. Moving forward, I would love to continue to promote diversity and continue to represent all engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "During my first year of high school, I was assigned my first collaborative engineering project. I was partnered with one of my friends, Nathan. The goal of the project was to create a design that was able to travel across a room. Me and Nathan tried a couple designs, but ultimately failed the final test every time. However, us failing the test showed us how we could improve from an engineering standpoint, and a team management perspective. For the next four years (in robotics), I got to work closely with Nathan and several others, solving engineering design issues, and collaborating as a team. I learned effective communication methods, time management, and engineering design skills. I was able to use all of these skills in robotics by recording everything in an engineering notebook, and by managing the team. I am pleased to say that in my final year I won many awards for my work, including participating in the World VEX Robotics competition. If it weren\u2019t for my failure in class, and my many failures during those four years, I wouldn\u2019t have sought improvement and gained the engineering design skills and team management skills that I have today.",
            "Question 9": "One time I enjoyed doing work was when I got to teach elementary school students about keeping an engineering notebook. I volunteered to teach younger students about the engineering design process, and how to document it. This was a volunteer project my high school did to build an engineering network between younger and older students. I enjoyed this work for multiple reasons. For one, I enjoyed sharing something I am passionate about with others; engineering design. I am very passionate about engineering design and technical writing, so every opportunity I have that involves it I take. Also, this was a very rewarding experience. This is why I enjoyed working on this project so much. I was able to give back to a program that I love, and I got to pass on methods and concepts that helped me in my engineering career. Overall, I loved working on this project because I got to do engineering work while giving back to the engineering program in my community."

            "Question 7": "The pillar of professional advancement resonates the most with me due to my time within the Memorial Student Center\u2014through which the advising staff and developmental resources have helped me grow into the person I am today. It is my belief that the SEC is a special organization as its focus on professional development is embedded in the culture of the organization and has a positive impact on the College of Engineering as a whole.\nExposing students to developmental opportunities helps ignite their passion and curiosity to become more versatile and well-rounded individuals. This is their chance to push themselves and make mistakes so that as professionals: they can succeed and carry themselves at a higher caliber. If accepted into the council, I hope to employ this passion through the career fair committee with my abilities in event planning and operations, furthering the development of the engineering student body.",
            "Question 8": "Last semester, I experienced failure as Chair of my FLO. There were many disconnects between myself and several Assistant Directors in regard to the expectations and mission statement of the organization. I did a poor job providing them honest feedback\u2014my fear of conflict rendering me unable to correct misbehavior before damage was dealt. Additionally, at the start of their tenure, I failed to clearly communicate the expectations of their roles (meeting etiquette, social gathering policy, etc.), leading to inefficient meetings and inappropriate behavior. Parts of the outcomes were outside of my control (the fault being mostly on the individuals), but I was still able to identify ways I could grow and have since taken steps toward improvement.\nAlthough simple in nature, the changes I implemented have been impactful. The first was to improve accountability via drop-ins to subcommittee meetings. By being physically present (and honest when things were not up-to-par), low-performing teams were unable to slip through the cracks. The second was to consistently communicate with Assistant Directors the gravity of their roles and commitments and to assign consequences for misbehavior. These failures have ultimately taught me so much about the importance of accountability and clearly setting expectations early on.",
            "Question 9": "My main motivation for pursuing further leadership in MSC FISH was to positively impact the freshmen through the friendships, community service, and program development opportunities I can create. All of the countless emails sent, meetings facilitated, and collaboration with the Executive and Assistant Directions led to great personal and professional growth for the freshmen. This is extremely important to me because I personally grew tremendously during my time as a freshman, while also having a large impact on my community.\nThis was primarily accomplished through my work on Kyle Field Day, our annual day of service in Kyle Field. Having successfully put on this event with my team, I nurtured a lasting passion for program development. Specifically, I was responsible for developing a new team within the subcommittee, and this experience overall helped me grow into a better leader. I had to push myself past my comfort zone with public speaking and management and find creative ways to maximize our potential success. I enjoy the work that I do because I have the opportunity to impact the community, strengthen my relationship with my team, and grow into an even better teammate and leader every step of the way!"

Being able to contribute to the experience of the current and future students within the engineering program in a positive way is a mission I am eager to be a part of. I find it inspiring that students are enabled to have a voice through the Engineering Student Survey, which allows for engineering student responses to be heard by a multitude of staff that oversee the discipline. This survey was the first time in my educational experience where I could express any influential opinions over the curriculum. As a result this newfound voice relieved the angst created by the magnitude of this program and empowered me over my education. This is the feeling I hope to pass on to current and future engineering students in turn strengthening their influence upon their education.",
            "Question 8": "In highschool I would enter the audition process for the All-State band where the top musicians in Texas would earn a spot to perform together. I dedicated countless hours to this audition my freshman year and failed. Following this, I failed two years after that as well. The amount that I learned from these failures were integral for my eventual success senior year where I made the band utilizing the experiences from beforehand. I learned that progress is typically gradual and even when results may not be immediately apparent, it is important to maintain trust in the work that I was conducting. Within that work, I learned that the good practice was not just long practice, but efficient and focused as these practice sessions allowed for me to isolate things that I would struggle with rather than repeating parts that I was naturally good at which in turn propelled me to improve at a much faster rate. Naturally, I have applied this concept to my study approach as well as my involvement in my organizations such as FEST. This focus on the product rather than the time spent has drastically increased the quality of my activity within these two aspects.",
            "Question 9": "A time that I enjoyed doing work was working as a busser for a restaurant called Raffas. Within this position I had an extremely well defined role that I was able to follow and pursue throughout my shift with my complete focus. I particularly enjoyed working there after a few weeks when I became proficient in my position in turn aiding the team around me. This aspect maintained the sense of teamwork while allowing individuals such as myself as a busser and servers to fulfill their own duties independently. Additionally, I was tasked with training new employees entering my role while accomplishing the same quality of work that was expected of me normally. Although it may seem void of complexity, this job actually required a considerable amount of individual decision making, where my own judgment would have to prioritize separate aspects of the restaurant to maintain the most efficient flow. I enjoyed these responsibilities as they progressively taught me how to balance a multitude of tasks at a single time, consider my individual role within a larger system, and how to maintain a constant workflow despite unpredictable occurrences. I am fortunate to have learned these lessons through a firsthand experience."

            "Question 7": "To me, the most meaningful pillar of SEC is increasing engineering awareness. One of the causes I am most passionate about is inspiring girls to engage in STEM classes and careers. To achieve this goal, last year I created a program allowing high school students to visit the local middle school STEM class. My goal was to inspire middle school students, especially girls, to become involved in STEM in high school. Through interacting with, teaching, and performing labs and experiments with these middle school students, I strived to demonstrate that women are confident and worthy of being leaders in the STEM field. If accepted to SEC, I hope to join the EnVision Conference Committee to continue to uplift and support young students and women within STEM. It is essential we expose children to engineering at a young age so they will be inclined to pursue it in the future.",
            "Question 8": "As a high school senior, I served as captain of my varsity cheerleading team. Last January, we attended our biggest competition.\nUpon arriving, spirits were high. After an exceptional preliminary performance, I felt confident going into the final round. However, one of our stunts fell. I knew we had not performed our best when it counted.\nWhen results were announced, my team placed eighth. This was still an incredible accomplishment, but it was not what we hoped for. Seeing the disappointment on my teammate's faces, I felt like I had let them down. As captain, I questioned what I could have done differently,\nAs the disappointment consumed my thoughts, I heard some teammates complaining that the competition was rigged and we were unfairly scored. Instead of accepting our mistakes and being proud of our efforts, they were blaming others. I held an impromptu team meeting. I stood amidst my crying teammates and reminded them to be proud of our hard work and to lean into our camaraderie. I tried to instill, in both myself and my teammates, reminders of the lessons we gleaned from the process. With the benefit of hindsight, I realize even more the importance of those lessons.",
            "Question 9": "For the past four years, I worked as a preschool gymnastics coach. I planned and instructed classes for children aged three to five. Teaching preschool athletes, I focused on creating safe and kid-friendly activities to ensure a comfortable yet exciting environment. As I became more experienced, coaching quickly became the highlight of my week. I looked forward to seeing the kids\u2019 bright faces running through the gym doors every Saturday.\nOne of the young athletes I grew closest to was a little boy named Beckham. When Beckham first enrolled in my gymnastics class he was hesitant, but over time, he blossomed into a class leader. One Christmas, Beckham even handed me a card with a picture of the two of us together. I felt proud, knowing that Beckham appreciated me for instilling in him both persistence and confidence.\nCoaching brought me joy in seeing my student's growth over time. The excitement that radiated from my preschoolers when mastering a new skill made all the early mornings worth it. As a gymnastics coach, I found my true passion for making a difference in the lives of children, and I hope to continue to pursue this passion as a member of SEC."

Growing up, I was obsessed with making things out of scotch tape and printing paper. I was fortunate enough to have a Dad, an engineer, and Mom, an elementary school teacher, who supported me in what I loved to do: making things I thought were cool. When I got older, I would volunteer at my Mom\u2019s school for their science night. I enjoyed working with younger kids to explore new ideas. We still need engineers in the world who are passionate about learning and creating. The EnVision Conference aligns with my desire to bring awareness to kids who want to pursue a passion in engineering like my own.",
            "Question 8": "Last semester, I applied for a Sophomore Leadership Organization and I failed to get in. Being \u201cinvolved\u201d was pushed incredibly hard on me by my peers, and I thought of myself as unsuccessful if I wasn\u2019t involved. Just doing engineering homework and hanging out with friends was never painted as an idea of success to me. Of course, hindsight is twenty-twenty, and I realized that not getting into this SLO turned out to be a great blessing. For one, my semester courseload was very overwhelming for me, and I had to mature a lot. If I had been in the SLO, I would have either gotten completely overwhelmed or I would have gone inactive. I also remembered that the staff of the SLO were only a year older than me, and because of this, I didn\u2019t need to judge my worth based on whether I got in. I also grew in gratitude for what I had. I was incredibly privileged to be able to go to Texas A&M University. I also still considered last semester a great success. I maintained good grades, grew in discipline and time management, and grew in my relationships.",
            "Question 9": "I am in the Texas A&M Jazz band and sometimes I am tasked with performing an improvisation solo. I have to work in advance so that I can perform at my best. While the work can be challenging, I find a lot of joy in the process. When I practice, I get full creative freedom in what I want to play. There are very few things in my life that I get to fully express myself without critique or pressure. I get to relax and tinker with what fits with a song. I play the song in the background and I start playing notes. These notes are almost random at first, but I learn what notes sound good and I get my footing. I enjoy the little experiment I run, my musical hypothesis either being proven or disproven by the song. If I lose creative steam, then I take a break and listen to some great jazz artists. I imagine myself in their shoes and take musical inspiration from them. Soloing is rewarding to me because I get to design a process that produces a rewarding product. As a bonus, It also does not need debugging."

            "Question 8": "As president of KCYL, I was in charge of organizing a trip to attend a competition in Tampa. I worked with my board to choreograph multiple dances and a play for our cultural pieces. We also held volleyball and basketball practices every day. Though we had started over a month in advance, we did not get placed for any of the events. It was disappointing to see the hard work of our members not come to fruition. The countless practices, late nights spent mashing music, and our sore bodies were just not enough. As I watched my members expression turn from excitement to anguish I recognized that sometimes giving our all to something and not receiving anything in return is a blessing. It revealed that sometimes I should enjoy the little things such as dancing with my friends, learning new things, and creating memories. I realized that the title of winner is not nearly as important as experiencing the challenges on the way.

It was a time where we weren\u2019t stressed about school and instead gathered to represent our voices. Our task was to compare online versus in person schooling, and we threw ourselves into it, experimenting with various websites and tools to bring out ideas to life. We created a podcast cover and spoke passionately as we presented our project to the judges. Our hard work paid off as we placed second in the regional competition and went on to achieve third in the state championship in our senior year. The countless hours spent practicing and the unforgettable moments of laughter with my friends made this experience one that I will cherish forever."

Before transferring to the United States, I attended a different university: TU Delft, in the Netherlands. At TU Delft, there is little emphasis on professional advancement. As a result, I lacked curiosity about all the different opportunities available after graduation. However, this lack of interest changed when I transferred to Texas A&M. While attending the SEC Career Fair, I spoke to numerous recruiters from different engineering fields. These conversations and the research I did in preparation for the fair gave me a stronger sense of what I want to pursue after graduation. Fostering professional growth in the form of making connections with recruiters, encouraging internships, and promoting career curiosity, is something I would be honored to be a part of.",
            "Question 8": "As I neared the end of my first semester at TU Delft, I decided to transfer. Although I was unhappy in the Netherlands, it took considerable time to come to the decision. I was taking pre-requisite classes at a community college, and soon after, I started regretting my decision to leave. I felt this feeling of guilt and failure that I did not work hard enough to like it there. As the spring semester went on, however, I realized I did not miss being at TU Delft; rather, I missed being a mechanical engineering student at a university. Despite working very hard during my first semester in the US, the adjustment took a toll on my grades. Unfortunately, this led to me not getting into TAMU. I felt defeated as if all my hard work was for nothing. But rather than letting it deter me from my goals, I felt even more motivated. After one more semester at community college, my perseverance paid off when I got into Texas A&M. After my long, tedious journey to get into university, I realized persistence pays off. It made me appreciate my experience here at Texas A&M even more.",
            "Question 9": "Last semester, I was part of a short film crew from the aggie swamp filmmaking club. I wrote and managed pre-production but was not supposed to be directing it. However, one of the other members did not plan the shooting schedule, resulting in the crew moving at a much slower pace than anticipated. Since the larger scenes had ten people, there needed to be more planning. I realized we needed a different approach if we wanted to complete our shoot on the planned days. I discussed this with the current director, and we agreed to let me take over. I kept the pace up with a positive attitude and ensured our crew completed the shoot on time. Although the shoot itself was quite stressful, it was rewarding to see everything come together. It was also gratifying to be able to share the excitement of the final product with team members. Being able to proudly look at a final product with team members is one of the reasons I often enjoy team projects."

The principle behind this advice is sound, but the advice itself (at least for me) was incredibly confusing. After all, I didn't even know what most jobs actually did on a day-to-day basis, much less if I would enjoy them. In the end, I just decided to follow in my father\u2019s footsteps and become an engineer. Fortunately, this was the right decision for me, but it\u2019s only now that I\u2019m realizing that \u2013 in my second semester of college, far beyond a point of easy return. Surveying my peers, I know I wasn\u2019t alone in this confusion. Hence, spreading awareness about engineering appeals to me, as it\u2019d help those struggling in this future-job-tangle to make better decisions.",

The meeting\u2019s kickoff was optimistic, but as conversation proceeded, I grew tense.\nWe hadn\u2019t found a ringer yet, so the group had begun compromising for subpar ideas. As leader, I took control and cracked down, tearing into these weak ideas to expose their flaws and reminding the group of the higher standards we had set for ourselves.\nHowever, as I resumed the ideation process I noticed the group was subdued. No one wanted to suggest an idea and get interrogated about it, and despite my efforts, this status quo remained until the meeting end.\nIt was then that I realized I had failed as a leader; I had hampered the team\u2019s creativity, caused unnecessary tension, and - most importantly - failed to respect my teammates.\nSo I apologized to the team and arranged for another meeting.

            "Question 9": "Recently, I volunteered to help run A&M Science Olympiad\u2019s invitational tournament and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it \u2013 particularly since I had to wake up at 5 AM on a Saturday to do so.\nIndeed, I had originally only signed up to proctor and write tests for the event because I wanted to give back to the Science Olympiad community (I competed in Science Olympiad for seven years) and let the attending young junior high students a chance to experience a quality invitational. I thought I\u2019d simply do my shifts to the best of my ability and leave.\nBut on the day of, I found myself staying until the invitational ended. Beyond just proctoring, I organized paperwork, cleaned rooms, and assumed an unofficial leadership role as, to my surprise, other volunteers started turning to me for directions. Maybe it was because they could see my enthusiasm working with them.\nBecause, more than anything, it was the thrill of collaborating with a team to overcome challenges (we were working with junior high students: there were many) and, as effectively as possible, accomplish a worthwhile goal that had kept me volunteering at the invitational far longer than planned."

            "Question 7": "It is most meaningful to me to advocate for students because it opens ways to alleviate difficulties students face. The past year, I frequently heard about students\u2019 frustration with registration and academic advising. Deeply relating to their struggles as a student in General Studies, I wanted to resolve the problem created by a decentralized university system. I believed the system could be improved, and I was determined to ensure it was. Hence, the following semester, I ran for Student Senate, where I was able to work on a centralized website on academic affairs for students. Knowing how much students are overwhelmed with college, I was grateful that I could take away even a small source of frustration from their minds. Similarly, as a member of the Legislation Committee, I would like to hear the concerns of engineering students and initiate visible changes that can bring more relief and satisfaction.",
            "Question 8": "Last March, I was inspired by Pixar\u2019s Turning Red and its behind-the-scenes documentary, which prompted me to want to be part of the production process. From then on, a dream of working at an animation studio slowly grew in my heart. So last semester, I joined an organization called 2D Visual Developers(2VD) to gain more exposure in the field. But soon after, I stopped attending because it felt as if I were an Algebra 1 student in Calculus. It was intimidating and overwhelming to be surrounded by 30 visualization majors when I could barely doodle something presentable. I didn\u2019t know where to start or how to catch up if that was even possible. So instead, I decided to stick with places I felt competent, escaping the unfamiliar discomfort of 2VD. However, after watching Avatar 2 and Puss in Boots, I could not help but go back. This time, I signed up for the fundamentals mentorship and reached out to my mentor, who encouraged me to take it one drawing at a time. Though I still feel anxious, I decided to focus on fulfilling my day\u2019s work. With consistency, improvement will follow because today\u2019s drawing is already better than yesterday\u2019s.",
            "Question 9": "Student Senate meets biweekly to introduce, debate, and vote on legislation. Despite the length and formality of the meetings, I enjoy participating in them because they challenge me intellectually and morally in ways no one ever has. During three rounds of debate, I am responsible for evaluating both sides based on the information presented. In less than an hour, I need to formulate a decision that would represent the interests of my constituents. Lastly, I have to make a public standing vote with confidence. However, the process gets tricky when discussing controversial topics like lobbying for decriminalizing marijuana possession. Regardless of my personal beliefs, I need to determine under pressure what I believe is best for Texas A&M students on morally ambiguous matters. In those sticky situations, my peers have challenged me the most to reevaluate my beliefs and ideas, disagree with confidence, and defend my choices logically. It can be uncomfortable, but this is what makes these meetings truly meaningful and enjoyable. After all, we engage in open conflict because we know our purpose and responsibility is to serve the student body with intentional decisions that make a tangible, long-lasting impact on students."

As someone who personally struggles with this, I admire the SEC\u2019s mission to provide advancement opportunities to all students, whether that\u2019s through career fairs, industry nights, engineer\u2019s week, or other special events.\nI also grew up hearing stories from my immigrant parents about the risks that they had to take to advance as engineers in this country. These risks include taking low paying jobs and working longer hours in hopes of advancing within their companies. I believe that these risks are something that students shouldn\u2019t have to deal with and connecting Aggies to the right people will reduce this problem.\nOverall, continuing to connect engineering students to the right people will allow Aggies to gain experience, develop their technical skills, build their resume, and reduce risks before they go out into the real world.",
            "Question 8": "Nine out of ten startups fail, and when my first startup, Relics, an app that used the fluctuating prices of sports cards to educate kids about the stock market, failed, I became a part of that statistic.\nWhile it was difficult to get over the money, time, and hard work that went into my business, I eventually realized that my failure was just a part of my journey as an entrepreneur and leader.\nRelics showed me how to bring an idea to life, assess a market, and use presentation skills. However, aside from the lessons I learned as an entrepreneur, I learned valuable lessons as a leader. I discovered that I can\u2019t do everything on my own and behind every great idea is a passionate team. Overall, my biggest mistake was being too prideful to admit my weaknesses and would try to take on more responsibilities than needed.\nThrough this experience with my first startup, I\u2019ve become a better leader and entrepreneur. Most would be discouraged after their first business flops, but I\u2019ve decided to reflect on my mistakes and plan to use them as lessons to guide me in whatever my next business venture may be.",
            "Question 9": "Passing down my knowledge to younger generations is rewarding. Each year, my high school track team would host a track meet for our feeder middle schools. To most on the team, this was seen as a favor to our coach, but to me it served as a way to excite and mentor young athletes about running.\nBetween setting up hurdles and reporting times to the meet coordinator, I had the chance to talk to the middle schoolers about their races. Being a varsity athlete, they would question me on everything from my latest races, to my diet, to my letterman patches. With every conversation I had, I was reminded of a younger version of myself, curious and eager to improve.\nNot everyone sees running in circles as entertaining, but to me it has played a key role in who I am as a person today, so volunteering at this annual track meet allowed me to give back to the sport that has given me so much. Looking back at this experience, I hope that I inspired the younger generation of runners to continue to work hard and enjoy the sport."

I would love to be part of events such as Envision and REACH, which embody the heart of this pillar. Reaching out to underprivileged children and providing them with the resources to be successful in their academics would be the most rewarding experience. Showing children all that they can do with their future and getting them interested in STEM fields at a young age can open the door for them for so many opportunities. I want to help the SEC use the many resources we have been given through the college of engineering to help mentor and support the next generation of college students.",
            "Question 8": "My first semester at A&M was extremely difficult and left me feeling like I had failed my transition to college. I failed at getting into several FLOs and organizations that I wanted. I failed to obtain the perfect social and academic life I had planned. I felt lonely and struggled to find my people. I lost sight of the bigger picture and thought these failures would define the rest of my college experience. It was a hard few months, but instead of remaining defeated, I returned my second semester determined to make things better. I made efforts to make new friends, got involved in leadership in my sorority, joined Big Event Staff and Engineers Without Borders, and applied to study abroad for that summer. My life at A&M slowly improved, and without realizing it while it happened, my college life had made a complete 180. I learned to accept being rejected from clubs, jobs, and positions as a lesson and not something that defines me as a failure. I grew into a stronger and more resilient person. I learned that one failure will always teach you something for the next opportunity.",
            "Question 9": "I enjoy connecting with and helping fellow students through my job tutoring at the Math Learning Center on campus. Math has always been my favorite subject and something that comes naturally to me, and I love using my skills to help engineering students understand calculus and succeed in their first college math class. I know how hard the first year of A&M engineering can be, and providing an environment where these students feel safe and can easily learn is so important. I am able to build relationships with the freshmen that come in frequently, and provide advice and support in their first year of college. I feel I am in a position to make a real difference by helping students gain a strong knowledge of the math they will use in many future classes. As a tutor I am able to provide help that a professor of a class with over 300 people cannot give. I love seeing difficult concepts finally click for a student, and hearing about their success on a test. I enjoy this job more than any job I have had before, and I plan to continue it for the rest of college."

I come from a business-oriented family so growing up, I always thought I was going to go to college for accounting. In high school, I had a remarkable physics teacher who taught us to make us curious about the world around us. My physics teacher is one of the biggest reasons I went into a STEM field and I know the importance one person can make in helping people find out what they're passionate about and what they want to do. I am passionate about opening up the stem world and teaching science as a creative way of thinking rather than just numbers, especially to younger girls. That's why the EnVision conference interests me the most. Because one person opened my mind to engineering, I know how impactful an experience like EnVision could be.",
            "Question 8": "Growing up, I struggled a lot socially and developed a lot slower than my peers. I was never able to convey my thoughts and I failed a lot when it came to speaking and being able to hold a conversation. At the age of 14, I started working at my family's bakery, where my lack of social skills became a hindrance in my customer service role. However, this experience also became a turning point for me. I realized the importance of improving my social skills and took it upon myself to do so. I started to step outside my comfort zone and take steps that made me uncomfortable initially. Every time I would go to work or talk to a customer I made a conscious effort to talk a little bit more each day. My social skills have since grown exponentially and this has translated into my college experience. I now have a newfound confidence in myself and my abilities, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned these valuable lessons. My experience taught me not only social skills and confidence, but also how I can take little steps to learn any skill.",
            "Question 9": "From the age of 5-16, every summer I would go to an all-girls summer camp, but when I was 17 I graduated from camper to counselor. The next thing I knew I was in a cabin with a bunch of 9-year-olds all looking to me for what to do for the next month. Every day was a new challenge, but also an opportunity to learn and grow. I was given responsibilities such as running archery classes and working to help prepare for mealtime, and I embraced each one wholeheartedly. Pretty soon, I grew to love not only the community of the counselors but also the satisfaction of doing everything I could to make the best experience I could for the campers. I felt a sense of accomplishment when the campers would feel less homesick every day and would make the most of the camp I fell in love with. That month, I grew in maturity, explored my leadership capabilities, and learned so much about work ethic and working in a team. I will always cherish the memories and lessons I gained during that month and the opportunity to step outside my comfort zone."

When surrounded by diversity, people are forced to learn about different viewpoints, ideas, opinions, values, and cultures. I grew up in Guatemala for the first eighteen years of my life before moving to Texas for college a year and a half ago. Coming from a mixed background I have always been surrounded by inclusion and diversity. Texas A&M\u2019s community is benefitted from the diversity of students because of the diffusion of new perspectives and fresh ideas being brought by people with different experiences. Specifically, the college of engineering is a big mixture of cultures, nationalities, and backgrounds since it pulls people from all over the world because of its stellar reputation. I find the pillar of \u201c[striving] to be the representative voice of all engineering students\u201d most relevant and significant to me.",
            "Question 8": "My family took a trip to a friend\u2019s farm one summer not expecting it to become one of my worse memories and one of my biggest lessons.\nAfter 9 hours of driving, we encountered four men standing in the middle of the road shooting their guns at us. I quickly threw myself on the floor and pulled my sister down with me. Laying there trembling and trying to calm my sister down while also trying to make sure no one was hurt seems like such a distant and surreal memory. (Think of it like this\u2026It was as if I was inside a video game. My brain was all foggy. All I could think about was \u201cGAME OVER\u201d. There is nothing I could do but accept it. Facing the fear of my own death brought calm, but the death of the people around me didn\u2019t. Losing a loved one does affect me; it is not something I can just walk away from like a video game.)\nI got distracted and my sister came out from behind me to check out the scene. I turned back around to realize she was a very easy target because her head was right next to a window and I had allowed it. I pulled her back down and hugged her close to me, shielding her as best I could from the world outside. On this occasion taking care of my younger sister was my priority but I failed at it. Being the eldest of three sisters evidently comes with the responsibility of protecting your younger siblings and after this experience, I never forgot that. Being a leader on a team, not only in a family setting, comes with the responsibility of looking out for your team and not forgetting that you are there for them too.",
            "Question 9": "Currently, the medical field in Guatemala is extremely limited in equipment and resources they have. Most people in Guatemala do not have access to medical care; rural areas normally do not have a medical professional, much less any medical equipment. I started to work on medical mission teams that provide medical care to less fortunate individuals who have limited resources. It\u2019s hard work that most people shy away from because it\u2019s physically and mentally exhausting since you are multitasking as a translator, assistant, organizer, and even entertainer for the kids sometimes! By doing this, I have watched, assisted, and translated surgeries for international doctors, all while experiencing a diverse range of cultures. I became a bridge between doctors and patients, Guatemalan and American cultures. I enjoyed it so much since these experiences and interactions have guided my focus and made me a well-rounded individual; not only by sparking my attention towards the medical field and its technology & tools, but also showing me the privileges which come along with an education, and being part of a community. Evidently, these service events had such an impact on me that I chose my major, biomedical engineering, based on it."

However, despite Monterrey being an industrial city, the majority of its population is not interested in engineering. An unfortunate fact is that only the wealthy have exposure to STEM topics, while the average citizen would not know what an engineer does. There is the idea that math is hard and that being an engineer is far out of reach. Not only is engineering disregarded, but Mexico suffers from a large amount of brain drain. This has led to stagnation in technological innovation within Mexico. Witnessing these things has taught me how crucial engineering awareness is, which is why I would like to be a part of the EnVision conference. With a robot from robomasters, I could provide students with a tangible example of what is possible through engineering and ignite their imaginations.",
            "Question 8": "Going to college I came across TAMU Robomasters, a club I became infatuated with. I was drawn to the scale of the international competition that Robomasters participated in, however, the competitive nature that made it so appealing also made it difficult to join. I applied twice as a freshman and I got rejected twice. After being rejected the first time, I joined another robotics club to gain experience. Thinking that a semester of experience would be enough, I applied again. The second rejection made me question whether I was good enough to achieve my goals. I reached out to mentors and friends who all encouraged me to persist, and after much thought, I decided to not give up. This was the best choice I could have made, making the team on my third attempt. I learned the importance of persistence, but also that persistence without preparation and planning will not suffice. I learned that in times of struggle, relying on others who can push you in ways you can\u2019t push yourself is a strength. I am extremely grateful for being on my robotics team, not only because I accomplished my goal, but more so because I grew from my failure.",
            "Question 9": "In my senior year of high school, I was the cross-country team captain. This came with many responsibilities such as leading unofficial practice, reading book excerpts out loud before our runs, and having individual meetings with members of our family. There were five team captains with all teammates divided into random families. Every week I got to meet with a member of my family in a one-on-one conference. Not only did this allow me to connect with members of my team that I would have never met, but it also gave me a more diverse pool of opinions. These meetings were my favorite responsibility as a team captain and the largest reason why I enjoyed the role. Even if a team member was not the best runner, if I could have a small positive impact I would feel immensely satisfied. I have not had many experiences in my life such as this. Working towards a goal with someone while helping them with their growth was not a job I thought I would enjoy. But as I leaned into the role of a team captain, I realized that helping others succeed was one of the most enjoyable uses of my time."

The SEC aims to combat these statistics through two major committees: legislation, which surveys students and collaborates with the engineering deans to create imminent change, and internal relations, which fosters a community of belonging through social events and mentorship. Inspired by these measures, I desire to join the SEC to learn how to take initiative in a professional setting and gain the courage needed to take action.

            "Question 8": "Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for singing. I started taking lessons from the age of 8 and ultimately joined a performance-based extracurricular music school. My vocal coach at the school was incredibly supportive and encouraged me to perform at many events. I took pride in her support and never wanted to let her down.\nAlthough I was chosen to perform at a Christmas event hosted by the studio, because I knew the song well I neglected to spend time perfecting my performance and only briefly went over it on the day of the event. Unfortunately, when the show started I was dumbfounded: I had missed my cue and lost track of the lyrics. Despite the supportive crowd, the disappointed look on my coach\u2019s face shattered me. I had failed someone who continuously supported me.\nSince that day, I have always made it a priority to check my confidence and prepare thoroughly for everything I do. I utilize planning strategies and constantly remind myself that my performance is directly related to the effort I put in. These practices have helped me avoid similar situations and become a more responsible and reliable individual.",
            "Question 9": "When I first learned about Thirst Project, I was shocked to find that millions of people still lack access to clean water. Determined to finance a well for a village in Eswatini, my friends and I spent countless hours setting up a strategy to fundraise.\nAt first I found that my days were filled with demotivating work: creating plans that were often deemed unreasonable, contacting uncollaborative businesses and hosting low-yield fundraisers. However, every time I became discouraged, I reminded myself that even if we could help just one person, it would all be worth it.\nAs my team and I gained more exposure and experience, we became more effective in our fundraising efforts. Our events grew increasingly successful and ultimately we raised over $3,000 to donate to Thirst Project.\nKnowing that my team and I created tangible results and overcame obstacles together left me with a lasting sense of satisfaction. It was a true honor to be able to fill my days with work that I know has made a difference in the world and to have been a part of a story that demonstrates the power of hard work and perseverance."

I was caught off guard and didn't know how to handle the situation. I felt embarrassed and defeated, but I soon realized that this was just a setback. I made the difficult decision to Q-drop the class and take a step back to reassess my priorities and study habits. It was a hard pill to swallow, but I knew it was the best thing for me in the long run. After this experience, I became more humble and self-aware. I recognized that I needed to put in more effort and take my studies more seriously if I wanted to succeed. I started seeking help from tutors and attending office hours, and I made a dedicated effort to study and understand the material. Looking back, I am grateful for that failure.

            "Question 7": "The pillar that means the most to me is striving to be a representative voice for all engineering students. Initially, I was overwhelmed by the number of students at Texas A&M; I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to make a lasting impact. However, joining a leadership organization helped me to diminish this feeling, as it allowed me to understand the important role each student plays. This idea is further emphasized in SEC, where the student\u2019s voices are encouraged to shine and their contributions foster meaningful effects. Through detailed surveys designed to gain insight into the experience of engineering students, promoting the wellness of the students during engineer\u2019s week, and tabling around Zachry to support engineers, SEC dedicates itself to amplifying the values of students. I want to help ensure the voices of all students continue to be heard in order to promote excellence within the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 8": "I was rejected from the Computer Science program at my first-choice university. It was a difficult experience as I put a lot of effort into my application, which caused detrimental effects to my self-worth. At first, it was difficult to get involved at A&M out of fear of another rejection. Nevertheless, I chose to push myself out of my comfort zone by joining a Freshman Leadership Organization, which developed my interpersonal skills and allowed me to make impactful connections that aided in restoring my sense of confidence. Finally, the culmination of all my hard work paid off as I was accepted into the Computer Science program at A&M. Despite the unfortunate circumstances, I was able to maintain focus on my goals and grow from what I initially regarded as a failure. As a result, I no longer let the fear of being rejected hinder my success. I now strive to become more involved by mentoring incoming STEM students, expanding my network at professional events such as career fairs, and applying for SEC where I hope to contribute to its mission of serving the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 9": "In high school, I worked as a kennel technician at a veterinary clinic during the height of the pandemic. The clinic was short-staffed and the work environment was chaotic, as vet technicians were scrambling to accommodate the influx of patients. As a result of this, I took on more responsibilities to help the clinic\u2019s success, such as learning how to draw blood and give vaccinations. Performing these additional tasks was what I ended up enjoying most about working at the clinic. Each day was unpredictable, but this environment allowed me to thrive and brought me closer to my coworkers. A shared sense of struggle in our team allowed us to work better as a whole. I learned that strong relationships within a team help everyone collaborate effectively and constantly remind individuals of the team\u2019s final objective. Because of this, I now strive to meet people who understand the value of teamwork in order to be enveloped in environments that are passionate and invigorating, similar to what I experienced at the clinic."

I have had the opportunity to attend DI Saturday and Industry night last semester, both of which were organized by SEC, and from experience I can confidently say they opened my eyes to the real world engineering industry and have motivated me to pursue research for companies focused in civil engineering. I believe that by creating awareness of all the opportunities and careers that stem from engineering, students will have more clarity in making their choices in regards to their careers that come ahead of them. Additionally, the chances to network with people that work in the engineering fields is crucial in students' preparation towards their future success.",
            "Question 8": "Junior year I challenged myself to take AP Studio Art while also taking on school, dance team, and college applications: which quickly became an overload of commitments. The curriculum for art required me to create a piece each week, something that I found to be difficult since I created detailed and realistic artwork. I was unable to gather enough work for the AP exam, resulting in my decision to take the course again my senior year. Although I was disappointed in myself, I stepped back to reevaluate how I went wrong and kept a positive mindset to ensure success in the end. Setting a set time in the day to work on my pieces made it easier to finish the weekly deadlines. After finding out I received a perfect score on my exam, not only was I proud of the art I created but I also came out learning new strategies to use in the future to get things done in a timely manner. The main strategy that I'd like to highlight is to only commit to things that I will have enough time and dedication to pour into.",
            "Question 9": "I was involved in drill team throughout high school, and was a dance officer my senior year. Having that leadership role came with many responsibilities and challenges, but having four more dance officers to share and overcome certain tasks with; made the work enjoyable. Working in a group to clean dance routines, plan out team practices, and lead performances was fun because we all had close friendships with each other. Officers had an extra class before the team joined us, and walking into the gym to see them and our directors was a part of my day that I always looked forward to. Although the responsibilities that we had were sometimes overwhelming, we knew we had one another to ask for advice on anything that we may have been struggling with, whether it was dance related or not. For this reason I believe maintaining a good environment that establishes close and trusting relationships is crucial in communicating with each other to complete our tasks. The opportunity to serve my school by promoting the school spirit was an incredibly rewarding experience and I hope to continue making a similar impact on others in my future career."

I believe that for any institution to reach its full potential, it needs the input of the people within it. This applies to the Texas A&M College of Engineering- if it is to be as successful as possible, its student body needs to have a voice. This is especially true when one considers that with the increased rigor that comes with being an engineering student, there will also be more needs, since many students studying engineering will never have seen a challenge as difficult as the one posed by their engineering coursework. Students will need resources for studying, as well as resources for maintaining mental and physical health, and the presence of an organization built of students who relate to those needs will facilitate the process of fulfilling them.",
            "Question 8": "When I was in eighth grade, I tried out for a spot on my school\u2019s soccer team. I made it a long way, but unfortunately, I was eliminated in the final round of cuts. While I initially thought to blame my failure on the poor judgment of the coaches, who had limited knowledge of soccer, I was eventually hit with the harsh reality that the only person I could blame was myself. The players who made the team were all amazing, with all of them either having significant natural talent, work ethic, or a combination of the two. On the contrary, I was someone cursed with a small physique, no natural athleticism, and I never practiced on my own. However, instead of resenting the players who had everything that I did not, I decided to follow in their footsteps. I began to train more and moved up to a more competitive club. For months, I worked extremely hard and was able to make my high school\u2019s soccer team, which had been my goal from the beginning. Through this experience, I realized the value of self-awareness and hard work, and I continue to apply both to my daily practices.",
            "Question 9": "The most enjoyable work I have done was my summer internship last year with UTHealth. I worked with a group that was studying a genetic disorder known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and my job allowed me to shadow doctors and listen in on rounds, where the doctors would talk about patients before visiting them. I enjoyed this job because I was constantly learning new things about the medical field. Of course I learned more about TSC, but I also learned about many other fascinating conditions that I never would have thought existed. For example, there is a genetic disorder commonly known as Maple Syrup Urine Disease, which makes urine smell like maple syrup, which is possibly somewhat gross, but undeniably interesting! I also learned about medical ethics when doctors wanted to force parents to have their infant undergo life-saving hormone replacement therapy, and the parents declined, which resulted in the ethics committee being called in. I also got to see many kinds of patients while shadowing doctors, who were amazing to see in action. This experience was so impactful to me that it changed my career goal from doing cancer research to becoming a medical geneticist."

Throughout my public school education, it was difficult to grasp the broad scope of the different engineering disciplines. As a freshman, I began to understand the greater impact of engineering through exposure in engineering classes. I learned how broad engineering is with various careers and how rewarding it feels to be part of a bigger change in our world.\nThrough events hosted by the SEC such as the EnVision Conference and E-Week, students as young as elementary school age can see what an engineer does. From problem-solving to innovating, engineering inspires those to seek greater discipline, an open mind, and a passion for innovation. I think it\u2019s important to get this information out to young students as they make decisions about their college career.",
            "Question 8": "My first memorable experience learning from failure was in the 7th grade and involves my math class. I was one of the few kids whose teacher had recommended to skip 7th grade math and start Algebra 1. In the first days of the Algebra class I continually found myself becoming more confused and low homework grades made it clear that I didn\u2019t have the background to continue on. Within the first two weeks of school, my mom had emailed the school and asked that I transfer into the regular math class. I cried to my mom about the embarrassment I felt having to leave the \u201csmart kid\u201d math class.\nLooking back now, I understand how crucial it was for me to transfer out of Algebra 1 and build the foundation necessary so I could be successful in my future math courses. Now that I am well into my college career, I still work to recognize my limits. My first semester at A&M I started in Math 150 after failing the Math Placement Exam. This failure did not upset me because I knew that Math 150 would give me the foundation to succeed.",
            "Question 9": "After attending summer camp for 12 years, I was given the opportunity to work as a counselor and experience camp as an employee tasked with caring for and mentoring young campers. While technically it was a job, it never felt that way to me. I was compensated in more ways than one for my hard work. I was able to see the way I could mentor my campers to make new friends, take risks, learn to swim, climb that extra 20 feet to ring the bell, and so much more. Watching these young girls absorb all that they experienced and knowing that they took home skills that they could translate and build upon in everyday life was rewarding for me in this new role.\nNot only did my campers learn from me but I was able to learn from them. As a first-year counselor, I was able to bolster my leadership abilities, see new perspectives, and serve as a role model for my campers. Seeing the way I could inspire my campers to love camp and love themselves made my job fun."

            "Question 8": "Failure is not fulfilling your expectations, and after my first semester of college, I deemed myself a failure. I folded into the mold my older sisters and brothers made for me, and took their advice to heart for college. I joined the organizations they told me about and was everything that a college student should be, according to them; I quickly felt out of place.\nI wasn\u2019t happy and couldn\u2019t bring myself to put effort into organizations I wasn\u2019t truly passionate about, so I withdrew from these clubs to give my spot to someone else that would cherish the opportunity.\nDuring this transition period, I was able to focus on what I enjoyed without the pressure of others. I found my personality and learned to be comfortable with myself, regardless of outside influences. I saw that this \u201cfailure\u201d of mine was simply me reframing my expectations of myself.

            "Question 8": "In 2020, as president of A Kid Again Club, I envisioned an amazing, virtual experience for the A Kid Again Indiana families, who each have a child suffering from a serious illness. I spearheaded this effort, partnering with my high school\u2019s e-sports team to build and stream a fun Minecraft server for families to join from their homes. Everything was set up: the server was built, the stream was ready, and the families had been alerted. A week before the event, everything collapsed. The server crashed, and by the time we got it working, the student who agreed to stream the event canceled. We were able to hold the event eventually, only for technical difficulties and incompatibilities to thwart it again. The months I invested into this event seemed to be wasted. Although I was disappointed and discouraged at the time, I learned key elements to planning an event, troubleshooting technology, asking and receiving help, and owning up to my mistakes. Improvement requires failure. If there were no failures and problems in the world, there would be nothing for engineers to solve. Today, I have more patience and grace for mistakes, but also a more analytical perspective toward solving problems.",
            "Question 9": "For the past year or so, I have been working on obtaining my private pilot\u2019s license. This process includes an online ground course, a written test, flying lessons with an instructor, solo flying practice time, and a culminating flying skills examination. When I began the process, I was nervous. However, I found that learning about the aspects of planes and flying is something I am truly passionate about. In those beginning days, I told everyone about all the new things I was learning, because how could anyone not be interested in how a plane flies? When I got into the air, it was extraordinary. I was shocked that I was really flying a plane; I remember thinking it was easier than I was expecting. I enjoy flying because I know it is a skill that will be helpful for my future and that I can improve upon. Each structured command and procedure was a new move in a complicated dance I was trying to perfect. I found joy in the purpose that flying gave me and hope to find that kind of passion in all aspects of my life."

            "Question 8": "Last summer I was a software development intern at Citigroup. Before I was cleared to start working on my actual summer project, my manager wanted me to complete a practice assignment. I needed to send data through an HTTP Post API call and then retrieve that data through an HTTP Get API call. I spent about 2 hours trying various solutions to get this to work. When I had a meeting with my manager later that day he determined that the only issue was my failure to switch the input type from \u2018text\u2019 to \u2018JSON\u2019 in the testing tool. Through this failure, I learned that it\u2019s okay to ask questions. If I had utilized the resources I had been provided with, I would have been able to reduce the time and frustration I had over what turned out to be a very simple issue. I grew from this experience by asking clarifying and troubleshooting questions for my main summer project.

However, even as I groaned at their shocking lack of basic skills, I couldn\u2019t help but smile at the scene around me. Music was blaring, people were dancing, and snacks were consumed in ridiculous quantities. All while posters were painted, cookies were baked, and sweatshirts were sorted. It was chaos. But it was productive chaos. The donation booth ended up raising over $500 to build a water well for a village in need. Service has always been a passion of mine and I particularly enjoyed this work because my position allowed me to exercise creative control while collaboratively working with our team to make these ideas successfully come to fruition."

They taught me to show gratitude for my fortunate lifestyle by giving back to the community, as they have done for me. I loved seeing families come together and create memories that\u2019ll last a lifetime. I enjoy preparing community events, like the Easter Egg Hunt, because a simple act of service can quickly make a difference, even if it\u2019s just making someone\u2019s day."

            "Question 7": "As a passionate engineering student at Texas A&M, the SEC's mission to be the representative voice for all engineering students is very important to me. Engineering students, like all people, deserve a strong and active voice to represent them, and the SEC is perfectly suited to fulfill this role. Engineering students are often under a great deal of stress and feel unsupported in their struggles, leading to dissatisfaction with the school that neither the school nor they themselves want. The SEC\u2019s ability to address this through means such as conducting surveys and actively advocating for the needs and concerns of engineering students is unparalleled. As someone who can relate to these struggles and strongly empathize with other engineers, I would be honored to be a member of the SEC and to be a voice for engineering students, especially at such a large university where representation can often feel lacking.",
            "Question 8": "During my time in the school band's drumline, I always wanted to become the captain, and each year a new captain was chosen after tryouts. After moving up from the pit to the drumline itself, I had a chance at getting the position if I tried out, so I did. Despite feeling confident in my skills, I was disappointed to learn that I was not chosen for the position. Upon reflection, I realized that I had become complacent and relied too heavily on my natural talent instead of putting in more effort through practice. This \u201cfailure\" ended up being a valuable turning point in my life. I realized that success requires more than just natural talent and a passion for something, it also requires dedication and a purposeful effort. I am able to actively apply these same principles to my engineering projects which has led me to value my work more and perform better. This experience of failure and growth has shaped me into a more driven and determined person. I am grateful for the lessons I learned along the way, and I am excited about how I can continue to grow as a leader by joining the SEC.",
            "Question 9": "I worked as a store attendant at Target and one of the most enjoyable tasks I had was restructuring the workflow and storage for restocking check lanes and spill-stations. The previous storage was disorganized and located far from the check lanes, causing employees to neglect the task, especially on busy days. With new management, I was given the opportunity to reorganize the storage and create a more efficient workflow. I chose a new, larger closet, organized it for efficiency, and created a printed checklist, simplifying the job. The closet was well-stocked with necessary supplies and located near the check lanes.\nThroughout this experience my superiors valued my opinions and ideas, making me feel appreciated and grateful to be contributing to a positive work environment. I was able to use my creativity to solve a problem and improve the workflow. Finally, I was able to explain my thought processes and show the tangible results of my work to my superiors. This experience was very rewarding and I was proud of the positive impact I made on our store and team. I learned the importance of organization and communication in the workplace, and the satisfaction that comes from improving a workplace."

This helps to create a motivated and competitive engineering community, where students can excel in their field. The presence of a talented and innovative generation of engineers is essential for society. Events like Career Fairs and Industrial Nights provide students with valuable opportunities to plan their career, interact with industry professionals, and prepare to shape the future of Texas. My experience at the career fair last fall taught me the importance of being well-prepared and confident, so I was able to engage with over 30 companies, distribute 15 resumes, and receive multiple interview offers. I am grateful for the growth opportunities provided by the SEC, and I aspire to become a part of it to contribute to the Aggie engineering community.",
            "Question 8": "Four years ago, I made a big move from China to Texas; the change was beyond my imagination. For a long time, I was struggling with fitting in the new environment. The second year, I decided to take 5 college courses to challenge myself, but I went through a tough period \u2013 the unexpected pandemic, financial hardship, my lack of proficiency in English messed up my life. For the US history textbook, I had to check the dictionary over 10 times for every paragraph. After the first month, I nearly gave up, missing most of my homework.\nThe night I knew I would fail multiple courses was devastating. After a lengthy mental struggle, I was determined to turn it around. I spent the entire weekend catching up on my lectures and homework, submitting them months after deadlines, despite many emails from my professors saying that it would not help, but I just wanted to prove it to myself that I can. When I finally finished them, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, realizing that I have the potential to achieve anything I set my mind to \u2013 it rebuilt my confidence. Since then, I never received grades lower than A.",
            "Question 9": "When the pandemic hit, I wanted to contribute to my community by creating videos to educate people about COVID-19 and its proper management. Hence, I joined my high school's broadcast program to learn about camera operation and video editing. Along the way, I discovered my passion for film, graphic design, and photography, becoming the most active member of the club. I spent countless hours in the studio, mastering digital media and creating content for the school. My natural talent and rapid improvement amazed everyone, and I managed to become the vice president. I continued to hone my skills through online resources, earning multiple state-level awards in film and photography and becoming Adobe Certified in both Visual and Video Design. More importantly, I enjoy using my abilities to help others, such as leading the club to create PSAs for local animal shelters and recruitment videos for other clubs, and volunteering to record lectures for a local church during lockdown. Last summer, I was one of 15 finalists in the Adobe Certified Professional National Championship, where I designed posters for a NGO providing children with controllable artificial limbs. It was an enriching and unforgettable experience."

            "Question 7": "The first pillar, in which the SEC strives to be the representative voice of all engineering students, means the most to me. Due to the intensity of engineering courses and high pressure, engineering students are at a high risk of poor mental health, with many experiencing high rates of burnout and depression. Accordingly, this pillar is important to me because I believe that it is crucial for the SEC to voice the difficulties faced by engineering students to school officials, in hopes that drop out, depression, burnout, and even suicide rates can be lowered and students can enjoy their area of study more. In addition to voicing difficulties, a representative voice helps students voice their ideas, opinions, and suggestions for the engineering department. Accordingly, this pillar is meaningful to me because it empowers students to play a role in their education and feel more connected to their departments.",
            "Question 8": "After having been a competitive swimmer for 10 years, I wanted to end my final season on a good note. Regardless of all my work, I failed. I swam worse than I had all season. I felt frustrated and hopeless, like my hard work had been for nothing. But, I was determined to do better and end my club season with a best time. So, despite my discouragement, I worked twice as hard. This time, my hard work paid off, and I crushed my previous personal best time.\nMy initial failure forced me to recognize the importance of never giving up. If I had given up after my high school meet, I never would have swam a best time. Accordingly, I learned a lot about resilience from my failure. I realized that setbacks are a part of life, and without learning how to persevere, we won\u2019t be pushed to true potential. Furthermore, my failure helped me to become a better leader because it taught me to focus on resilience instead of disappointment in the face of failure and encourage others to do the same, as well as showed me how to adapt to challenges instead of giving up.",
            "Question 9": "I noticed that many students at my high school took our custodial staff for granted, so I decided to do something to help show our gratitude for their hard work. Accordingly, I came up with the idea for an appreciation luncheon, complete with a meal, dessert, and hand-written thank you notes from the senior class. A lot of work went into coordinating the event with administration, students, and vendors, but it was all work that I enjoyed because I knew how much it would mean to the staff. Furthermore, getting to watch my idea turn into action was really meaningful to me. I had a goal and a plan, but I wasn\u2019t sure my idea would actually happen. Once I put my plan into action and began gaining support from administration, I grew to love the work even more because I knew that I was actually going to be able to execute my idea and make a difference for the staff. Finally, seeing the impact that this small gesture had on them made every second of the work worth it. Directly seeing the fruits of my labor made me passionate about continuing to serve others in ways like this."

            "Question 7": "Increasing engineering awareness through programs and events throughout the community is something with which I share enthusiasm. One way I can articulate this enthusiasm is through programs like the EnVision Conference. As early as 5th grade, my interest in engineering began to form. I became fascinated with everyday technology and how they were able to work. In 6th grade, I had the opportunity to take a relatively new course called \u201cGateway to Technology\u201d as my elective. This elective laid the foundation for my passion for engineering and helped transform my interest into something more concrete ultimately leading me to where I am today. Through the EnVision Conference, allowing K-12 students to explore their passions and introduce them to the realm of engineering would be a way for me to express my gratitude for the opportunities I was given throughout my education, helping me richly develop my love for engineering.",
            "Question 8": "Beginning my first semester of college, acclimation to the new environment was a real challenge for me. As the semester started rolling, I was able to meet new people/make new friends, and I began prioritizing the social aspect of college while assuming my education would be fine. As a result, I ended my first semester at Texas A&M with a poor GPA. Through this undermining experience, I was able to reflect on how I had taken my education for granted and failed to make a big enough commitment to achieve my personal/professional goals. Learning from my mistake, I went into my second semester motivated to turn my academics around. Throughout the semester, I adopted a more proactive approach to my education and as a result, substantially improved my GPA. I created a flexible but disciplined schedule allowing me to find a balance between my personal life and my studies while also dedicating time to the development of my personal goals/ambitions. Although early, this experience has become a turning point in my journey through college and has motivated me towards working harder to pursue my dreams and become the best version of myself.",
            "Question 9": "After working two summers as a lifeguard, I was thrilled at the opportunity last summer to take on the role of Head Lifeguard. This role meant new tasks like overseeing all lifeguards, ensuring proper pool maintenance, leading in emergency response situations, and 40+ hour weeks a majority of the summer. Even with the additional responsibilities, it was a rewarding experience that I enjoyed wholeheartedly. I was able to deepen my connections with families and foster additional meaningful relationships within the community. Being Head Lifeguard also gave me the ability to boost my leadership skills as they were constantly put to the test day-to-day. I found happiness in seeing my team succeed and successfully carry out their lifeguarding duties to the best of their abilities. Seeing the trust other lifeguards put in me to handle scenarios like administering proper safety protocols in appropriate situations and managing uncooperative guests inspired me to not only be the best lifeguard I could be but also to set a good example for my coworkers. As a result, this experience is one I will never forget as it helped me build deep relationships with others, feel a greater sense of community, and develop my leadership skills."

Coming into this semester, I along with others I know, felt not truly prepared for professional life after college. One reason I feel that this area is so important is because a great curriculum and degree can only do so much for you, but learning the skills and gaining the experience required for the workforce are so much more important and often make the difference in a hire. I learned this first hand in this year's internship application season. After completing the SEC internship the previous summer, at the career fair, I noticed the huge difference having experience made. It gave me not only something to talk about, but also something recruiters were interested in. This pillar means the most to me because I have first hand experience on the positive impact SEC makes in this area.",
            "Question 8": "Every Christmas, my high school hosted a huge \u201cLetters to Santa\u201d fundraiser through Macys. It\u2019s this big event where everyone writes Santa letters and for every letter, $2 is donated to the Make a Wish foundation. The previous year set a record of 70,000 letters written and $140,000 donated. However, this year was covid year and letters were submitted online through a google form. Despite having minimal programming experience, a friend and I set out to create a bot that would automatically submit letters to the form. After hours of writing code, we decided to test it out. It worked. The code submitted 300 letters a second, but I made a fatal error. The form filled up reaching its 50,000 submission capacity and every \u201cletter\u201d was written with the word \u201ctest\u201d instead of the 2 sentence minimum. Not only had I filled the form with worthless letters, but also prevented anyone else from submitting them. From this experience, I learned to slow down and thoroughly think things through. If I wasn\u2019t in such a rush to try out the new thing I created, all of this could\u2019ve been avoided and the project may have been a success.",
            "Question 9": "Everyday for an entire summer I got the experience to hear different people from different backgrounds tell the story of their lives. Last summer, I worked at a brewery. During this time, I was serving food and pouring drinks all on minimum wage. Like the food industry often is, it was absolute chaos when it was busy. However, the down times were when I gained the most value out of my entire experience. Like clockwork everyday around 2 pm, one or two seniors would sit down at the bar for an afternoon drink. These people weren\u2019t just looking to get a drink. They wanted a conversation. Additionally, being the youngest person working, meant they were always eager to talk to me specifically. And what I heard fascinated me. They would spew stories about first loves, their families, or how they climbed the corporate ladder. And always end everything with a piece of advice. Listening as someone, recalled and reflected on the legacies of their past, gave me a new perspective on life. As a result, I became a better listener and more open-minded. The summer gave me the invaluable skill of being able to strike up a conversation with anyone."

Because of this pillar, I see SEC as a supportive guide that prepares A&M Engineering students for the real world, providing them opportunities such as SEC Directed Internship to expand beyond the classroom and directly apply the skills they have learned to the field. I believe this pillar also helps develop a sense of independence in A&M Engineering students because students are encouraged to prepare for and attend events such as the Career Fair, where they must interact with strangers, constantly adapt to different situations, and reach out to companies on their own. By investing time in advising A&M Engineering students about the fundamentals of professionalism and giving them opportunities to exercise those skills, SEC equips them with the means to be successful both in their career and in everyday life.",
            "Question 8": "I started playing tennis when I was four years old and as a little kid, I was told that I have to play to win. To me, my failure was every loss I faced on the court. Tennis has been a part of me my whole life, but in high school, I started to love and appreciate tennis. Being a part of my high school tennis team taught me that my matches were about more than winning or losing. They were a direct reflection of who I was and how I treat people, whether I am winning or losing. And no matter how I did, my teammates were always there to support me.\nFacing hard losses taught me the importance of having morals to stand by, even when you\u2019re losing. Despite the pain that comes with losing, I have learned to value my friendships, my principles, and the journey along the way more than winning. And the more I realized this, the more I found I had the strength and endurance to continue, even when life gets a little too hard.",
            "Question 9": "In high school, I was an officer for a club that was meant to introduce high school girls to the different areas of work in a predominantly male field. The most exciting opportunity we had was hearing from Sophia Garcia, one of the few female flight instructors in El Salvador. In preparation, we frequently spoke with her about scheduling, collaborated with the Social Chairs to make flyers and social media posts, reviewed the presentation slides, and helped decorate the room she was presenting in. It was stressful at times, but finally hearing her speak about the obstacles she faced in her life and her career and how she overcame them, and listening to her encourage and truly inspire the girls that attended was incredibly rewarding. She inspired me with how determined she was to share her story and her belief that if you really want it, you have to work for it, no matter what challenges you may face. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and compromising when faced with conflict and different ideas."

I understand that feeling of lostness. I am determined to help others find themselves and their role here.",
            "Question 8": "During this past summer, I learned I had an overall limit. I was ambitious with working a high-profile internship, tutoring in math, and taking summer classes. It was not long before I realized that I would not be able to work to my full potential in all three areas. I assessed my situation and prioritized my responsibilities. After careful consideration, I dropped my summer classes because I had important commitments to people. I could not place them below myself.\nI learned that multitasking is merely an illusion; in reality, people get less done multitasking than focusing on a single task. I learned that the \u201chard way.\u201d Still, it was a valuable lesson to learn: it reminded me of my humanity and our proneness of mistakes. Most importantly, my mistake taught me that there is more to life than school and work; there is a perfect medium of work and leisure, and we need only to find it.",
            "Question 9": "I enjoy working when it takes me back to my roots. I began as an \u201capprentice\u201d under my father in the construction industry.

At the time, I did not enjoy it; it took time from playing soccer and video games. But, at a young age, he emphasized the value of hard work and the amount of sweat that goes into earning a dollar. Those two lessons became engrained in my brain; they are something I will never forget.\nThis past summer, I interned at the Port of Corpus Christi Authority. I was quickly suited in PPE and surveyed a sinking dock. I cannot recall a day I sweat more. (The Corpus Christi summer is very unforgiving). But, I thoroughly enjoyed doing something new and working with my hands. That is the work I enjoy the most: doing something new that challenges me mentally and physically."

Chemistry came naturally to me in high school, so I had high expectations at the collegiate level. I had prepared for weeks and was confident I would ace this exam. Unfortunately, I did the opposite precisely. I failed! This shocked me, and I could see my hopes of an A in the course slipping away. However, rather than accepting defeat, I went to work. I sought out tutoring and class resources. I made friends and study groups to support myself and my classmates. I applied these tactics to my other courses and devoted all my energy to achieving my goal of an A. It would come down to the final exam. I nervously checked my grade and saw that I had fully recovered, making the exact grade I needed for a final grade of an A. Perhaps hard work or maybe help from a penny on Sully?

            "Question 8": "In my sophomore year of high school, I participated in an engineering team competition for the National Beta Club. Each team member was tasked with creating a separate step for a Rube Goldberg machine. My task was the starter and failed in competition, meaning that the rest of my teammates were not even able to see their hard work come to fruition. While I felt a great amount of guilt and remorse, my team members made sure to console me and remind me that, as a team competition, it was not all my fault. As a very competitive person, I have always hated to lose but this experience showed me that there are more important things in life than just winning. For me, being at fault for the machine was a very hard experience but having the consolation and support of my teammates, who I had jeopardized, meant so much to me. I was able to see that in any group environment, the final outcome is a result of the whole group, not just one person, whether bad or good. It helped me grow as a person and be more understanding and supportive in a team situation.",
            "Question 9": "For a NASA high school program, I worked on a team to design a lunar hopper that had necessary capabilities to land and function on the moon as well as transfer these features to do the same on Mars. This was an enjoyable experience because I was working on a project that I had genuine interest in and was with people that shared this interest. While it took a great amount of time and effort to actually complete the design and present it, I was able to find joy in the work I was doing with my team. Completing each step brought a feeling of accomplishment in knowing that we were doing meaningful work. I enjoyed each moment getting to know my team and being able to work with them towards a collective goal. When we finally finished the project and presentation, an overwhelming sense of achievement and reward came over me. It was even more rewarding, after the fact, to know that the hard work and dedication had finally come to fruition in the form of a final, successful project."

            "Question 7": "I believe professional advancement is the most important pillar. Engineering has rigorous classes, and on top of that, transitioning into the professional world can be stressful. Internships and co-ops improve the chances of landing a good full-time job by teaching engineers technical skills necessary for various industries. Full-time jobs are vital for people\u2019s financial future, such as starting a family or buying a house. I\u2019ve benefited from career fairs and welcome socials as I\u2019ve learned what traits and skills companies are seeking in an engineer and the functions of various positions (i.e process or manufacturing engineering). The knowledge I\u2019ve obtained from professional development events have helped me land interviews for internships and co-ops. Having plenty of resources for professional development helps ensure a successful future for people, which is why I would like to help prepare future career fairs so people can have similar experiences to mine.",
            "Question 8": "While taking organic chemistry 1, I procrastinated on the homework and studying for exams. I also didn\u2019t study in an efficient manner as I would just skim the notes multiple times, thus my first two exams were very poor grades and I was considering dropping the class. I realized my poor grade would put my chances of getting into any engineering major through ETAM in jeopardy. I began studying for exams in advance by working out practice problems and asking questions during office hours and review sessions, writing down the topics I struggled to memorize or understand, watching review videos on the internet to make sure I understood important concepts, and redrawing reaction mechanisms until I memorized them. From my newfound effort, I discovered that for many classes I was a hybrid of a visual and auditory learner. As a result, I did extremely well on the 3rd and 4th exam and ended up bringing up my C to an A in the class. Outside the course, I began using the same study habits and methods for other classes which helped me tremendously for obtaining A\u2019s in courses like organic chemistry 2 and material balances",
            "Question 9": "In high school I was a private/assistant badminton coach. I helped junior players (ages 5-16) improve their technique and strategy to prepare them for regional and national tournaments. I really enjoyed the job as I had no prior coaching experience, so I had to develop my organizational, analytical, and problem-solving skills in order to help design lesson plans tailored to my students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. However, because my students were different ages, I used different approaches, such as more basic analogies for little kids, and more detailed explanations for older kids. I was able to build a meaningful relationship with my coach as he was my mentor and he taught me valuable life lessons, such as dealing with criticism from other people, how to remain patient, and how to effectively give feedback without being rude or disrespectful. Alongside the relationship with my coach, I became friends with most of my students and it\u2019s extremely rewarding to see them become top players in Texas in their respective age division as it shows both their efforts and mine have paid off."

            "Question 7": "The pillar from the SEC Mission Statement that resonates the most with me is working to increase engineering awareness. This is because I got interested in engineering at a very young age because of the many good mentors throughout my education. The mentors on my robotics team, especially, really made a big impact on me and taught me many useful skills. And so I would love to pay it forward and have a part in helping people take their first steps into the engineering world. I was already able to get started at a coding summer camp with the organization Hello World, where I was able to further establish my own knowledge by helping beginner coders who were having trouble. However, I feel like being a part of SEC will give me many more opportunities to reach out to the younger generations and get them interested in the engineering world.",
            "Question 8": "In middle school, I learned how to play the cello and really enjoyed the environment I was in, however, it was upsetting to find out there was no orchestra program at my highschool. Because of this, I searched for another activity to keep me busy and decided I would try out for the tennis team. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make the tennis team, which had me at a loss on what I was going to do, until out of nowhere my orchestra director emailed me, saying that a new orchestra program was opening at the highschool. This made me ecstatic and was a sign that I had to stick with orchestra. Reminiscing, I'm almost glad I didn't make the tennis team, since if I had, there would be no way I would have time for orchestra as well, and so I wouldn't have made some of my bestest friends and done something I truly enjoyed. Because of this experience, I learned that no matter if things don't go your way, there will always be a plan, which helped me grow into a much less anxious person who looks back at mistakes, not with regret, but something to learn from.",
            "Question 9": "When the COVID lockdowns started, I was stuck at home bored out of my mind until I stumbled across a fascinating project that was recreating the entirety of New York City in a one block to one meter scale. Previously, I had already started building a city of my own in Minecraft after I became passionate about city planning and architecture. However, my progress was very slow since I was the only one working on it, and I was losing motivation. So when I found the NYC project, I was very excited to start because a huge amount of people all came together to build. I really enjoyed teaching new players how to navigate the server and the staff team of the project noticed, so they invited me to join the staff team, and I jumped at the opportunity. The project taught me several important skills needed in engineering such as teamwork, by learning how to interact with a diverse group of people, and leadership. I also acquired a new confidence that allows me to find ways to overcome obstacles in my path and understand how important it is to take advantage of opportunities when they come my way."

The committee is extraordinarily persistent with their reminders to fill out the annual survey and diligent to act on the information returned. This intentionality encourages diversity of thought and opinion, the ingredients necessary for an enriching classroom experience. A diverse classroom excites me to not only learn from professors, but also from my peers. I have experienced the benefits of diversity first-hand as I strive to surround myself with people who think differently than me and so will push me to better understand my own convictions. I aspire to be a part of a group like SEC that puts influence back into the hands of the students it serves.",
            "Question 8": "My first summer at camp, I was a \u201ccounselor in training.\u201d I was assigned every task the \u201creal\u201d counselors didn\u2019t want to do. I woke up at 5:30 most mornings to cook for the campers, cleaned bathrooms between meals, and deep-cleaned camp storage closets until late every night. I arrived on Sunday, and by Thursday night I wanted to quit. I woke up crying from a nightmare in which my mentor found me in bed, gave me a stack of plates and a bucket of hot water, and told me to start washing. Needless to say, no one needed me to wash dishes from my top bunk, but I had let long days steal my optimism. I began to cut corners and wanted to leave camp! Eventually, my mentor explained to me that I was being given hard tasks because the camp was understaffed, and none of the counselors in charge of campers could do my job while giving their wards proper care. After realizing that my hard work was necessary, I was able to reorient my view of the challenge. I worked at camp for another 10 weeks; those weeks became some of my life's happiest and most formative. I have grown to recognize and appreciate the value of selfless work behind the scenes to accomplish shared goals.",
            "Question 9": "I work in a Biomaterials Research Lab and every Friday am scheduled for five hours. This shift\u2019s length was daunting at first; however, Fridays have become my favorite day of the week. Long shifts allow for a deeper dive into the \u201cwhy\u201d of my assigned work. Understanding the science behind my work has caused me to recognize overlap between what I\u2019m learning for work and class. At work today I was doing a test to ensure osteoblasts can fit through our bone scaffolds, in class last week I learned what an osteoblast is and its role in bone formation. Few things rival the excitement I feel when I realize my job is making me a more educated student. Long shifts also offer opportunities for bonding with my labmates. On Fridays, I have time to encourage and learn from my very cool coworkers. My labmates have proven to be some of the funniest, most down-to-earth people I\u2019ve met. Friday shifts foster friendships as we work together to achieve change. I love my work because I know I am furthering medicine, encouraging my brilliant peers and mentors, am being pushed to my potential and forged into a better woman."

            "Question 7": "The pillar of representation means the most to me. Having a diverse range of perspectives and experiences in the workplace leads to more innovative and creative solutions to problems because people from different backgrounds bring unique perspectives and ideas to the table. Representation helps to address the issue of underrepresentation in STEM fields and can lead to a more equitable distribution of opportunities. This is particularly important for communities who have historically faced barriers to entering the field. Having a more representative engineering workforce also promotes a culture of inclusiveness and respect, creating a welcoming environment for everyone. This is important for creating a positive work environment, where everyone feels valued and appreciated. Increasing representation of minorities in engineering can help address the issue of underrepresentation of certain communities in STEM fields. This can lead to more equitable distribution of opportunities and a reduction in barriers that prevent certain groups from pursuing careers in engineering. Having a more representative engineering workforce can serve as a source of inspiration for underrepresented communities, encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM fields.",
            "Question 8": "I remember the feeling of utter disappointment when I completely missed the goal whilst taking the final penalty in the soccer district-final for my high-school. I had let my team down, and it seemed like all my hard work and dedication had gone to waste. In that moment, I felt like quitting, but I knew that was futile. I needed to overcome it. The first step in bouncing back was to accept responsibility for my failure. I acknowledged my mistake, and that I needed to work harder to improve the shortcomings in my game. I took time to reflect on what went wrong, and I made a plan to address those issues in the future. Next, I sought the support of my teammates and coach. They reassured me that failures are a natural part of the game. It reminded me that the key thing was how I responded to this setback, and only pushed me harder. Finally, I got back to work, practicing hard and focusing on improving my game. After my hard work and determination, I finally got my chance to prove myself again. I helped win the district-final the next year and even go far in Nationals. I learned that failure is a part of life, and it is up to us to determine how we respond to it. By bouncing back, I could not only improve my game, but I could also inspire others to do the same. For me, that was the greatest lesson of all.",
            "Question 9": "I recently completed an internship at PNC and, it was a fantastic experience. From day one, I felt a part of the team and was given meaningful work that allowed me to contribute to the company's goals. The people I worked with were incredibly supportive and made me feel like I was part of the family. I learned so much about the banking industry and gained valuable skills in project management, teamwork, and communication. The environment at PNC was fast-paced and challenging, but it was also incredibly rewarding. I was given the opportunity to work on several projects that were important to the company, and I was able to see the impact of my work in real-time. I also appreciated the opportunity to attend training sessions and workshops that helped me develop professionally. One of the highlights of my internship was working with a team of colleagues from various departments on a project. We had to collaborate effectively to complete the project on time, and it was a great opportunity to build relationships and learn from each other. Overall, I am so grateful for the opportunity to have worked at PNC. I had an amazing time, and I am confident that the skills I have learned will serve me well in my future career."

Engineering is difficult to understand because, on top of the countless career paths, it is also a mindset that can be applied to any problem. This is why increasing engineering awareness through the SEC\u2019s programs and events is the pillar that means the most to me. I entered college as an engineering major unsure of what my passions were. However, my interest in engineering developed after attending SEC events like Industry Night and career fair. Talking to people in the industry helped reveal how applicable an engineering mindset is, and SEC has helped push me to pursue greater goals by exposing me to the opportunities of engineering. Therefore, it is also a goal of mine to help spread engineering awareness",
            "Question 8": "At the age of thirteen, I thought my life was over. I failed to become a famous YouTuber! I had wasted all summer learning to edit videos and photoshop thumbnails so that I could upload video game commentaries. At the time, I was doing this for my dream of fame and fortune. However, I realized my heart was in it for the wrong reasons. After my YouTube defeat, I started to enjoy the filmmaking process. As I got better, I began submitting my work to film competitions and surprisingly saw results at the district and state levels. It became evident that I was more successful when working with patience and passion. If it weren\u2019t for my failed attempt at stardom, I would have never learned the skills and art behind filmmaking. From these videos, I grew to be a more open person. There are times when I forget to enjoy the process of learning or making memories. Like my attempt at fame, focusing solely on the end goal and not the process results in discontent. I\u2019m now working on becoming more self-aware in regard to my personal growth and have applied this mindset to my involvement in organizations and class.",
            "Question 9": "I genuinely enjoyed working through my role as a Fish Camp counselor. As someone who originally wanted to transfer from A&M, this came as a shock. Almost every week during the summer, I would finish work at my part-time job and immediately drive up to wherever my camp was meeting. Fish Camp required me to learn how to act and dance in skits. Moreover, my partner and I prepared gifts and games to play with our discussion group of ten freshmen. This part of camp excited me because I was looking forward to meeting a group of people who would look up to me and eventually become my friends. This ties into my absolute favorite thing about Fish Camp. As a counselor, I was able to advise freshmen about all the things college has to offer. I gave insight into dorm life, student organizations, academics, and more. Not only did I get to see excitement light up their faces when discussing these topics, but I felt a sense of gratification. My academic and social knowledge was actually requested by the freshmen. These aspects of Fish Camp served to create the most fun and fulfilling work experience of my life."

I believe that SEC is in the perfect position to embody these values as well and support our fellow engineers and give them valuable skills and opportunities to be successful in their careers.",
            "Question 8": "During my freshman year, I applied to several different engineering design teams because I wanted to gain practical experience in engineering. I applied to SAE AERO, SAE Electric/Baja, the Sounding Rocketry Team, and AggieSat throughout the semester. For some of them, I heard back and got an interview, while from others I never heard back. In the end I was rejected by all of them. However, I was determined to participate in a design org that fit my interests at some point, and I kept talking to people who participated in these orgs and getting advice on how to be a better candidate for the position. I continuously updated my resume and learned new skills by working in an aerodynamics lab, and this all paid off when I applied to SAE AERO again in the spring and I was accepted. Since then, I have worked hard to contribute to the team and learn the practical skills that I initially set out to learn. However, I also gained valuable skills on the journey to get into the organization in the first place, and in the future I hope to approach my setbacks in the same way: reflecting and improving.",

The four days before camp were organized chaos, as everybody was working hard on different things to plan and prepare. Everything required lots of administration and behind the scenes work, but the work never bothered me because I had a clear end goal and purpose with all of it. I knew that what I was doing was going to have an impact on lots of people, and due to good communication and a well-planned work schedule it was much less tedious work than it could have been. I got to work together with people who I had become good friends with over the summer, and working together only made us closer. Seeing the work pay off at camp, with everything running smoothly and inspiring dozens of incoming freshmen, I felt even more like it had all been worth it."

            "Question 8": "I was a club officer in high school in charge of submitting documents about our club's accomplishments. The deadline in December was suddenly upon me, and the real, horrible feeling of failure sank in when I realized I had completely forgotten to work on them. I rushed to submit them and contemplated the reason for my failure; I realized there was something wrong with how I managed my time. I didn\u2019t know how to handle the responsibility of an important position and didn't plan properly between the clubs and classes I was in. This experience made me realize that taking responsibility comes with genuine communication and taking action to accomplish goals. Now, I communicate effectively and ask questions to ensure I am aware of what is expected of me. I also organize tasks each week, which makes me feel much less overwhelmed and burned out: I have a set number of things to complete and I ensure I am aware of long-term deadlines.

As a first-generation immigrant, it was a challenge coming to a top engineering program without knowledge of how the industry worked, or different professions. But upon learning about what\u2019s offered by SEC to learn about the industry and the professional world, over time the anxiety associated with my professional opportunities post-grad, lessened. I\u2019m a planner so events like DI Saturday and Industry Nights for freshmen I found to be really informative and well-laid-out descriptions of what professions specific majors can lead to. Even SEC Career Fair was an amazing learning opportunity.

            "Question 8": "Particularly in the South Asian Austin community, the pedestal that UT Austin\u2019s (the unspoken place) placed on is far higher than it should be. So, all through school, I was conditioned to believe I loved the idea of being a UT freshman. It motivated me through high school and landed me in the Top 10. Everyone around me was certain I\u2019d be accepted, placing this somewhat false sense of assuredness within myself. And so, whenever decisions were released, I saw I hadn\u2019t received the major of my choice, only school admission, which was probably the largest feeling of failure I\u2019d felt to that point. I\u2019d placed all my worth into that decision and planned my entire future around it. From that grief, I learned that you can only plan so much, but outcomes are different from projections, so adaptability is key. I cannot place my self-worth in something I have little control over, and that I\u2019m much more than my academic ability. It led me to make the decision to attend A&M, which turned out to be the best place for me and I would make the same decision a thousand times over. Horns Down and Gig \u2019em!",
            "Question 9": "As a senior in high school, we were given the opportunity to tour the incoming freshman students around our high school, explain the ins and outs of the school day, and dip their toes in the water before diving headfirst, on the first day of school. We had three days of training and two days of actual tours during the last week of summer break and were there from 7AM to 4PM most days. When the tours began, we were assigned small groups of students to spend the day with, lead them through school spirit assemblies, accurately answer any questions they have, and be good representatives of the school. It was a large time commitment and we spent many hours on our feet, encouraging everyone to participate, which resulted in a great experience of responsibility. As a reoccurring theme through all these answers, I like to be prepared and know what I\u2019m walking into, and I\u2019m sure many of these kids felt the same way. So to be able to be the first impression of high school to them, I hoped to leave them ready to begin this new chapter of life confidently."

            "Question 7": "I think one of the most important tasks the SEC undertakes is increasing engineering awareness, particularly through the EnVision program. SEC\u2019s other pillars are critical in maintaining a healthy environment within the College of Engineering for students. What is special about the mission of increasing engineering awareness is that it has potential to impact the community at large, as well as at Texas A&M.\nAt my elementary school, most of my friends came from poor backgrounds and lacked access to STEM resources. Programs like EnVision can help motivate children who may never have considered engineering to within reach previously.\nThe most important thing we do as engineers is pass down knowledge of our discipline to future generations, as well as encourage others to participate in the field. SEC\u2019s work in promoting engineering to children from varied backgrounds is incredibly important to ensuring a healthy future for engineering.",
            "Question 8": "As a mechanical engineering hopeful, an honors course in discrete mathematics was intimidating, to say the least. I felt completely overwhelmed by the proof writeups. By the end of the first week, it was evident that I was going to struggle, but I stuck with the course, for better or worse.\nFor one of the first times in my life, I had to go far outside my comfort zone to seek help in discrete math. I did the best I could to learn from office hours, friends, and the textbook. At the end, I was excited, albeit nervous, to show how much I learned on the final exam.\nLong story short, I didn\u2019t do well on the final, despite the time and effort I had put into studying for it. I felt crushed. How could I have spent so much time to not perform well?\nI realized what mattered was that I had given discrete math my best. I learned how to be humble and ask for help when I needed it. While I won\u2019t be proving the P vs. NP problem anytime soon, the perseverance I learned from discrete math has been invaluable for my day-to-day trials.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer, I had the opportunity to help facilitate the Texas A&M Philosophy for Children Summer Program. The goal of the program was to introduce middle schoolers to deep philosophical topics in a fun and laidback manner. I was a camper in the program throughout middle school and was thrilled at the opportunity of being able to give back to the camp.\nThroughout the course of the week of camp, I worked at facilitating the discussions, including coming up with ideas for activities that would be fun for the campers. Drawing on my experience as a camper, I knew which topics resonated well with the middle school age group. It was especially fun to introduce the campers to ideas of scarcity and economics by using Swedish Fish. The campers ended up really enjoying the camp, as well as coming out with fresh knowledge on philosophy.\nI enjoyed the camp because it was interesting to hear the camper\u2019s varied perspectives on topics and rewarding to help them reason through arguments. I was thankful to be able to show my appreciation for what the camp had done for me by giving my time over the summer to help."

            "Question 7": "The first pillar of the SEC mission statement, \"it strives to be the representative voice of all engineering students,\" is important to me because it highlights the need for diversity and representation in the field of engineering. As an engineering student, I understand the value of having a variety of voices and perspectives in the field to drive innovation and progress.\nPersonally, I have seen the lack of representation and diversity in the engineering field. When I joined Development in the Society of Automotive Engineers this past year, I was the only girl out of 50 people. This made me realize how important representation and diversity is and I made it my mission to get more girls involved in the organization by becoming an officer. Due to my efforts, we have noticed an increase in the number of girls in the organization, which not only made the group more diverse, but also brought new ideas and perspectives that improved the organization as a whole.\nI'm passionate about promoting diversity and representation in the engineering field, and I believe that the SEC is a great platform to achieve this goal.",
            "Question 8": "One time I failed at something was during my Physics 207 class last semester, as part of the curriculum for Mechanical. I struggled with the class and after poor performances on all 3 exams, I realized that this could negatively affect my GPA if I didn't act swiftly. I was on the verge of Q-dropping the course but didn't because that meant I wouldn't be able to take half the classes on my schedule for the spring.\nAfter seeking help from my advisor, professor, and TA. I was able to recover my grade from a 68 to an 87 by getting a 100 on the final exam that was worth over 35% of my grade. This experience taught me that failure is not the end and that it's important to not give up, but instead learn from my mistakes and seek help when needed. It also helped me to understand that the only way to improve is by learning from my mistakes and working harder. This experience helped my grow as a student and as a person, and it has made me a more determined and resilient individual.",
            "Question 9": "Last summer, I enjoyed working at a restaurant after lifeguarding for the past 3 summers. I wanted to escape the Texas heat and decided to try something new. Working in the service industry was a great experience and I am glad to have had the opportunity to meet people in my community and see families from all sorts of backgrounds. I'm an extrovert and the fast paced environment was perfect for me, it was an amazing opportunity to meet plenty of Aggies too.\nI loved the fast-paced environment and everything it had to offer. I learned how to multitask, handle difficult customers, and how to work as part of a team. I also learned how to communicate effectively and efficiently, which is a skill that I will carry with me to internship next summer with Lockheed Martin. Even though it will be quite different, I know that the skills I gained from my restaurant job will be of great value to me. The opportunity to work in a restaurant was a valuable and enjoyable experience that I will never forget."

I have attended SEC sponsored events and I think they are key to informing TAMU students about the engineering programs and opportunities for their futures. I was especially impressed with Industry Night because it provides the opportunity for students to hear from professional engineers working in different industries. I also attended Department Information (DI) Saturday last spring which confirmed my choice for ETAM. This Spring I attended the SEC Career Fair where I interacted with representatives from companies and government agencies. Each of these SEC events help inform and inspire engineering students as they pursue their degree and career. I\u2019d be honored to be able to help put on these events to make them successful for my fellow Aggie engineers.",
            "Question 8": "When I determined I wanted to be an Aggie engineer I knew I had chosen a tough path. I put together the best application I could and waited. When I finally heard back, I was so excited to be admitted, but honestly, I felt I had somehow failed because I was offered engineering at the Galveston campus. It was difficult to explain to people that Galveston was a part of A&M and I was taking all the same freshman engineering classes. Although the campus was isolated and activities limited, I determined to take advantage of the small class size, find good study partners, participate in College Station events that were offered, and prepare for ETAM. I\u2019m very proud to have been offered my first choice of ISEN. This experience taught me to work hard to reach my goals, and it gave me confidence in my own abilities.

As Line Sergeant I was the liaison to the new members and I was responsible for making sure they knew what was expected, were prepared for events, and were comfortable within the team. As Chaplain, I spoke before each event providing inspirational words to calm and motivate the team. I really enjoyed this work because I got to work with the other officers to come up with ideas, plan the activities, and then lead the team through them. It was especially satisfying to see the team bonding and working together. I knew my contribution mattered because it was important for us to be in sync as a team in order to perform to the best of our ability."

Any student can learn textbook information for a desired job whether it may be in a classroom or an online course, but Professional skills cannot be learned the same way. There are many resources available to improve your professional skills but simply reading about these tips will not develop your skills. Key skills that most job recruiters look for in their new hires are Conscientiousness, Interpersonal skills, and Adaptability. These skills require practice and repetition to learn from your failures and prepare yourself for the future. Within SEC the exposure to collaboration, deadlines, and presentations allows students to practice these skills to prepare them for their desired engineering field.",
            "Question 8": "Being punctual was definitely a weakness that I had to overcome when I first came to college. The merciless Chemistry 107 tardy policy was ruthless. On the second day of lab I walked in 5 minutes late. The TA walked up to me, gave a disappointing sigh, and said \u201chey man I have already begun my presentation. You\u2019re going to have to make up this lab at another time.\u201d Only 2 weeks into college, my heart sank hearing this and it felt like an absolute low for me. This experience allowed me to rethink the importance of being punctual. Though this experience had consequences, those consequences are very minuscule compared to the consequences enforced in a Job or Internship. Consequences may range anywhere from losing a very important business deal/client to losing your job in general. Being punctual is very important in the real world, and I'm glad I was able to find the value of this trait. After this experience, I adapted to wearing a watch at all times and began scheduling my plans for the day to make sure I get to places or get assignments done on time.",
            "Question 9": "This past summer I had the opportunity to work at Chick-fil-A as a shift lead. Working at Chick-fil-a I had the opportunity to work with multiple leaders of various ages, career backgrounds, and educational differences. We had weekly meetings to express concern about the business, improve certain aspects of the production line, and enhance customer interactions. What I most enjoyed about working with these leaders was that regardless of our differences/backgrounds we were all able to collaborate with an open mind and focus on one goal - how to improve the business. We were able to contribute knowledge from our previous experiences and come to a calculated decision on how to adjust certain aspects of the business. Although there were disagreements within our meetings, we were able to professionally explain the pros and cons of an idea and make an appropriate conclusion rather than just dismissing an opinion. I would always look forward to these meetings because it allowed me to collaborate with other leaders and appropriately address our different ideas of the business despite our position in the restaurant."

            "Question 8": "Over the course of the past fall semester, I have been applying to dozens of positions just for a chance to get a summer internship in my specified field. Despite my best effort to prepare for the first few that I received, the answers that I supplemented for those interviewers were not up to par of the company's expectations, and therefore resulted in the reception of over 15 rejection letters. While this period of time was extremely frustrating and demoralizing, throughout this time period I was able to slowly but surely develop my verbal and writing skills. As all the companies were rejecting me, I figured the issue stemmed from my resume, and I learned how to fine tune and write it in a fashion that defined my achievements while also listing what I am able to bring to the table. In addition to develop writing skills, I also develop my verbal communication skills with recruiters and interviewers. Over the course of this development, I eventually achieved successful results with interviewers and am currently deciding between offers from multiple companies for a summer position. Without the first onslaught of rejection letters and failures, I wouldn't of ever developed my professional writing and verbal skills to the point that it current is at.",

In this role, the duty of the individual working at the desk is to keep track of all the residential keys and access cards for the Southside residential halls, while also simultaneously servicing the individuals that were staying on campus at the time. The main reason for my enjoyment throughout my time at this position was most through the period of when NSC was occurring. Over the period of a couple weeks, we had to accommodate roughly 5000 families on campus with housing, tours, meal services, amongst a host of other things that came with the inflow or residents. While it an overwhelming amount of work, it was enjoyable simply due to me being one of the student's first interactions at Texas A&M. That simple fact made it really special for me to interact with the incoming freshmen, and being able to display the qualities of what defines an Aggie was one of the more significant things that I took away from this particular job."

My desire to lead in the SEC was sparked when I learned about the Envision Conference, and has only increased since I attended a SEC informational. It was really exciting to hear about the many different committees that I could serve on, and I particularly enjoyed hearing about the philanthropy committee and their work to increase Zachry community through the breakroom takeovers and the REACH project. I know that I could be a valuable part of SEC, especially by serving on philanthropy, because of my passion and eagerness for fostering excitement and interest in STEM and engineering.",
            "Question 8": "In my senior year of high school, my class went on a retreat where we were introduced to varying tasks. The most memorable and challenging one for me was the blindfolded maze. In this exercise, we were instructed to reach out for one of the people staggered around the maze for help and guidance if needed. Yet even before the challenge had begun, I had already decided that there was no chance that I was giving up. After a significant period of time during which I had no success in determining the right path to the exit, I was instructed to remove the blindfold. As my vision returned, it was revealed that I, alone, remained in the maze and that there was no exit. The point of the exercise had been to ask for help, where you would then be released from the maze by one of the guides. I now understand that although my independence and determination are strengths, they can quickly become weaknesses if not matched with humility. This specific failure taught me the importance of asking for help and allowed me to understand that support from others is a resource rather than an embarrassment or shortcoming.",
            "Question 9": "The best and most enjoyable class I took over the course of my high school career was an honors engineering elective. In this class, we were divided into teams and presented with a new project to work on each week. One week we would be writing the code for a program that would output the notes for a specified song and the next we would be designing and constructing a mouse-trap car that was required to travel a designated distance sans motor or human intervention. I loved the collaboration and teamwork elements of this class and found it very fulfilling to be able to share all of our individual perspectives and approaches to the challenge. It was consistently interesting and rewarding to watch our project grow and evolve with the addition of each individual\u2019s ideas. Through this experience, I have come to understand that the group effort and collaboration of a team working harmoniously produces a greater effect than the singular labor of an individual. I know that being a member of the SEC would be an amazing opportunity for me to expand my leadership skills and discipline by working with other students to serve my fellow engineers."

            "Question 8": "Last semester, there was an instance where I almost lost a friendship because I failed to fulfill a promise that I had made. The moment when it was clear that I had nearly lost the friendship that I had somehow maintained over the course of the past seven years hit me like a train. It was a stinging wake-up call, indicating that I needed to change immediately. I reevaluated the entirety of my college career and decided that I needed to learn how to prioritize different aspects of my life at different times and manage my time better as a whole. Since that incident, I have significantly improved the way I have allocated time to the different pieces of my life. I have also started to pay more attention to the way I treat the people that I surround myself with, keeping in mind that they are around me because they care. Not only have I successfully repaired my friendship, but I have also designed a better system to organize my various events and assignments for the day.

As an engineering student, having access to career fairs and workshops that provide preparation for job searching and interviews is invaluable. At industry night I was given the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the different engineering fields available and which ones I liked the most. Coming from a family with no engineers, being able to make contacts and gain experience in a field while still in school is life-changing. It has allowed me to explore various career paths and identify the potential internships that are most suitable for my interests. All in all, the SEC is an outstanding source for professional growth and I am grateful for their dedication to helping me build my career path.",
            "Question 8": "I remember the disappointment I felt when I failed my first chemistry test in college. After days of preparation and studying, I was convinced that I had done enough to ace the exam, only to be faced with a far less than satisfactory grade. I went into a state of denial, blaming my professor and the difficulty of the material for my failure. It wasn\u2019t until later that I came to realize that the problem was me. I hadn\u2019t fully taken into account the new style of learning that college required, nor had I put in the necessary effort needed to succeed. This realization was a huge motivator for me, and from then on I took every test as an opportunity to learn more about myself and my subject matter. By incorporating studying methods such as mind maps and block studying, I improved my grades. Now when faced with challenges, big or small, I take a step back and evaluate what went wrong so that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Failing is a hard pill to swallow but it can be turned into a valuable learning experience if you take responsibility and focus on how you can become better from it.",
            "Question 9": "I was always a very shy person, so when I started working in a jewelry store doing sales, it intimidated me at first. But eventually, I became more confident over time.

I remember how driven I felt by the challenge of meeting and exceeding my daily targets, and how proud I was once I'd achieved them. Every person's needs felt like a puzzle that I had to figure out in order to find the right piece of jewelry for them. What made this job special for me was that I got to be creative with the customer's requests, like combining different chains with pendants, to make sure they always left feeling happy and taken care of. It was so gratifying to be able to put a smile on someone's face with my customer service and help them find something they liked.

My first time attending the Career Fair was a last minute decision that fortunately boosted my confidence and knowledge in professionally communicating. Putting myself out there helped me speak to recruiters with interest and eagerness regardless of being a freshman which many companies do not seek to hire. However, many freshmen feel intimidated to participate and lose a valuable opportunity to network. I aspire to help change this perception by promoting such events as a learning opportunity for students, which can help them feel more comfortable engaging in activities.

            "Question 8": "My senior year of high school involved a lot of courses in which teamwork was vital. During a capstone project for my engineering class, I took it upon myself to finish my teammates' tasks, believing I was doing them a favor. However, this resulted in my teammates not being able to contribute to the project and having limited knowledge of what we had accomplished. When the time came to present our invention, it was clear that the project was not created as a team effort and we received no recognition for our work. Not only had I created a failed project, but I failed my team as a team member. After my teammates approached me with honesty, I realized how my actions had negatively impacted not only the project but my teammates. Since then, I have made a conscious effort to consider different ideas and advice and to not take control in any teamwork. Considering my teammates\u2019 inputs and ideas has enhanced the projects ever since and helped me better connect with them. This has improved my communication and social skills in college and has helped me to better understand the value of teamwork.",

There were a variety of activities and presentations to perform, but it would not have been made possible without my team. Preparing and discussing innovative ideas to create a productive lesson made the experience more exciting from the start; we were able to share this unique and fun occasion in which we were passionate about: teaching others. Collaborating and dividing the work to complete the extensive lesson in under 5 hours made me value teamwork more than I ever did and made the experience livelier rather than finishing a job. I thoroughly enjoyed this work because I was able to spend time teaching students valuable lessons that will help them succeed in the future."

            "Question 7": "The most imperative pillar of the SEC Mission Statement to me is increasing engineering awareness. The progression of society and the wellbeing of human life depends on the many engineering disciplines that have shaped our present day technology and infrastructure. Therefore it is essential that we continue to inspire and expose creative young minds to the field. Increasing awareness through SEC programs enables the next generation of future engineers to begin developing critical thinking skills while simultaneously energizing them for what could come next in their education and career. The advancement of society and the survival of the engineering profession depends on how well we cultivate those who will come after us. We are not here merely to better ourselves and our careers, but to guide and mentor others so that when we are gone, our shared legacy of creativity and determination can live on!",
            "Question 8": "In the fall of 2022, I failed. I took on too much responsibility for the amount of time I had available, combining a much more involved leadership position in the Corps of Cadets, Aggie Band football game and practice obligations, extracurriculars, and a heavy course load. Until this point, I had been successful in every endeavor, able to handle challenging mental and physical situations. However, I was not yet skilled at efficiently managing my mental state and by extension time. Through immense procrastination and overcommitting, I broke down my ability to cope. Because of this, I ended up having to drop a class that should have been manageable to me. This was a turning point in my outlook on education and life in general. Despite my previous success, I had not allowed myself to live and enjoy my life, typically choosing to smother my social life and mental health in favor of grinding to keep grades up. During this challenge, I learned much needed skills for how to effectively manage my time and understand my limits. As I continue through college, I will keep these lessons in mind and continue to keep pushing myself in a healthy way.",
            "Question 9": "During spring 2021, I was a member of the Freshman Drill Team (FDT), a special unit in the Corps of Cadets that competes and wins nationally every year. As a member of FDT, I practiced and drilled for 20 hours per week in addition to Corps and Engineering responsibilities. I was a member of two portions of the competition. The first was inspection, which was expected to be perfect from the shine on your shoes to the shave on your neck, including military knowledge. The second portion was regulation, which marched perfected platoon sized regulation drills, focusing on complete discipline and uniformity. I gained a significant amount of resilience and a tight knit group of friends through shared suffering and hard work on the team. Although FDT was one of if not the most challenging experiences of my life, it taught me how to truly work hard and devote myself to a greater purpose for my peers to the left and right of me. I enjoyed the experience most because of the reward of finally accomplishing a task with a group of people I had poured my heart and soul into and who had done the same for me."

            "Question 8": "As a Blood Drive Chair, I encountered a setback during the fall semester when I failed to recruit enough volunteers to staff the event. However, I learned from this experience and used it as an opportunity to grow. I realized that I had underestimated the amount of planning and coordination required for the event and that my communication with volunteers had been ineffective.\nDetermined to improve, I made sure to create a detailed plan and timeline for future events, with clear roles and responsibilities for all volunteers. I also established better communication channels with volunteers, ensuring that everyone was informed and on the same page. Additionally, I reached out to other student organizations and community groups for support and collaboration, which helped to increase volunteer turnout.\nAs a result of these efforts, I was able to recruit a lot more people the following spring semester. This was a testament to the fact that failure can be an opportunity for growth. I learned that with the right approach and by being proactive, I was able to turn my failure into success. The experience taught me that it's important to take responsibility for my actions and to use my mistakes as a learning opportunity to improve in the future.",
            "Question 9": "The project I worked on with the Forge Outreach team(at UTD. I am a transfer student from there) was a mineral picking robot that was built from scratch. The robot was designed to pick up small items and place them inside a basket attached to the top of the robot. The robot was controlled remotely by a person in a different room, who operated it based on feedback from the sensors.\nOne of the main challenges of the project was coding the ultrasonic distance sensor, HC-SR04, using Energia (C/C++). This required me to have a good understanding of the sensor's capabilities and how to use it to detect the distance between the robot and potential objects. Additionally, I also had to solder and 3D print some parts to build the chassis of the robot.\nI enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to apply my technical skills in coding, soldering and 3D printing to a real-world problem and to see the end result of my hard work. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and it was great to be part of a team that was passionate about the project. Furthermore, getting evaluated by the department head and one other professor was a great opportunity to get feedback and to know that our work is being recognized."

            "Question 7": "As a minority, being underrepresented has been a barrier I have struggled to understand up until coming to A&M. Being born in McAllen, Texas, I come from a homogeneous Hispanic community. I lived in comfort and stability being around people who shared my culture and looks. Being underrepresented was not an issue. Coming to A&M was the first time I experienced an environment where I was in the minority. Due to that, I needed help finding myself and a support group I could rely on for guidance. The pillar which means the most to me is the mission to be the representative voice of all engineering students. Being a minority in a predominantly white institution, it is of grave importance to me that I stand up for underrepresented people. Ensuring all voices are heard, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender, is essential for any organization and a pillar I take to heart.",
            "Question 8": "Three semesters ago, I failed my first class in my academic career. The course was CSCE 121. That semester, my Grade Point Average was at an all-time low of 1.8. The feeling of failure, disappointment, and depression has never flowed through me as highly as it did during that time. I felt my world collapsing beneath my feet, and I thought my time at A&M was ending. So how did I grow from that experience? Since receiving my grade for that semester, I have become more open to making peers and talking to professors and counselors. With that, I have become more engaged with academics by pursuing acquaintances with my class peers and regularly attending office hours. Since then, my GPA has consistently climbed, and I have found motivation and purpose in my education.",
            "Question 9": "Back in my hometown of McAllen, Texas, there is a refugee center for Central and South Americans immigrating to the U.S. I have volunteered there since my sophomore year of high school. As a result, I have formed a sentimental bond with the importance of that center. Volunteering there involves handing out clothing, food, and essential items to newly arriving people. Along with that, other tasks include playing with and comforting the children who come. Sadly, some of these children come alone, so grave importance is set on maintaining their innocence through the unimaginable tough time they are experiencing. I enjoy this job because although the situation is unbearable, putting smiles on their faces and making the transition to their new life as seamless as possible brings me joy. Since volunteering there, I have been grateful for my family, my living situation, and the food I receive without a second thought."

            "Question 7": "The objective of the SEC\u2019s mission statement that means the most to me is the first pillar of representation. I feel that by developing impactful relationships in this close-knit organization, my fellow members and I would be able to represent ourselves effectively as one. Having been passionate about engineering for so long, I find it vital that we are given a platform to express our love for the endeavor we have worked endlessly to pursue. Moreover, by having the privilege of representation as an SEC member, we can educate others about the shared adversity engineering students face, as well as the rewarding satisfaction that comes from seeing the impact of our work on society. Conclusively, this pillar is the most meaningful, as representation allows the engineering students in the SEC to not only accomplish the other two objectives more effectively, but it also encourages members to use their voices.",
            "Question 8": "At the start of high school, I did not realize how drastic the change would be from eighth to ninth grade. I was enrolled in the very rigorous International Baccalaureate Program, and I realized after seeing my first report card, that something within me had to change because I was getting grades I never received before. During this time, I truly experienced the feelings of failure and hopelessness, as I thought that no matter how hard I worked, I would never succeed because it was \u201ctoo hard\u201d for me. From freshman to senior year, I had to play catch-up because of how poorly I started, and there were countless times that I wanted to drop out of the program altogether because the damage seemed irreversible. I realized, however, that although I couldn\u2019t change the past, I could put in 100% effort to improve my GPA as much as possible. By persevering, I went from not even being ranked, to graduating in the IB Program at the top 6% of my class. Through this experience, I learned that it is never too late to make up for a past failure, and it is these failures that lead to our greatest successes.",
            "Question 9": "Before transferring to A&M, I was blessed with the opportunity to work as an Apple Technician. From a young age, I was always fascinated by technology, which compelled me to learn how intricate engineering allows for seamless operation. As I grew older, I expanded my knowledge of technology by watching videos, reading articles, and learning directly from subject matter experts, which ultimately sparked my desire to help people who were unknowingly using their devices inefficiently. As a technician, my job was not only to troubleshoot and fix devices through either a software or hardware standpoint, but it was also to let the customer leave knowing more about their device than they did when arriving. As mentioned, it was my goal to teach others about the incredible versatility technology provides to our daily lives, so to be able to combine both passions of mine in a professional setting was what made this work experience so enjoyable. I learned to sympathize and be patient in order to provide a solution to the customer. By putting myself in their shoes, I understand the importance of an effective learning experience, and knowing that I can help someone this way brings me immense joy."

            "Question 7": "While I feel that all pillars of the SEC Mission Statement are important, the one that stands out to me most is striving to be the representative voice of all engineering students. I feel as though there are several engineering students on campus that don\u2019t fit the mold of a traditional engineer, myself included. As a female engineer whose background is rooted in agriculture, I find myself in many scenarios being the \u2018odd man out' when compared to other engineering students. I believe that it is important to acknowledge and include every background and individual in the field of engineering to foster new ideas and advancements. The saying that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, matches the feeling that being the representative voice of all engineering students brings me because even greater things could come from this university when collaboration and representation of all individuals is enhanced.",
            "Question 8": "My freshman year of high school, I thought I was going to be a star volleyball player because I was a semi-decent player on my club team. After tryouts however, I found myself as a benchwarmer on the freshman team, not where I had intended myself to be. While this may not seem like a true \u2018failure\u2019, at the time, I felt as though I had failed myself. I continued working hard both academically and athletically that year, and my sophomore year, I found myself not on the team I felt I deserved to be on again. On top of that my coach refused to share with any of my other extracurricular activities. This series of a feeling of failure became the most influential part of my life as it became the fuse that lit my involvement and passion for FFA and agriculture. The organization that I never thought I would join, yet somehow gravitated too. Experiences from joining FFA have taught me more leadership and career skills than ever imaginable. Growing from failing at sports, led me into finding a passion that showed me an industry that I hope to continue to be involved in as an agricultural engineer.",
            "Question 9": "My parents have had me working since I can remember on our family cattle ranch. I have experienced sorting cattle, working on equipment, and pasture maintenance on that piece of property. However, the one job I truly enjoy is building fence. From clearing brush lines to tying the wire to the posts, every aspect is enjoyable to me. This job used to take place with simple hand tools and we have progressed it to heavy machinery driving and setting the posts. I enjoy the ability to truly do \u2018men\u2019s work\u2019 and get my hands dirty. If I had to recall a favorite event building fence, it would be when my dad and I were repairing a section along the road after a vehicle had run into a section. While the local sheriff\u2019s department was reporting the accident, they noticed that I was the one stretching and tying the wire to the posts and admitted they were impressed I knew such skills as a 15 year-old-female. To me, any type of work is enjoyable when I can see the project from start to finish and all that it entails, and that is what building fences has brought me."

            "Question 7": "Ever since I was a child, I had always known that I wanted to be an engineer eventually. This was thanks to idolizing my grandfather and the engineering work he had done in his lifetime. Throughout my youth he had found a way to instill the basic mindset of an engineer in me by working with me on things such as my science fair projects. Thanks to him I was aware of the work of an engineer, I believe that this organization does the same through its programs and events. These events serve to increase engineering awareness in the community, whether that be the university or younger students in nearby communities. Events such as Envision give children experience with engineering concepts and exemplify the way that we can increase awareness from a young age. Seeing how my early awareness of engineering impacted me, makes this pillar especially important to me.",
            "Question 8": "As a student in high school, I was obsessed with building my resume in order to guarantee entrance into any university I might apply for. Due to this I failed to maintain and care for friendships the way that most high school students would. I didn\u2019t find my life-long best friend or college roommate through high school. Instead, later on I figured out that my failure in this aspect of my life was something that I needed to greatly improve on in my college life. While everyone in college has the same initial struggle with trying to find friends, I was more worried on how I would make time to maintain these friendships once I had found them. In order to overcome this shortcoming, I did things like make more free time for myself by blocking my work together and not turning down spur of the moment invitations. Doing simple things like this allowed me to maintain better relationships with friends, and build a supportive community here at Texas A&M. I feel as if this is something that I can continue to build as I meet new people in classes or through student organizations.",

Throughout the summer I worked with kids and special needs adults in order to provide them with a memorable experience that they would go and tell their friends and family about. On a daily basis I was required to follow a strict schedule, maintain safety standards on various activities, and keep track of a whole cabin. At the same time I was able to be a role model in many ways for these campers throughout their time at camp. I was given the amazing opportunity to converse with all the campers, perform skits that made them laugh, and facilitate high ropes activities that allowed them to push their limits. Upon the conclusion of each term, I was able to see them reunite with their parents and hear them tell the stories of how much fun they had. I enjoyed this job greatly due to the chance I was given to make the summer of each camper that came through those gates, whether or not they knew what the week had in store for them."

Coming from a non-engineering background, I was not familiar with the opportunities and benefits a career in engineering could bring. Initially, my family encouraged me to pursue a career in medicine, as that was the only field they were familiar with. However, after attending a high school career fair and having the chance to interact with engineers, I was inspired to explore the field. These experiences showed me the potential for applying my math skills in new ways and developing skills such as problem solving and team building. With this newfound understanding, I aim to raise awareness about engineering among future students and encourage them to consider this fulfilling career path.",
            "Question 8": "Last summer, I interned as an engineer with my city council, tasked with researching the various utility bills in other cities and creating a precise graph comparing water and waste charges. My advisor used this graph to formulate their budget plan for 2023.\nHowever, in my enthusiasm to complete my task, I made a crucial mistake. I assumed that the residential water charge was the same as the nonresidential charge, which turned out to be incorrect. This resulted in my advisor having to work with flawed data, which could potentially impact the budgeting process.\nI learned a valuable lesson from this experience. It highlighted the significance of thoroughly verifying information and not hesitating to ask questions when uncertain. I now understand that even small errors or incorrect assumptions can have significant consequences, and it is always better to double-check and clarify information for accuracy. Moving forward, I am committed to approaching my work with extra care and attention to detail, asking questions as needed and ensuring that all information is verified and correct.",
            "Question 9": "One of my most memorable experiences was when I worked as a Sales Associate at Athleta. During this time, I had the chance to improve my teamwork skills. Before every shift, my manager would give an overview of the weekly revenue goals and strategies to reach them. This emphasized the important role I played in supporting the team's objectives.\nInteracting with customers was a highlight of my job. I utilized my product knowledge to make personalized recommendations and provide a memorable shopping experience. For instance, I remember an older woman who came into the store searching for hiking gear for an upcoming trip. She mentioned her worries about thigh chafing, and I was able to suggest hiking pants that solved the problem. She later came back to share with me that her hiking experience was much more enjoyable thanks to her new pants. Hearing this was very rewarding.\nMy passion for positive interactions and teamwork is a defining aspect of my character, and this role allowed me to further enhance these skills. Working as a Sales Associate at Athleta was a valuable opportunity for me to cultivate a positive attitude and a commitment to excellence in customer service."

This was something that I never initially imagined doing when I joined, but in time I fell in love with the organization and wanted to solidify a leading role within it. On shorter notice than I\u2019d initially hoped, I brainstormed, wrote, practiced, and eventually delivered a speech to the entire active chapter, but ultimately fell short. Although going out for an executive position was ambitious for a freshman, I have no regrets looking back. I learned a lot about myself during that time and knew that this minor setback would never stop me from finding my greater role at this university. Before college, I never intended to join a fraternity or especially an executive position. It\u2019s reassuring to remember that I\u2019ve wanted to lead an engineering-oriented organization ever since I submitted my TAMU application.

The work I\u2019ve completed here will be useful for my career, which has completely restored my love for learning. My favorite task so far has come from MEEN 210, a class completely based on Solidworks. Three other students and I oversaw the designing and manufacturing of a toy made for the elderly. I wish I had more room to go into detail, but it was what I consider the most enriching experience I\u2019ve had as a student so far. With minimal oversight from the professor, the four of us distributed workloads, managed a budget, and resolved conflicts for an entire semester. The challenge was daunting, but I remember being so invested in my work with students that were equally as motivated to succeed around me. The experience was not just enjoyable but fruitful for my communication and collaboration skills which I will utilize for the rest of my academic and professional career."

            "Question 7": "The pillar that means the most to me is increasing engineering awareness through programs and events. Engineering is a critical job that is important to all fields of study, not just engineering. By increasing awareness of engineering, within the college of engineering, but also outside of it, we can reach a larger audience and hopefully inspire and mentor incoming or hopeful engineering students. I love to volunteer. I try to participate in as many philanthropy events as I can, and through that experience, I have learned the way to reach others about important subjects is to present information in a way that will be received well. Something enjoyable, but also professional. I think that increasing awareness does not have to be a large event, although those are important. Often the smaller events, like giving back to the community, are more personal and can make the most impact.",
            "Question 8": "I stress bake. In high school, my friends would always ask me to bake and decorate cakes for them, which I was more than happy to do. With a million steps in the process, disaster can strike at any time. Unfortunately for me, it happened when I was making a cake for my best friend\u2019s birthday. Everything went wrong at once. I forgot to add the eggs and remembered this after the cakes were in the pans. I fixed it, but the cakes did not rise properly. The lemon filling did not thicken for the first time in the probably 30 times I have made it. The frosting was gritty and too sweet. Then, after I had finally worked through all of these problems and persevered, I dropped it putting it in my car. I ended up making a quick chocolate cake that I found a box mix for in the back of the pantry. Everyone at the party loved the cake. Through this horrible cake experience, I learned sometimes things just go wrong, but that you are much more critical of yourself than anyone else. It helped me understand how you respond to challenges is more important than perfection.",
            "Question 9": "My first real job was with an event planning company. It was one of the best experiences of my life because it taught me so many lessons, and the product was always beautiful. We sometimes worked 12-hour days, but it became something I was passionate about. We would load the truck with all of our supplies, drive to the site, and begin our very long day of perfecting the event. We worked a LOT of bat/bar mitzvahs, but weddings were always my favorite. I would spend all day carrying surprisingly heavy buckets full of flowers, blowing up balloons, creating installations, setting out linens, and running around trying to make sure we all had everything we needed to ensure we exceeded our client's expectations. The chaos was worth it to give someone their dream event, whether that be a wedding, birthday, or charity fundraiser. It taught me how to lead under pressure, and how to plan things, not only for how you hope them to go, but for every potential problem. It also taught me to see things through the whole process and how to motivate a team to create the best result."

            "Question 7": "Engineering awareness is the one of the three SEC pillars that means the most to me. To me, engineering awareness entails having the power to influence an entire community or even just one person. For instance, when I worked with children at an outreach center last summer, I was really impacted by the moment I saw them begin to look to someone for leadership. Coming from a place where engineering is not as advanced, I was grateful to know that I had made a difference in their lives. As I represent the pillar of engineering awareness, I would love to revisit this event in a fresh way. Being a part of the EnVision Conference will help me in my goal of impacting lives during my time at Texas A&M and reaching out to children, adults, and different societies with wonders of what the engineering world has to offer.",
            "Question 8": "My first college exam was one instance where failing helped me grow. I was used to receiving good grades all the time in high school, but entering college was a significant step up from that. I consequently obtained a poor grade on my first exam in my engineering class. I was pretty upset about the grade because it made me feel like I wasn't supposed to be here and that I wasn't bright enough to continue in engineering. But after I had established a group of encouraging friends, it really improved my outlook. This community made me develop a mindset that as long as I tried and studied all that I could, a grade, whether it be good or bad, does not define me as a person. Having had this experience, I hope to be able to help others find a supportive community within the college of engineering and get them through what I went through.",
            "Question 9": "My summer work was one activity that I truly enjoyed doing. Children between the ages of 5 and 13 can attend our summer program while their parents went off to work or ran errands. It was my responsibility to look after the children that were dropped off, to keep them safe while also entertaining and educating them. There was never a time where I wasn't bored because every day brought something fresh. They were always making jokes, and they'd often call me Batman. Because of them, I always looked forward to going to work, and in the end, I found that they would enjoy seeing me. Going home and placing the souvenirs they made for me on that certain day in a box with their other small gifts was my favorite part of the entire experience. Being with them was such a wonderful experience that I hope I can make an even bigger impact in SEC just as I did with those kids."

            "Question 7": "Out of the three pillars from the mission statement, I would say that fostering professional advancement means the most to me. I connect the most with this pillar because it is an opportunistic pathway to the application of the education we receive at this university. The knowledge we gain from education can only take us so far; interacting in the real world and finding a place to use that education is a step up that is not normally outlined for students. The SEC fostering a professional atmosphere through events, such as career fairs and company informational nights for freshmen, acts as a mediator of sorts between the education and the real world. Providing information and opportunities for how to be successful beyond what one might learn in the classroom is just as important as the education inside the classroom.",
            "Question 8": "Growing up, I was a competitive gymnast and it was truly my entire life. I believe gymnastics to be the toughest sport there is, both mentally and physically. I credit mostly every life lesson that I have learned to gymnastics and my coaches. When I was 15, I missed the cut for the elite qualification meet by two places (just one of the many, many times I had failed). After little consideration, I decided to quit the sport instead of training another year to just possibly fail at the same meet a year later. I wanted to be a \u201cnormal\u201d teenager who went to school and hung out with her friends. I regret quitting so easily. Rule number one in gymnastics is that you will fail, and you will fail so many times that you almost get comfortable with failing. This one particular failure and the decisions I made afterward taught me that failure is inevitable, you trade it in one way for another. I still find myself failing like I did then and being presented with the opportunity to quit, but I am forever reminded of how I have to be comfortable with failure in order to succeed.",
            "Question 9": "A time that I enjoyed doing work was almost the entirety of senior year of high school. I say this because it was one of the first times I felt like I had a say in what I was learning. The classes that I chose in my schedule were ones that I actually found interesting, especially my Government and Apologetics classes. Senior year was daunting to most because in the honors sections of these classes, students had to write an 80-page thesis dissertation on a subject of their choosing and defend it in front of the school and faculty, and also create a set of political ideologies that they would explain and defend in front of the senior class and government teacher. Though these were the toughest assignments I\u2019ve ever had to complete, I enjoyed having the freedom to choose what I wanted to write about or research and defend to actually challenge my beliefs. Instead of finding information that would prove myself right, I would find ways I could prove myself wrong, and I found it fun. I finally began to understand why I believed what I did, while also being educated on other perspectives I might otherwise neglect."

It means the most to me because I am so confident that every Aggie engineer has the skills and knowledge to bring a real change to the world. That belief in this amazing program at Texas A&M is the reason I want every student to try and have an opportunity in the professional world as an engineer working on the next big things, or even coming up with their own inventions/ideas. A student shouldn\u2019t have to look far to find their answer to what they will do after they graduate, instead, have a clear path and a plan ahead of them.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, marching band was pretty much at the core of my experiences, and eventually, with my hard work I was able to be elected to be the leader of my section twice for my junior and senior years, but that is not to say I did not struggle with the responsibility at first. During my first year as a section leader, I struggled to really connect with people in my section and listen to the things they had to say. Instead of bringing unity to the section, I was selfish and brought it even further apart. In my senior year, with the new freshmen coming in I wanted to really make a positive change; making a complete 180. Seeing how terribly my junior was, I learned that I should take responsibility for my actions, listen to what other people have to say, and become not only a leader to them but also someone they can look up to and be an example. Through this, I grew a student and mentor relationship between two of my section members, which further pushed me to improve myself going forward to inspire others.",
            "Question 9": "Over the past 3 summers, I have gotten to be involved in the family business which is in construction and custom homes. Mostly I was in charge of working with my uncle on the estimating side which had me working with a program called Takeoff to calculate the volume and area of material needed to complete a project. After this, we would then calculate the total costs with our suppliers and our resources before submitting our bid. When it was not estimating, I was out with my father in meetings with customers and visiting projects. What I so much enjoyed about doing this work was that I was able to learn so much, which included the building process, the communication needed, the time management to get bids submitted on time, networking, and being professional. However, most of all, what I really enjoyed was visiting the projects and getting to talk to customers. It fascinated me that all my work could really be seen in person and make an impact on people\u2019s livelihoods, and this it was has inspired me to work hard to continue making a change, not as an estimator or businessman, but as an engineer."

            "Question 7": "Working as an intern at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, I was exposed to how a professional and collaborative environment worked at a true engineering level. At work, I learned from colleagues that one of their biggest struggles entering the workforce was a lack of exposure to professional work settings. For this reason, I believe that fostering the professional advancement of all engineering disciplines is the most important pillar that the SEC has. As students are working their way through college, they should also have the opportunity to develop professional skills that will be crucial to their success in their future careers. Unfortunately, not many classes within engineering focus on the development and applications of building professional skills, despite it being one of the most important skills to have as a working adult. Giving aggie engineers the ability to grow professionally will aid in their ability to obtain internships and secure jobs.",
            "Question 8": "The COVID-19 lockdown was a time filled with failure when it came to my organizational skills. My whole educational life prior to COVID was almost brainlessly dictated by a ringing bell and a provided schedule. Once COVID brought school to online learning, the schedules disappeared, and teachers would only email their assignments and zoom dates. For the first couple weeks I was clueless as to where I should even start with my work, and it resulted in countless 12-hour days and missed zoom calls. I was unsuccessful at keeping up with the assignments and put together a schedule. The most beneficial part of this online learning was optional assignments, meaning that I could completely work out a good schedule through pure trial and error. After a couple weeks I finally had my schedule in control and could somewhat successfully prioritize my workload. It truly took about two months of failing and refining my skills to finally feel a sense of mastery in prioritization and organization. In the years following the pandemic, I have been able to more effectively manage my time while continuing to grow and adapt my skills to my environments, whether it be at work, school, or social.",
            "Question 9": "The most enjoyable experience working was during my senior year in my high school band. That year I received a leadership role as percussion/drumline captain for our marching band. This position entailed countless leadership training, leading the percussion section in rehearsal, and acting as an instructor in a director\u2019s absence. I was spending around 10-20 hours a week working with directors and students, and each hour both challenged and excited me. For the previous 6 years, I grew each day as a follower, but the time came for me to grow as a leader, and I worked to get the most I could out of it. I enjoyed pushing both myself and my peers to be the best musicians that we could. I felt incredibly rewarded to see the genuine impact I had on my peers. The enjoyment didn\u2019t solely come from the challenges present in the position, but it also derived from the relationships I formed with all of the percussionists. Thanks to my amazing peers and the countless obstacles I learned to overcome and grow from, my position as captain was without a doubt the most enjoyable work I have ever done."

In this day and age, ideas and breakthroughs are happening rapidly in all areas of STEM. To allow technology to continue to flourish, I want to directly contribute to the planning and organization of various engineering programs throughout all levels of education. Throughout my primary education, the way engineering was introduced to me was bland and predictable, with most of it being able to apply formulas. This changed when I attended UTMB\u2019s summer stem program. The program showed me the sides of engineering that I had envisioned in movies and pop culture. We ran forensics tests. Speakers spoke of revolutionizing projects involving rocket ships. We applied the theories I had learned to construct real models. This was when the starry-eyed engineer in me was born. I want to create this same experience for others through the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "Camp CAMP is a summer camp for disabled children. As a counselor, I was paired up with a child and my job was attending to their needs. This included bathing, feeding, keeping them safe, and making sure they were sleeping well. From the moment I was paired up with my kid, it was a nightmare. He had oceans of energy and was as rampant as a raging bull. I tried to establish footing. Establish trust and respect. Establish some sort of mutual agreement and understanding. Disaster. I was not successful. The problem that I was facing was that I just wasn\u2019t able to communicate with the kid. I was not able to see from his perspective. After spending some time getting to know him and truly listen to him, I was able to perform my duties as a counselor better. I learned communication from this experience. Being able to communicate and work with children will be a critical skill for when I join EnVision. I will be able to take myself out of the lens of a college student and engineer, and place myself in the shoes of these students, and ultimately foster a better experience all around.",
            "Question 9": "I loved being a project manager for the Aggie Coding Club, and I will absolutely do it again in the future. As a project manager, I held weekly meetings with around 12 other engineering students at Texas A&M. During our meetings, we would start by talking about what how our classes were going and breaking the ice, then transitioning to the meeting. I made sure to make everyone feel included in the project and fostering a welcoming attitude. During the meetings, we talked about the direction of the project and any new ideas. We held mini projects throughout the semester, a few being a personal website and a pokedex. It was great connecting with other students and gaining new perspectives. At this point, I was unsure what I wanted to pursue professionally in the future, but talking to the other members helped me get more exposure. By the end of the semester, we had created an aggie market place and showcased it to the Aggie Coding Club. I enjoyed it because I love meeting new people and helping others learn. At the SEC, I hope to find the same fulfillment that I found at the Aggie Coding Club."

With the few encounters I\u2019ve had in the past year with professionals, I\u2019ve found that I felt slightly uncomfortable and out of place; I realize that the ability to handle yourself confidently and feel comfortable in these kinds of situations comes with time and practice, and it\u2019s one of my goals to work towards this.

            "Question 8": "In high school I opted to take IB Physics for fun. As someone who had never taken physics before, clearly this was an awful idea. Upon my first week of class, I learned two very important things\u2014I was horrible at physics, and it was far too tempting to fall asleep during my 7:45 am Zoom. This set the tone for the rest of the year, and when I was introduced to the IB exam, against my obvious judgment, I signed up. During the exam, I performed as expected\u2014I failed miserably. I circled random answers in the multiple choice, and I left multiple pages of the essay questions blank.\nTaking this exam was eye-opening for me. I learned that you never know when your readiness will be useful. If I had put more effort into my first year of physics, I can say certainly that I would have ultimately performed significantly better. It\u2019s why you should always put your 110% effort into everything you do\u2014your time and effort is a personal investment in being prepared for your future struggles. While you can\u2019t anticipate how you may struggle, it\u2019s worthwhile to make choices which will ultimately support you.",
            "Question 9": "Music is one of my biggest passions and something I pursued for practically my entire life. As with almost any endeavor, practicing and putting in time and effort is almost the only way to improve. As a piano player, the expectation I set for myself was to practice everyday\u2014whether it be simple scales or a concerto, doing this work was something I thoroughly enjoyed. Every extra day I sat down at the piano, I heard myself get better; every improvement I heard pushed me to sit down at the piano the next day; the thrill I experienced every time I felt myself getting closer to the end result was almost addicting. Having said this, practice did not always go smoothly. I struggled and inevitably got frustrated at times, but the knowledge that the final product of my work would be beautiful despite the process was an incentive for me. It\u2019s one of the many reasons why I love music\u2014it grounds me in a unique way. And seeing the joy on people\u2019s faces when I played for them, knowing everyone can find it in themselves to appreciate music, made my time and effort fully worth it."

            "Question 8": "I was caught up in the excitement of the Covid-19 stock market crash, like many novice traders. So focused on making quick gains, I disregarded logical thinking and made impulsive decisions based on emotions. This led me to take on high-risk trades, fueled by the fear of missing out on what I thought to be the next big thing. However, my luck soon ran out and I was faced with the harsh reality of my mistakes and losses. Despite the disappointments of losing trades, I learned a valuable lesson. I realized the importance of approaching decisions with clear and rational mindsets, rather than making impulsive moves driven by fear or excitement. This lesson has stayed with me and has helped me in all aspects of my life. From personal finances to professional choices, I now take a step back and consider the long-term outcomes of my actions before making any decisions.\nI am grateful for the growth and development stock trading sparked in me.

Being a director has shown me how much can be accomplished when like-minded individuals come together, with the goal of bettering the experiences of others.

Through my work, I created bonds and memories, which keep dear to my heart. My role specifically allows me to connect with members on a personal level, by giving them a chance to voice their true feelings as freshmen. FEST has taught me that when you genuinely love what you are doing, and those around you love it also, there are endless opportunities for growth and overachievement.

One of PREP\u2019s main goals was to develop our members professionally. Throughout the semester we organized an etiquette dinner, case competition, mock interviews, Linkedin and HireAggies workshops, and weekly knowledgeable speakers. These events were invaluable for me as a freshman and executive because often these soft skills are overlooked in A&M\u2019s college curriculum.

The gates were not opened until 8:15. Immediately, all the meticulous planning I did went out the window, and I began to get in my head. I kept telling myself I had failed and the event was ruined. My director pulled me aside and encouraged me. He told me he knew I could do it, I could face adversity and that\u2019s why I had been put in this role. I jumped back in and took charge.

Each time I had to fix something was like a little puzzle. A puzzle that required a significant amount of troubleshooting. I became very good at it, and I have been able to apply those troubleshooting skills to my college endeavors.

            "Question 7": "After attending the informational, the pillar of the SEC mission statement that stood out to me the most and the one I feel myself gravitating towards is the \"representative voice\". I believe one of the most powerful aspects of the SEC is its dynamic quality. The SEC listens to the engineering student community and is able to enact change through events such as the Presidents' Roundtable (I believe that's the name of the event). SEC members have the power to bring attention of pressing student concerns to the faculty and higher-ups who construct the foundation of our college experience. Thus, this organization takes part in a continual exchange of concerns and ideas between the student body, the council, and the faculty. This is a valuable quality that excites me about the SEC. Currently, I'm most interested in the Internal Relations, Legislation, and Society & Graduate Relations committees.",
            "Question 8": "When I was in my junior year of high school, I began the process of the International Baccalaureate program (commonly known as IB). This was a challenging undertaking, a) due to the online school format and b) the sudden increase in academic rigor and demand. Once we went back to in-person senior year, I was failing to keep up and found myself scoring poorly on major assessments. This was a big blow for me as someone who has always done well in school; I didn't know how to get out of this rut myself. After struggling for a while, I was finally able to open up to my parents and teachers to seek help and guidance. I had always been a very independent student growing up so I was not used to asking for help or communicating about my struggles. This experience taught me the importance of reaching out to others. Also, I learned how to be realistic about my capabilities. I became more introspective. Now, I take the time to reflect on my strengths AND weaknesses, and do my best to hold myself accountable to improving areas of weakness. I have gotten better at knowing myself and my skillset.",
            "Question 9": "In my senior year (21-22) as Model UN Director General of our high school club, I directed a high school Model UN conference for 19+ schools across the DFW-metroplex with 200+ delegates attending. After being in Model UN throughout high school, this opportunity felt like my way to give back to the organization that had taught me so much in the past 4 years. Though this was a intensive 6-month project, I thoroughly enjoyed working alongside my fellow MUN veterans / secretariat as we strived to not only simply put on an event, but to create a cultured experience, fond memory, and stepping stone that would instill a passion for debate for the future generation of MUNers! I am especially proud of putting together this in-person conference after an entirely virtual school year because the pandemic lockdown had caused many high school Model UN clubs across my hometown region (DFW) to sadly die out entirely. Through this conference, I got into contact with high schools across the region and guided numerous club advisors through reviving their school's own MUN organization. This conference became a catered experience to first-time MUNers that I can only hope kickstarted their delegating journey!"

            "Question 7": "Having a representative voice as an engineering student is important because it ensures that the concerns and needs of the student body are being heard and addressed by the university. This allows for a more positive and productive learning environment, as well as a more responsive and effective program. Without a representative voice, students may not feel heard or acknowledged and may not have the opportunity to provide feedback or express their needs. Additionally, a representative voice can also help to promote and advocate for the needs of engineering students to external stakeholders, such as potential employers and government officials. Representation also helps to promote diversity and inclusivity within the engineering field, as different perspectives and experiences can be shared and considered when making decisions that affect the student body. Overall, a representative voice is essential for ensuring the success and growth of engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "When I first moved to college station, I struggled to make new friends. I felt shy and unsure of how to approach others and often found myself feeling left out of social events and activities. This experience was difficult and isolating, but it ultimately helped me to grow and learn important lessons about communication and self-esteem. One of the most important things I learned is the importance of being more vocal and outgoing. I realized that I needed to put myself out there more and take initiative in social situations. This meant actively seeking out opportunities to meet new people, whether it was through joining clubs or organizations, attending events on campus, or simply striking up conversations with my classmates. At the same time, I also learned the importance of respecting others' boundaries and my own. I came to understand that not everyone is comfortable with the same level of social interaction and that it's important to be aware of and sensitive to this fact. I now try to be mindful of how others are responding to my attempts to connect and adjust my approach accordingly.",
            "Question 9": "I enjoy working with my research team at MIDL Labs because the team dynamic is very collaborative and supportive. We all have different strengths and areas of expertise, and we work well together to combine our knowledge and skills to achieve our research goals. The professors and upperclassmen on the team continue to teach and guide me, but they also give me the opportunity to shine and try out new ideas. I feel like my contributions are valued, and I am given the freedom to experiment and explore different avenues of research. This allows me to develop my skills and confidence as a researcher. The team is also very open to new ideas and perspectives, and I appreciate the diverse backgrounds and experiences of my team members. This allows us to approach problems from different angles and come up with innovative solutions. The team is always pushing me to learn more, and I feel like I am constantly growing and developing not only as a researcher but also as a teammate."

            "Question 7": "My experience with engineering started with a simple google search my sophomore year. Although I\u2019m glad for having found it and being able to speak with teachers and family about going into engineering as a career, I wish I had been introduced to engineering sooner. Recently my younger siblings attended SEC\u2019s EnVision event. While they were both hesitant at first, at the end of the day they spoke non-stop about the amazing activities they had done.\nEngineering awareness events, especially for younger kids, can help them explore their interests long before the pressure of deciding comes around. SEC\u2019s mission to spread awareness of the possibilities and applications of engineering is what I personally admire the most from their mission. Nowadays, high schoolers and younger seem to think of choosing a career path as a stressful responsibility looming around the corner. Simply giving them the chance to experience hands-on work in an exciting and no-loss environment can separate negative feelings that come with the future. SEC awareness events have benefits for all age groups and I think everyone should have the opportunity to experience engineering possibilities for themselves.",
            "Question 8": "In the past fall semester, I joined the Women in Engineering robotics team. There came a point in the semester when we began coding the movement for the robot, and although I had thought I understood the task, I found my mind blank staring at the computer. As a stubbornly independent learner, I sometimes have trouble asking other people for help. When I finally did admit I needed help, I was both relieved and frustrated at myself for wasting so much time.\nWhen it comes to a topic or skill I desperately want to grow in, I had created the mindset that asking for help meant I could never succeed by myself. I didn\u2019t realize that asking for help didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t handle it, but just that I couldn\u2019t handle it yet. Struggling with a topic doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not cut out to succeed. Instead, it helps me find different ways of thinking, in the end making me more capable of handling future obstacles.",
            "Question 9": "In my senior year of high school, I began volunteering at a local food bank for half a day every month. For 5 hours straight we would package, organize, and deliver food and supplies to those in need. I\u2019ll admit that at first, I was only there to meet my school\u2019s required service hour limit. It only took a couple of hours of talking to the people volunteering and those who came to receive help to realize how insignificant a couple of service hours seemed in comparison to the work I was doing. As people waited in line I would talk to them and get to hear a little snippet of their lives. And no matter how different each person was, they all greeted each other like old friends. I loved seeing someone pull up and immediately strike up a lively conversation with a volunteer like they had known them their whole life. After going a couple of times, I even started to recognize and be recognized by those who showed up. I know it\u2019s cliche, but those food drives were the highlight of my month."

            "Question 7": "The pillar that means the most to me is, fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students within the College of Engineering. This pillar stands out to me because throughout my freshman year, I had not found a passion that I could pursue, and make a career out of. I know that there are a lot of people who have the same experience freshman year, and it is important to figure out what you are interested in as early on in your college career as possible. The first, and most challenging part of professional advancement is figuring out what you want to do with your degree. I want to help people who are in the same boat as I was, to figure out what they are passionate about.",
            "Question 8": "During my first semester in college, I failed to meet my own academic expectations. Through this, I realized I had been failing myself in more ways than my academics. When I first got to college, I had a hard time adjusting to college life, and getting into a routine. Due to this I did not do as well in my classes as I had hoped. When midterm grades came back I had fallen behind pretty far in most of my classes. Instead of getting back in the saddle and improving my grades, I chose to beat myself up about letting my grades slip, so I wasn\u2019t able to improve them. Through this I realized that I had failed to set myself realistic goals, and failed to cut myself some slack when I didn\u2019t meet the high goals that I had set for myself.\nSince that semester, I have been better about setting achievable goals for myself, and not being too hard on myself if something doesn\u2019t go exactly as I had hoped. This has helped me to improve my grades, and realize that it is unrealistic to expect perfection, and be surprised when that expectation is not met.",
            "Question 9": "Over this past summer, I worked a job in customer service for a cell phone service provider company. Everyday I would deal with customers who were having issues with their phones, most of them being angry and frustrated when I first answered their call. I had the opportunity to help them with their problems, and to help them out of a difficult situation, where they felt they had no power.\nThis job gave me the opportunity to solve problems, and I was able to do so while also helping people. This job was the perfect mix of challenging, fun, and rewarding and that\u2019s why I loved it so much. My favorite part of the job was to get an angry customer on the line, and be able to help them out of their anger and frustration, and hear their reaction when I had helped them. I thoroughly enjoy helping people through tough times, and seeing or hearing their reaction once their issues are resolved. Working with people, and working to help people are the most rewarding, and most enjoyable types of work."

            "Question 7": "Although all three of these pillars are very important, the one that means the most to me is that the SEC works to increase engineering awareness through its programs and events. I first heard about the SEC when I attended the fall semester career fair in which I was pleasantly surprised to see so many big companies offering not only jobs but advice to current students. This event was very beneficial to me and many other students as I was able to get my first look into the \"real world\" career-wise. Events like this allow students to discover their interests and possibly find opportunities which could start their careers. Organizing events like the career fairs require a determined and responsible group of students. I would love to be a part of such a strong organization as it builds character upon important values and encourages leadership.",
            "Question 8": "A time that I failed at something was when I did not fulfill my deadline for the newspaper submission. Senior year of high school I was given the role of being editor in chief of my school newspaper. I enjoyed getting together interesting pieces and designing the newspaper but I did not realize how much work my new role as editor in chief required. I was given a deadline for when I had to get together everyone's stories and submit them to be published. When it was time for my first due date, I was not ready and I procrastinated getting the stories together and I was unable to do so on time. This taught me that as a leader, it was my responsibility to be more organized and communicate more effectively with the staff. From then on I made a goal of reaching out to everyone well before time and made sure the newspaper was submitted on time. This failure taught me many leadership skills along with teaching me to be more responsible and aware.",
            "Question 9": "In my four years of high school, each summer I worked a summer job as a lifeguard. Many people thought that it was a silly job to do for so long but I enjoyed working there for many reasons. Throughout my time there, I always loved my work environment and the people there but one specific time that stands out to me is when I saved a young boy. I had made quite a few saves at that point but I remember it so clearly because of what happened after getting him out of the water. After I got him out he gave me such a big hug and that hug just warmed my heart and made me realize how much I loved working there. Also, his dad came up to me and thanked me so passionately and then every time I saw them after that they would give me the biggest smile. I will always remember this as to when I made a stranger's day and met some very nice people. That day I truly realized my impact on these children and their families which allowed me to be more vigilant in my role as a lifeguard."

As a freshman, I had no clue of the countless opportunities that I was missing out on where I could have learnt valuable information about industry through professors or even people from the workforce themselves. Even for upperclassmen, it is very difficult to get an interview with any company without any help. However, SEC provides a variety of events like the career fair and DI Saturdays to help engineers find their way through college into the working world. It would be an honor to be a part of something as big as helping someone find their purpose in engineering and help them achieve it.",
            "Question 8": "During my internship work Steerwise Inc. last summer, I was tasked with managing a small project for one of the clients of the company, and I was so eager to show them that my employment there was worth it. So I told them we could finish the project within just 4 weeks. In my head, I thought I could get it done but it ended up taking longer than expected and they were not happy. Upon completing my internship, I realized I should have been more conservative in my time frame that I gave. The client was not going to be upset if I was just clear about the timeline in advance, but they were disappointed in my promise of something that I did not deliver. So I took this valuable lesson and applied it to become significantly better at managing the expectations of the people I work for. From then on, if there was anything I was tasked with, I would communicate a clear deadline so the work would be perfect and not rushed.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer, I was selected to be a part of the SEC directed internship program. In the short span of twelve weeks, I worked with an amazing team of engineers and professors to create our very own product that would be applied in the engineering industry. As an electrical engineer, it was a great opportunity to learn how to design a 3D model of a drone and a controller for it. Though the work was at times difficult, it was one of the most fun and rewarding experiences I have ever had. I made a lot of friends and I also established connections with professors in industry who taught me many useful lessons that could come in handy when I join the workforce. When it comes to tackling any sort of problem, I really enjoy working with a team because I get to see things from a different perspective and I also have the opportunity to make friends and network with them."

Engineering students will be fully equipped with the knowledge necessary to excel in a professional environment and produce meaningful work that makes an impact on those around us. The positive results of SEC's efforts in this regard have been unequivocal. Thanks to SEC, I have had the opportunity to speak to many companies at the career fair, gotten to know some of the recruiters, and even gotten asked to do an interview with a company for an internship. I believe all engineering students should already be looking towards a professional career, and we are fortunate that SEC assists us with this.",
            "Question 8": "One of my failures that stuck out to me was when I didn't tell my boss that I would be able to substitute the rest of the week at another YMCA location that needed additional staff. I just \"assumed\" that I was only needed to be a substitute for only one day, when she actually meant for the rest of the week. To make up for it, I tried to be more available and take additional shifts from other coworkers who were simply unable to make it to work. I would then always seek clarification for any instructions my supervisor gave me, no matter how straight forward it may seem. In other words, it is better to be safe than sorry, especially when you are an employee at a company. In addition to this, I learned to become more punctual due to the volatility of staff and number of swimmers we needed to teach in a particular day, so I would always be ready for whatever is thrown at me.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer when I worked as a YMCA swim lessons instructor , I would say I genuinely enjoyed what I did. Being a lifelong competitive swimmer myself, I was extremely passionate about swimming, and having the opportunity to share my knowledge with students was an opportunity I am grateful for. I taught kids as young as 3 years old who had never even put their face in the water, as well as adults who were wanting to sharpen up their swimming technique. This required creativity on my part, which was one of my favorite parts. Day after day I worked with each student all of which were progressing at different rates and slowly becoming closer to proficiency in the required skills. This was the difficult part, but seeing them make small improvements towards my end goal was what made me keep putting in passion. When the students finally were able to swim the strokes or perform certain skills that I had hoped to accomplish, I have to say I have never felt a more gratifying sensation. It made me feel like my teaching methods actually worked, and I helped a person gain a potentially life saving skill."

As engineering students, a large portion of our curriculum focuses on technical skills and knowledge. For most engineering majors, only a technical writing class is required on top of the university core curriculum. Many engineering students are left without the necessary professional writing skills, interviewing techniques, and confidence to enter today's competitive job market.

            "Question 8": "In highschool I was a member of the Pocock Rowing Center in Seattle, Washington. As a Junior, I was finally able to try out for travel teams. The first big away race of the year was in Boston, and in order to be competitive I spent extra time after practice lifting weights and started cross training on the weekends. I was doing anything I could just to gain an advantage. I did this for one month until selection week arrived. I eventually got dropped from the team on the last day after losing a practice race. As upset as I was that I didn\u2019t make the team, I learned two very important lessons. First, In order to be successful you must act with purpose. I fell short because I was simply doing anything I could to workout, as opposed to focusing on exercises that would have increased my fitness as a rower. Second, I learned the importance of a plan. Having a plan makes it very easy to keep everyone accountable and give a clear path for improvement. I think that if I had implemented these lessons before beginning my selection preparations, I would have likely made the team.",

Out of the three main areas of the SEC's mission, being the representative voice of all engineering students is the most crucial. Representation ensures that the needs and concerns of engineering students are heard and addressed by relevant authorities. A representative voice also fosters a sense of community and belonging among students, promoting collaboration and cooperation. The SEC's role as a representative voice is essential for ensuring that the SEC can effectively achieve its mission and serve the needs of engineering students. It provides a platform for representation, support and growth, creating a positive and inclusive environment for all engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "My first semester in college was a challenge. Despite putting in my best effort, I barely passed my classes and felt like a complete failure. However, that feeling was short-lived. My diagnosis of ADHD was a turning point. I realized that with the right tools and support, I could achieve success. I sought treatment, such as finding the right medication and working with a counselor, and developed a plan for academic success that included working with an academic advisor and establishing a solid study routine. In addition, I made self-care a priority, incorporating exercise and taking time for myself when needed. These changes allowed me to turn my college experience around and succeed. I learned that failure is not the end, but an opportunity to grow and improve. Through my struggles, I developed resilience and discovered my own potential, and now I am determined to make the most of it. With hard work and perseverance, I know that anything is possible.",
            "Question 9": "Working as a Physical Therapy Technician (PT Tech) in high school was a unique opportunity. Each day, I assisted Physical Therapists in providing therapy to patients with injuries and disabilities. I saw their progress and was a part of their journey towards recovery.\nBeing a PT Tech allowed me to learn about anatomy and physical therapy techniques. I worked with experienced Physical Therapists and learned from their expertise, gaining a deeper understanding of the human body and how to support patients.\nOne summer, I worked with a patient who struggled with a serious injury and mobility. I supported and encouraged him throughout his therapy and was overjoyed when he returned to his normal activities. This experience reinforced the importance of my work and the impact I could have on someone's life.\nWorking as a PT Tech in high school was a life-changing experience. It taught me the value of helping others and the fulfillment that comes from making a difference. It was a privilege to be a part of my patients' recovery and improve their quality of life."

Ultimately, the vast majority of students will seek to join the engineering workforce in various industries and positions, making this mission ever important. Equipping students with both knowledge and experience surrounding professional engineering industries provides a meaningful education that transcends the classroom and sets A&M students apart from their counterparts. The SEC does an excellent job of shedding light on new ways for engineering students to apply their degrees to the real world through events every semester. Personally, I was amazed simply by attending the Career Fair and interacting with some of the companies that attended, and getting to speak with the representatives illuminated that I can apply an engineering education to virtually any field.",
            "Question 8": "As a high school senior, I was tasked with designing, performing, and analyzing my own physics experiment from start to finish. Initially, I was confident and without giving it much thought, I decided to explore the relationship between refractive index and salinity, which entailed shining a laser through saline water. Countless hours were spent in a dark bathroom while trying to be as precise as possible in collecting my over 200 data points by hand. But upon analyzing the data, there was no trend, I didn\u2019t realize a flat line on a graph could be so frightening. After 4 rounds of re-entering the data, I was forced to accept that my experiment failed. Time was not on my side and I had to go on with my report. While I was disappointed that my experiment failed, I was still confident in my unique idea and effort. Ultimately, my teacher rewarded my effort and originality. This experience exemplified the need for balance. Balance in instinct versus planning, balance in time management, and overall balance of perspective. Moving forward, I\u2019m able to reflect on and think critically about my decisions, allowing me to combine creativity and planning in my choices and actions.",
            "Question 9": "Work is a word that, for many, brings with it memories of endless hours spent doing tedious and difficult tasks, which is why I was less than enthusiastic when I realized that the symposium I was selected for was more than just a trip to Belgium. To my dismay, my team of six would have to meet every Wednesday, to do just that: work. However, I quickly began looking forward to our meetings each week. They became a space to collaborate and discuss ideas in tandem with our required prep work. Whether it be a crash course in French or group research about the local culture, it was always full of excitement and interest, because we knew we would be able to explore the real-world aspect of the work and effort we put in. I enjoyed the responsibility and connection I felt to the work, it was in my hands, and I got to explore on my own in addition to having a group of peers I could come to as well. Additionally, I had a clear and tangible goal to work towards, a goal I truly wanted to achieve, which gave me not only academic motivation but personal interest."

            "Question 8": "In high school robotics, I failed my first time as a project manager. Overly ambitious, I convinced our team to build a complex drive system for our robot called \"Differential Swerve Drive.\" Caught up in making my designs stand out to the judges and the other teams, I refused to drop it and focused most of the team\u2019s time and finances into it. We realized too close to competition that our drivetrain wasn\u2019t ready and had to ditch it at the last minute. The team almost didn\u2019t have a drivable robot and didn\u2019t make it past the regional level of competition, while other robotics teams at our school did.\nI analyzed the last season, and realized that I didn\u2019t distribute my team\u2019s resources effectively, and hyper fixated on one component. Next season, I ensured we made design choices that were feasible for our time frame, and distributed tasks based on priority for core functionality. These changes notably impacted the robot\u2019s performance because it supplied time to perfect the design. My team qualified for the world competition and won all design awards. Because of these tangible results, I now employ my robot design strategies in any team project I'm involved in.",
            "Question 9": "A time I really enjoyed doing work was when I built a gauntlet that shoots flames. The gauntlet shoots six foot flames and can tase someone upon contact.\nIt\u2019s rewarding for me to experience the full design process, because I get to bring a product to life from virtual CAD designs. I believe constraints foster creative solutions and I\u2019ve had to meet some strict ones such as paying out of my own pocket, working in my apartment, and having to scrounge my own materials. I\u2019ve found making trips to the junkyard can actually be exciting, when I find cheap parts needed for my projects. Another great part of working on these projects is that I can constantly improve them to my liking. I have several iterations of this project, as I want to challenge myself to make the design look better visually, operate more reliably, and improve safety. While I have put a lot of physical effort into this project, the way it stimulates my problem solving skills and silliness of the project makes it not feel like work at all."

            "Question 8": "In my previous internship, I was tasked with creating a plan to help effectively budget time to hit various milestones through the course of a project. I was confident in my ability to create an effective plan and was sure that it would be successful. However, when it came time to implement it, I had realized that I had misinterpreted an expectation that was communicated to me.

I felt like a failure and was convinced that I had wasted all of my time and energy on this project. However, as I took a step back and looked at the situation objectively, I realized that my failure was an opportunity for growth. I began to analyze what went wrong with my design and why the plan was so unreliable.\nThrough this experience, I learned that the key to success is not always the first solution that comes to mind. I discovered the importance of being open to new ideas, seeking input from others, and continuously iterating on my project plans. I also learned to be strong in the face of failure and to not give up.",
            "Question 9": "As a young child I struggled with confidently answering math questions. This is when my distaste towards being tutored revealed itself. After failed attempts at finding the \u201cperfect\u201d tutor I decided to independently learn tricks to grow my skills and confidence in the study.\nDuring the peak of the pandemic, I had the opportunity to do what no tutor ever did for me. A group of senior high school students approached me asking if I could help them with calculus as online learning proved to be difficult. This was my chance to make math fun by proving time consuming and intricate formulas are not as intimidating as you think.\nSeeing the students I tutored progress and gain confidence in their abilities was incredibly rewarding. I connected with them on a personal level and helped them see the relevance of their education in the real world.\nMy most memorable moment was when one of my students approached me with a problem they spent hours struggling on. Helping them achieve that \u201caha\u201d moment was priceless. It is the reason why I continue to enjoy tutoring."

It wasn\u2019t until I joined Science Olympiad in high school that I was introduced to material science and discovered I could combine my passion of chemistry with the real-world applications of engineering.\nI was so excited when I learned about material science but I wouldn\u2019t have known about it without the club introducing me in the first place. I want to be able to replicate this initial excitement with so many more people. People who maybe have considered engineering but weren\u2019t sure which one to specialize in. Or even people who\u2019ve never considered it in the first place. With engineering having limitless possibilities, there\u2019s always something for everybody.",
            "Question 8": "Failure, for me, is when you are unable to acknowledge when it\u2019s time to take a step back and reconsider the possibilities in front of you in order to properly choose a course of action.\nWhen I was in high school, I ran track and field and after winning some early races, my senior year was looking to be one of my best seasons yet.\nHowever, halfway through the season, I began feeling some slight shin pain, likely early shin splits. It can be caught early on, and with enough rest, will fully heal in a few weeks. However, with the regional meet closing in, and my season going great, I ignored my body and kept pushing which resulted in a late-season injury and a lackluster performance at the regional meet.\nIn hindsight, it was likely a smarter move to take the couple rest days instead of trying to brute force my way through the rest of the season. However, this has taught me to be more conscious of different alternatives instead of simply tunneling on a specific course of action. As a result, I\u2019ve become more patient in my decision-making and been able to consider how my actions have longer term effects.",
            "Question 9": "My favorite long-term project I\u2019ve enjoyed working on has been learning Japanese.\nI started studying summer after senior year hoping to take the placement exam at the end of the year in order to test out of Japanese 101/102, as sections for classes had filled up. For a non-native speaker with only a few months of experience, it was a daunting challenge to pass an exam designed for native Japanese speakers.\nLooking back, I realize I learned much more than Japanese.\nI learned that true progress doesn\u2019t come in a few days or even a few weeks. Nor does it come through cramming information the night before. It comes from consistently sitting down and working on the little things each and every day. Because even if it seems insignificant or unnoticeable, these little things add up each day to help you reach a goal you never imagined was possible. For me, this was the most satisfying part about learning a new language: Being able to look at your past self and see how much you\u2019ve grown through your own hard work and dedication.\nIt's thanks to this drive that I managed to pass the exam and accept credit for 101/102."

            "Question 8": "Participating in the SEC Directed Internship challenged me to adapt and recover from failure after a month of progress. In my group, I was in charge of organizing weekly meetings and formulating a two month plan. To quickly make progress, I naively pushed the group to make a premature decision on our solution and problem statement. As a result, we ran with the first idea that sounded decent. However, because our idea was not fully fleshed out, the root of the problem was disconnected from our proposed solution. Realizing that we were going down the wrong path, I held a meeting with my team and took responsibility for the lack of attention during the planning process. To get back on track, I knew we had to scrap weeks of work and pivot to a new idea. After this incident, I took extra care in taking things slow to prevent any oversights in all other phases of our project which led to a successful solution and final presentation. Beyond the scope of the internship, I continue to maintain a detailed oriented mindset and fix mistakes quickly.",
            "Question 9": "As a leader and educator, I found myself valuing the growing interests of the aspiring engineers and supporting their ability to think critically and individually. In my time at Lavner, a STEM summer camp, I was fortunate to be in a position where such concepts and activities were commonplace. I was able to experience a diverse range of perspectives from fields in web design and game development to 3D printing and robotics. However, with new perspectives also came new challenges. Ones that I would be pleasantly grateful for. One of the most prominent and meaningful obstacles I came across was discovering the numerous methods of which students may approach and digest information. For some it involved hands-on and collaborative demonstration, others more visual, and a few playful analogies. Without this unique experience at Lavner, my skills and character would not be nearly as adaptive as I am today."

My depression had been so debilitating that I had less than a 70 on 3/5 of my classes. I felt like a huge disappointment and I was so ashamed that I hid my grades from my parents. However, I didn't let this depression take over me, eventually I overcame it and used it as an opportunity to become a better version of myself. With the help of a therapist, I began to focus on self-care and took steps to manage my depression. I began to practice mindfulness and meditation. I also made sure to stay connected with my friends and family so I wasn\u2019t as lonely.

From my experience, more often than not, engineering students come from all walks of life, with engineering being their pathway to not only a better future but a more sustainable and secure one. Despite the benefits of this pathway, engineers often suffer in silence while dealing with various problems from workplace hazards, forced job transitions, or the ever-recurring school vs. work phenomena, where new engineering soon realize the differences between the classroom and the work environment. Despite these issues, engineers persevere through these problems silently and alone, lacking a way to communicate their issues to an experienced mentor or even a caring representative. Instead, choosing to stay quiet and push through to reach the idealistic end goal of most engineers, making communication and representation of the utmost importance for companies and other engineers to not only resolve the issues but identify them in the first place.",
            "Question 8": "In my senior year of high school, I got the opportunity to work with Houston Methodist; my experience there was one filled with knowledge, and under my mentor, Homer Quintana, I was able to start on a project close to my heart, diagnosing and treating chemo-brain, or cognitive dysfunction as a result of cancer. This issue impacted my grandfather, and as a result, the goal of the internship was to create some form of treatment with the resources at my disposal. While the initial development and beta testing phase went smoothly, after having a base algorithm and researching other options on the market, I ran into numerous technological, fiscal, and logistical barriers as a 17-year-old high school student. However, after angel funding discussions and more knowledge from my mentor, I started my nonprofit, Atlas Diagnostics, and developed an app and accompanying website to inform cancer patients about the problem of chemo-brain and treatment. I grew first by gaining practical app development experience that, combined with Methodist's persistent mindset, will help me in the business world. Second, I gained valuable teamwork and leadership skills, worked with my mentor, and successfully managed and oversaw the development of my app, transforming a failing project into a profitable business venture.",
            "Question 9": "As the sun rapidly rose to create an unbearable, sapping heat, my sweat-soaked shirt clung to my chest. I loudly protested to my parents, letting them know my discomfort, and took in the trays of food along with my equally tired, sweaty family. The importance of what we were doing never occurred to me. Instead, I was more focused on how my phone had died and how I wished I could run away from this orphanage in India and return to the air-conditioned SUV. However, in an instant, everything changed as the bell tolled inside the yard for lunch, and hundreds of little orphans sprung from their school rooms and raced downstairs to get their first meal. As I saw their faces light up in response to something as simple as food, all of my troubles seemed insignificant. Not only that but as I watched my father looking at his generous handiwork, a feeling of pride filled my chest as I began to take care in serving the younger kids. However, I had harsh thoughts, yet this time of shame and regret, as not 5 minutes earlier, I complained about my \"dire situation\" and how it affected me. I finally understood my parent's constant correction now more than ever: to look for things outside of those that affect myself and focus on the greater good of others. This self-realization led me to various visits after that to those children and caused me to reframe how I was as a person despite being so young. This realization is also part of the reason as to why I chose the field of engineering as it blossomed a passion in younger me to create technology to not only help other but fuel these little joys in our lives."

            "Question 8": "I define failure as times when I don't meet my goals with the resources I have been allotted. Instances of this include times when I didn't get a certain grade, to not completing the tasks I have listed on my daily to-do list. Most recently, I failed in getting certain things done in the time I allotted for them to be completed. This is not an issue of getting things done by the due date, but an issue of completing them when I say I am going to. I have been aware of this issue and have worked to solve it by removing distractions during times of work. I usually take action by putting my phone in a different room and having what I want to get done in front of me in order of priority. I have found that writing things down leads to much more efficiency than telling yourself that you are going to get something done. Having accountability is vital as it is truly you against yourself.

            "Question 9": "Until recently, I had never coded for leisure or with the purpose to build a personal project. This all changed when I competed in TAMU Hack last semester. I formed a team with four friends and was excited to code over the weekend. Our goal was to create a group travel website with a clean user interface and a somewhat functioning backend. I was put to work on the frontend of the website along with a friend, while the rest worked on the backend of the website in order to ensure proper functionality. The end outcome was just as we envisioned it, but the process to get there is what I enjoyed the most. I was able to collaborate with like minded people and learn so much in a short amount of time. It was the first time some of us used languages like JavaScript or NodeJS, but it was exciting to learn and bounce ideas off each other. I found that working in a group is something I enjoy, and is most likely why I didn't enjoy programing initially. Since then I have gone to complete a certification in Python and am currently working on a Web Development certification."

Ever since I came into contact with my first professional mentor, I have seen many opportunities and have advanced my knowledge and network tenfold. Fostering professional advancements will help engineers build a more extensive network and gain people skills that can yield new opportunities and a stronger foundation for personal success. Having a group of individuals who have these professional skills and can help you understand what is required to take the next step in your career is both priceless and necessary. Furthermore, being in a peer mentorship society such as the SEC has even more beneficial potential. Not only are you around people who have already taken that next step but these same people can relate to you on a more personal level because they understand almost exactly what you are going through.",
            "Question 8": "For the last 11 years, I have been a pitcher. During my sophomore year of high school, I had incredible success. As my success continued, I had become arrogant. One week, I was set to start in a critical game but couldn\u2019t throw a strike if my life depended on it. I was so bad that I got pulled out of the game before the first inning ended. I sat in the dugout and on the car ride home frustrated, embarrassed, and thinking. In hindsight, I didn\u2019t take that week\u2019s practice very seriously, I didn\u2019t stretch properly before the game, and I wasn\u2019t mentally ready to play. I was angry. I came to practice next week with new goals. I flew around the field, took every pitch seriously, and sure enough next week I was back to striking out the side. I\u2019ve applied this lesson of remaining humble and staying hungry to all aspects of my life. I\u2019ve learned to enjoy success and let it build me up but understand that there is always more to be done. In the words of Winston Churchill, \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal- it\u2019s the courage to continue that counts.\u201d",
            "Question 9": "Growing up, my dad would have me help him do projects around the house and for the longest time I wasn\u2019t a fan. However, two years ago my parents tasked me with tearing down and rebuilding the mantle in our living room. I\u2019m not really sure why but something just clicked and I was excited for this project. Right away I planned in detail how I was going to remove the current mantle without damaging the structure around it. Soon after I planned how I would rebuild the fireplace, ensuring that my work wouldn\u2019t fall apart from the test of time. My creativity and craftsmanship were through the roof. I got to work with the actual mantle and acted with extreme caution to make sure I didn\u2019t damage anything unnecessary. Once I got to rebuilding, I went through the painstaking process and making perfect cuts and taking my time to check that very detail I planned for was present. By the end of the project I had turned our homes boring, outdated mantle into an intrinsic piece of art. My enjoyment of the work I was doing showed through the thorough detail-oriented process and beautiful piece I had produced."

By becoming a member of SEC I believe I will represent and help other women like me realize that they do not have to shy away from engineering, but rather feel a sense of belonging within the engineering community at TAMU. At first I was very intimidated by the engineering community and hesitant to become involved, but the connections and mentorship I found in engineering helped me realize that I found my place. I want to help fellow students find their place in this engineering community that has offered me amazing resources, connections, and new ways of problem-solving that I never thought possible.",
            "Question 8": "Growing up I was always the fastest girl at long-distance track, and I never doubted my confidence or abilities. Entering high school I tried out for the varsity level cross country team, and I was 100% confident that I would secure a varsity spot. I was utterly devastated when I finished below the top 7 girls. I was placed on the JV team and felt like a complete failure. My worth was tied to how well I performed and being on a lower team completely shattered my confidence. Instead of wallowing in despair, I chose to train harder until I ultimately finished in the top 4 runners at the state level. This taught me that a setback is not a failure and does not mean I cannot work hard and still complete that ultimate goal. I believe that feeling like I failed taught me that things won't be handed to me in life, and that it is more fulfilling when I put in effort to complete a goal. Now, I have grown to see this experience as an obstacle I was able to overcome and make me stronger mentally rather than a failure that defined me.",
            "Question 9": "Although it might sound odd for someone to look forward to a seemingly monotonous job, to me lifeguarding was a source of fulfillment. Lifeguarding was a time when I got to communicate with hundreds of new people and taught me invaluable knowledge for task management. I enjoyed getting to measure pool samples each morning, taking the trash out, and having to clean the bottom of the pool. Hard work provided me with a sense of accomplishment because seeing the success of seeing my hard work pay off each morning when local residents were able to enjoy the clean and relaxing pool environment. Managing others may seem appealing on the surface level, actually doing the work and manual labor myself provided me with a deeper sense of satisfaction. In this way, working as a lifeguard at the local pools helped me feel connected to my community because the work I did gave me a real sense of purpose to the people around me compared to just managing and telling others what work to do."

Throughout my life, I have consistently taken on leadership roles and strived to make a positive impact on those around me. From serving as the president of my high school's National Honor Society to captaining the Varsity Soccer team, I am always searching for opportunities to influence and inspire others. Joining the SEC offers me a chance to not only improve my skills and knowledge within the field of engineering but also to make a difference in the lives of my fellow students.

            "Question 8": "When I was in 10th grade, I was invited by my science teacher to join the UIL Academic team. My confidence was high, and I thought that I could perform well without proper preparation. Unfortunately, this proved to be a mistake, as I didn't place in any of the events I participated in and had to apologize to my teacher for wasting her time. Determined to do better, I spent the next year studying and practicing for the next competition. The hard work paid off, as I placed in both science and math, and I qualified for regionals. My senior year, I took on the role of president for the UIL Academic team, and used my experiences to guide and encourage new members to avoid making the same mistakes that I had made. Because of this, I learned the importance of keeping my ego in check and preparing thoroughly for any endeavor. I now apply this lesson to every aspect of my life, whether academic or athletic, as I believe it is crucial to being the best version of myself. Through failure I was taught the value of humility, hard work, and dedication in achieving success.",
            "Question 9": "Being a soccer referee was the perfect job for me as a high school student. Regardless of the pay, I was able to make a network of friends doing something that I truly enjoyed. Not only that, but I was able to make an impact on kids younger than me and teach them something that had drastically changed my life. Sure, being heckled by coaches and jeered by parents isn\u2019t always what you want to have happen to you at 8 am, but knowing that the alternative would be working the cash register at a fast food restaurant made these annoyances feel trivial. Also, to be able to immediately see the consequences of my actions was an exhilarating experience. When half the crowd of around 100 emotional spectators disagrees with every decision you make, you learn to both be confident in yourself and also know when to accept fault when one of your fellow referees corrects your call. The pressure of protecting players and making quick, decisive calls that came with this job molded me into a better person, and I owe a good part of who I am today to the responsibility that being a referee gave to me."

Thus, I appreciate the professional advancement programs that SEC puts on, like career fair and industry night; they give students a glimpse into what the engineering industry looks like and how to prepare for it. And while thinking about my future is sometimes stressful, I have always enjoyed helping people explore new hobbies and find their passions. As a peer mentor in high school, I helped my mentee get involved in extracurriculars and classes that complemented her interests and plans for college. Now, I\u2019d love to help my peers discover which fields they\u2019d like to enter and develop networks that will make the transition from college to the workforce easier.",
            "Question 8": "In high school, I served as the senior class coordinator for my school\u2019s Key Club. I was responsible for organizing service projects and managing my class\u2019 involvement. For one smaller event, I was able to ask a few friends specifically to sign up, rather than the whole club. When the event came around, one person didn\u2019t show up or inform me that they wouldn\u2019t be there. I was aggravated and hurt, so I sent them a frustrated text without considering my tone. They were upset by my response because events in their personal life had caused them to miss the project.\nLater, I invited them to catch up and discuss the situation. I acknowledged that I should have waited until I had my thoughts gathered to talk to them and how, regardless of our friendship, I should\u2019ve acted more professionally as an officer. The experience taught me that leaders must be firm and maintain expectations, but also remain calm and understanding. Since then, I have made sure to understand the reasons behind people\u2019s actions before making assumptions, and to check on the people I\u2019m working with and ensure they are still comfortable with their responsibilities.",
            "Question 9": "After several years of swimming for my club team, I decided to become an instructor for their summer swim lessons program. I taught toddlers all the way up to teenagers and worked with a variety of skill and comfort levels. Some of my kids were terrified of the water, while others had been doing lessons for years and hoped to join the novice team. I was responsible for determining where my kids were starting out and helping them reach their goals. My job wasn\u2019t very difficult, but it was exhausting - I could count on getting hit or having my hair pulled multiple times a day. Still, it was incredibly rewarding. I enjoyed inventing ways of improving my kids\u2019 technique, and seeing them finally work on the twentieth try. I loved watching them progress from fear and uncertainty to confidence and even excitement about swimming. That fall, I became a novice division coach for my team and saw some of my kids advance even further. Coaching was an amazing first job experience - it taught me patience, persistence, and creativity, and allowed me to give back to my team and community."

            "Question 8": "Accepting failure never comes easy but if turned into a positive, can be a growing experience. During my junior year of high school, my partner and I won district and qualified for 6A tennis regionals in girls doubles. Although I knew the competition would be tough, my teammate and I worked for weeks preparing for the tournament and found ourselves ready to compete. During the second match, things went south and we started to lose. Although doubles is a team effort, my partner was playing her best tennis and I could not get a ball over the net. We eventually lost due to my shortcomings and I felt as though I had let her down. This failure affected me for days until I realized that this could be a learning opportunity. I decided to devote myself to working harder and be able to perform better the following year. Failing in that tennis match allowed me to recognize the power of the ability to learn from failure in a positive way, instituting an effective strategy to handle failure constructively in the future.",
            "Question 9": "A time I found myself enjoying work was this past summer, working as a camp counselor at a Christian youth camp. Being able to work alongside people with the same motive of helping young girls grow in their faith was fulfilling and made me feel like I was making an impact. For four weeks in June, I would care for and guide a cabin of 14 girls, taking them to fun activities and teaching them about the Gospel. I enjoyed this work because I was blessed with the best coworkers, making a difference in sweet and impressionable girls' lives over the course of a month. My coworkers stood out because of their devotion to making an impact on future generations of children in a safe environment. Combined with making an impact, being surrounded by gracious and devoted coworkers with the same intentions as me made my work more enjoyable and effective. I believe enjoying work is vital to making a difference because you are able to be fully present, which is why I am forever thankful to have had the opportunity to experience a positive working environment this past summer."

We are given a year to consider all the different majors yet many people are still unsure of what they want to do. Events such as DI Saturday and Industry Night have helped me and many others to consider what it is that each major actually does and how our interests coincide with certain areas of study. However, I think there is a certain, expected preoccupation with learning engineering through coursework. Having a career fair puts things into focus as it helps us understand the real-world applications of our work. The fair along with the associated events is a great asset when it comes to choosing our future careers.",
            "Question 8": "I was involved in Boy Scouts and was active in my troop. I managed to work my way up to Senior Patrol Leader and went on campouts every month. I had completed my requirements up till Life Scout and was well on my way to Eagle until the pandemic hit. During that time, I started participating less and less. It was about a month before the 18th birthday deadline before I realized that I still needed to get Eagle. I worked with the different merit badge counselors and planned my service project. It was a frantic last push but I managed to finish all my requirements 5 days before my 18th birthday.

This was the first time that I was really able to see how all the different CS concepts I\u2019d learned worked together in order to create a tangible object. After finishing, I wanted to expand my project which was when I found out about the game Absurdle. Through designing my implementation, I expanded upon my original work with the new constraints added. It was fun reading the explanation for the rules of the game and trying to figure out how I could make it work through code.

Although I am only in my second semester of college, I have both seen and experienced thinking I am not good enough to make it in this program on the basis of self doubt. The SEC does an amazing job providing a broad spectrum of resources, reminding students that there is more than one path an engineer can take.

            "Question 8": "Calculus is hard. The first time I took this course, I was a year younger than my peers so I already felt out of place. Once we started learning the curriculum this feeling was only amplified and I quickly began to fall behind. Resultantly, I got a 34% on the first test. Now was I bad at calculus? Perhaps. But because I went into that class with a negative mindset, I came out with negative results. This woke me up and I resultantly reworked my entire approach to the class. I started getting help and focused less on comparing myself to my peers. That experience showed me how much a mindset can have an impact on the work created. Through the SEC\u2019s Envision Conference, I want to show the younger generation that while engineering may seem hard or challenging, sometimes it just takes a different attitude to solve an issue. Now this isn\u2019t always the case, but by persevering through challenges at such a young age teaches a tough mindset and to not get discouraged so easily. Overall, a positive mindset is what creates positive results and I want to help foster that in the younger generation through the SEC.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer I worked as a swim instructor. This meant having about eight, 30 minute sessions in a day and working with kids all under the age of ten. Working with children and knowing I\u2019m making a large impact on their lives was an amazing feeling but trying to reason with them could often be a daunting task. When I first started, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same, but I didn\u2019t realize just how different each child would need to be taught in order to really break through to them. As the summer went on I got much better at learning how to communicate with different children that understand different things. Now I\u2019ve never been a competitive swimmer so the learning curve for this position was exponential, but the most enjoyable part of this job was exactly that. Work that is difficult to initially get a grasp on makes the results so much more satisfying. I enjoy solving problems which is exactly why I want to join the SEC. I want to use this organization to promote the positivity that comes with problem solving as well as make a positive impact on the engineering community."

            "Question 8": "I naively signed up for AP Computer Science as for my freshman year in high school. Once we hit the core of the course material in early October, I started struggling. Having never coded before, I wasn\u2019t picking up on the material quickly, and because I was concurrently adjusting to high school classes and extracurriculars, I didn\u2019t make the time to catch up on confusing concepts.\nIn early November, I got a 50 on a quiz. My teacher gave a requiz with the exact same structure as the first, but even after studying for the quiz, I got another 50. I stumbled through the next few weeks of computer science without paying much attention anymore, because I felt that my work wasn\u2019t paying off.\nOver winter break, I decided to give the class another shot, going through every single powerpoint, homework assignment, and practice problem again. After working hard all spring semester, I ended up earning a 5 on my AP exam. This class pushed me to maintain this attitude and pull myself back up, and whenever I encounter failure now, I remind myself that I can overcome anything as long as I put in the time and effort.",

I take a deep breath, and open my eyes.\nA room full of elementary schoolers stares back at me, because SciNOW is in session.\nSciNOW is a club where high schoolers teach kids about science using engaging presentations and experiments. As I began that first presentation, I noticed their excitement mirroring my own. I spent hours working on experiments, games, and presentations, and energized even the most skeptical, indifferent kids to get involved.\nWhen the pandemic hit, our in-person, interaction-based club was hit hard. By bringing ideas to restructure the club, I became president my senior year, and pushed to expand the program to all 13 district elementary schools and launch a virtual platform. I communicated with parents, teachers, and principals and held information sessions for our volunteers on how to effectively engage the kids. My role in SciNOW was ultimately to teach the kids about science. But in doing so, I learned from them too. Watching the kids get excited about science was the highlight of my week, and I grew as an individual and a leader through this experience."

Over time I had to learn to accept what is outside of my control; this was a very valuable lesson which has helped me prepare for unforeseen circumstances by focusing on what I can control, and has helped me stay level-headed when those circumstances arose. Essentially, this experience taught me to accept what will be and how to cope with the resulting anxiety.",
            "Question 9": "I will preface this by saying I have always enjoyed doing complex math, and am a year ahead of most other engineers in the subject as I am in differential equations as a freshman. Despite being \"ahead of the curve\", I will admit my work is not pretty; my handwriting degrades the longer I spend on something, and I often spend entirely too much time fixated on difficult problems, but the rewarding feeling of understanding a problem and winning against the complexities and miniscule details that antagonized me is well worth the time and effort I spent trying. However, this is not to say I don't enjoy the process. I enjoy things such as tedious derivations that most despise because I like to know how things work, and I often will take the time to get to know the reasons behind practical concepts we generally take for granted. In my opinion, my work does not look good or enjoyable, but it is something I find my own solace in, and achieving the purpose I set out for nullifies whatever obstacles I have experienced along the way."

            "Question 7": "I personally believe that the representation of the voice of engineering students to Texas A&M leadership is the most important pillar of the SEC. In a student body as large as the college of engineering, it can be difficult to feel heard by those in positions of power. The SEC gives these students a voice. Through initiatives such as the Engineering Student Survey, and the availability of SEC members, the counsel does an excellent job of giving engineering students the opportunity to make their opinions heard in ways otherwise impossible. It\u2019s encouraging to hear the knowledge that the feedback I submitted in the survey will someday reach the ears of Dean Hurtado. I am comforted by the knowledge that the counsel representing me is made of students just like me.",
            "Question 8": "Once senior year of high school hit and everyone around me was spending their days writing and rewriting essays for their dream college, I slacked off and presented half-baked applications to every university. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t make it into very many places and the schools I did make it into I didn\u2019t particularly want to go to. I was devastated as this was the first time my laziness had significantly impacted my future, and I decided to turn things around. I sat down and wrote down what I valued in life, what I hoped to get out of my future, and how to get there. I established that my primary goal of going to college was to graduate with a good job, and I began working on ways to improve my odds of succeeding. I went to the A&M Engineering Academy my freshman year to eventually get here, focused on my professional development, and have been able to get internships every year of college so far, all thanks to this pivotal moment.",
            "Question 9": "I\u2019ve been in Gents for 3 semester now, and have recently received the opportunity to assemble a presentation on professional development. My experience as a Chevron intern and in my current job as a student technician have given me an insightful look into the realities of professional life. This presentation then led to sitting down one-on-one withf friends to help them in their career planning. In one instance I was able to help a friend restructure her resume to use at the SEC career fair, which she was able to leverage into an interview and eventually an offer. Passing along the knowledge I gained was wonderfully rewarding, and although it wasn\u2019t the most technical task I have undertaken it was an incredible experience. I enjoyed the work not because it would help progress my career or get me better pay- I did it because it helped the people I care about. This experience has led me towards becoming the Gents professional development officer next year. I aim to use this drive to benefit SEC members directly with experience and connections by increasing opportunities for company-to-staff event planning along with helping the college of Engineering."

            "Question 7": "I believe that these three pillars come together to truly create a supportive and dynamic community within the College of Engineering. However, the pillar that resonates with me the most is fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students. Throughout my life, I've developed an appreciation of sharing my knowledge and experience as it not only helps the people around me grow, but it also aids in my own development. For instance, at the height of the COVID pandemic I hosted free online guitar lessons to kids in my community which helped me work on my craft while also teaching others a new skill. The same can be said for when I was a peer teacher for ENGR 102 this past semester. Ultimately, as a part of SEC I hope to develop my own professional experience by creating an environment that promotes the progression of other like-minded engineering students.",
            "Question 8": "In 8th grade, I was casted as the lead role in the play we were presenting at UIL's One Act Play competition. Being young and a bit immature, I let my temporary achievement go to my head. I only remember practicing my lines outside of rehearsal once, which definitely caused issues come showtime. At the competition, I forgot one of my lines halfway through the show and said something that was meant to prompt the technicians to turn off the lights. Of course, it was not time for the lights to turn off, so we lost a ton of points and finished the show with an underwhelming conclusion. From this humbling experience, I learned to stay determined and motivated until I see things through. I actually saw proof of my growth quite recently. Near the end of last semester I was feeling a bit burnt out, but I needed to ace two of my AERO exams in order to keep my 4.0. Rather than settling for the achievements I had already made, I persevered and ended up finishing strong. Now, anytime I feel overwhelmed I think about that play and remember that continued effort only leads to positive outcomes.",
            "Question 9": "There are many academic projects I enjoyed working on because I was compelled to apply my mind in logical ways. For instance, in a physics class I built a small guitar by analyzing the properties of waves to decide fret placements and string lengths. As a part of DBF I use my knowledge of aerodynamic principles for context when designing aircraft components with CAD. However, when I was working as a server at a nearby bowling alley, I got to enjoy my work in a totally different way; I wasn't applying equations or theorems. Instead, I was learning how to interact with my customers and colleagues in a way that fostered a cheerful environment. A typical day had me serving lanes and tables while dealing with the occasional mishap. Sometimes, we would be understaffed and had to pick up extra tables. Other times we had to find a way to accommodate a large party that had arrived past their scheduled reservation. Ultimately, I enjoyed this job because I got to problem solve in new ways. Not only did I get to work on my conversational and management skills, I got to learn about peoples' backgrounds and hear their stories."

Up until a few months from now, I have been very involved in the three-time world champion SAE Aero Design Team. I was the treasurer last season and I am now the director. I have made it a point throughout my time in leadership to bring more focus to the fact that our organization prepares its members for industry in a way that is unparalleled to any in classroom experience. I have done this through connections with alumni, sharing job opportunities, creating a professional sponsorship packet, and continuing to run the team in a way that mimics industry. Aggies are some of the smartest and most talented engineers out there, and I am excited to be a part of showing that to rest of the world.",
            "Question 8": "Earlier in college, I felt like I had failed an organization, but it was more so failing myself. I applied for a position without looking too much into it. It turned out that because of other commitments, I was only able to go to one or two events, and about half of the officer meetings. It was a professional organization where we hosted events for engineers. The president and main treasurer (I was the assistant finance person) knew that I was already very involved in another organization, and were therefore not expecting me to be extremely involved in this one, and they both told me they understood. I am the kind of person that wants to give my all to everything that I do, and I was not able to do that for this organization. I failed myself in that sense. Since then, I have a better understanding of what I can fit on my plate, and I have been careful not to agree to too much. I also ensure that I have a full grasp on what is expected of me and that I can attend meetings, as I have done with SEC.",
            "Question 9": "I love learning, and I enjoy school most of the time. I love the feeling of really understanding something and being able to give it your all. However, I am probably not alone in saying that my favorite type of work that I have done doesn\u2019t really have to do with school. In high school and for a few years before it, I was the head of the nursery at my church. I was in charge of coordinating with volunteers to make sure there was one in the nursery with me during each service. I was the face greeting the parents, and when I first started working, my boss would say she was always asked about the smiley face in the nursery and if I was available to babysit. It made me proud that I had earned the trust of these parents to leave their very young children (0-2 years old) with me for hours at a time. I got to know a lot of the babies really well, and when I go back home to visit, it is exciting seeing how much they have grown up."

I believe that interacting with new people and introducing them to this beautiful engineering world is essential. Engineering allows us to challenge ourselves and create innovations that can have an impact. I recently volunteered at the SWE High School Conference, where high schoolers from different parts of the US came to learn about the engineering programs at A&M. I was amazed at how engineering brought us together despite all of us being from different backgrounds. Even though I was coaching, I felt myself learning new skills. It was a new experience where I could share my love of engineering with others. I want to help create these programs with SEC and help more people know about engineering and the change they can bring.",
            "Question 8": "After my freshman year of high school, I decided to skip Algebra 2 to accelerate my math education. My counselor and parents suggested that I needed to advance quickly in math to compete with future applicants in STEM majors. I took and failed the second part of the UT credit exam twice. Consequently, I started Pre-Cal sophomore year incredibly unprepared and unable to cope with the course\u2019s rigor because I did not learn the basics in Algebra 2. I realize now that the consultant\u2019s advice to skip Algebra 2 did not make sense for me. We thought that we were doing the best thing for my education and admissions chances. I felt ashamed when I made C\u2019s in pre-cal, the only time in my life.\nNevertheless, my parents and teachers helped me push through and I learned from my experience in high school not to jump too far. In college, I retook Calculus 151, which helped me solidify the foundational skills I needed. I knew I made the right decision when I saw my upward grade trend. It was not easy to go back when I could have learned more, but it helped me truly learn the concepts.",
            "Question 9": "In my senior year of high school, my computer science class gave us an assignment to create our coding project. I felt anxious since I had never done a coding project before from scratch. To make it even harder, it had to be written in a language I didn't know. Despite how insurmountable this task seemed, I pushed forward. I made a plan, thinking about how the display would be and what constraints it needed to have. Slowly and gradually, I started enjoying the process. I looked forward to working on the project and facing new challenges. Since I didn\u2019t know the coding language, I had to research on my own and solve problems by myself. However, the process of solving those problems reminded me of when I used to spend hours doing puzzles when I was younger. I loved overcoming the complications and looking at the results, feeling a sense of accomplishment. To complete a functional project with a new language seemed such a feat; my teacher and parents were amazed at how much I could achieve in such little time. Completing that project showed me not to shy away from obstacles but to be confident in my abilities."

This pillar means the most to me because it bridges the gap between a college engineering student and a professional engineer. By the end of our time here at A&M, we all will have the knowledge of our respective fields and how to apply it, yet what will set us apart is how we deal with ourselves professionally. Competing with engineers across the world for limited job opportunities will not be easy, therefore the small details will be of importance. Characteristics such as how we present ourselves, how we talk to recruiters, how we market ourselves, and how to set ourselves apart are crucial. The world is not an easy place to succeed in, but with the proper help, it can be the difference between a lifelong job or a rejection from a dream job.",
            "Question 8": "When I got rejected from my dream college, Notre Dame, I found myself genuinely mad that I didn\u2019t get in. I was rejected from other schools but for some reason this was different. Yet like all problems, it didn\u2019t last forever, and I soon came to the realization that the reason I was so unhappy is that I believed that I had everything that was needed to be a part of the 14-15% acceptance class. I believed with my heart that I had it all. The grades, essays, extracurriculars, I even managed to talk to the dean of the engineering school in person, everything. Yet my rejection made me realize that sometimes a no is for the better. That \u201cno\u201d made me reevaluate what would make me stand out from others. I realized that the \"unique\" characteristics of my essay were common among the 15%. This led me down a path of not only keeping up the work I did in the past but taking it to another level by putting myself in unfamiliar situations. While it has been uncomfortable, I have seen myself grow new interests, make new friends, become more social in professional settings, and enjoy life more.",
            "Question 9": "There have been many times I have enjoyed doing work. Sports practices, volunteer events, and working for my friend's dad simply to name a few. Yet while thinking about a good answer to this question one stood out from the rest: bussing tables. My first job was bussing tables at a restaurant in my hometown. At first, I felt like the \"new kid\" at the restaurant and it was very awkward, yet as time went on, I soon found what I least expected. A community I loved. I found myself wanting to work more not for the money but to be at the restaurant more. The staff was 90% low twenties servers and one very wise chef who all shared similar interests with me such as sports, school, and engineering! Coming to the restaurant was enjoyable to me because it was a new change. Maybe we were short one day and I had to do a new job, maybe there was a sports game we would watch, or maybe it was a boring day and we all sat in the back talking. Somehow, I found a community out of people I never would have met unless I took that chance."

After reading the email that the SEC sent with career fair information and a guide on how to prepare, all of my inquiries were answered. As an engineering student, I strive to be in an organization that allows students to have a leadership role within the college of engineering and provides opportunities for every engineer to grow professionally.

            "Question 8": "As a freshman in high school, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and join the debate team. Leading up to the first tournament of the year, I worked tirelessly to perfect my case and I felt ready to compete. However, during my first round, it was clear from the moment that my opponent began to present his case that he was the winner. He refuted all of my arguments with ease and my case crumbled before my eyes. After our round ended, I walked out of the room feeling defeated until I ran into my debate coach. When I told her that debate wasn\u2019t for me, she told me that half of our debate team officers considered quitting after their first tournament because of poorly they performed. That was when I realized that I wouldn\u2019t become the debater that I aspired to be after just one tournament. I used my first several tournaments as a learning experience and instead of dreading the experienced debaters, I worked to become more like them. This mindset has allowed me to challenge myself to go after opportunities without the fear of failure because a single defeat never means a final defeat.",

My summer as a counselor taught me so much about how to thrive in a group setting. I played at my strengths and completed behind-the-scenes tasks such as designing posts for Instagram and helping create banners. However, my chairs always encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and I discovered that I loved acting in the skits and brainstorming chants for the yell-off. Over those few months, I watched myself accomplish what I thought was the impossible. I performed in front of a hundred people and I had a conversation with most of the freshmen in my camp. It was such a rewarding feeling to watch all of my hard work pay off in the form of watching the freshmen in my camp laugh at a skit that I had spent weeks perfecting or seeing that the freshmen in my discussion group loved learning about Texas A&M traditions because of the games that my partner and I had created together."

One failure that has stuck with me was due to my move to Texas. After my freshman year, my family had to move for my dad\u2019s career, so I was placed in a completely unknown area with nobody I knew. I had attempted to make friends to help me through the school year, but with Covid striking the nation not too long after, my attempts were unsuccessful. While we were at home due to the virus, I had time to think over my approach and planned something new. After the next school year began, I got much more involved at school and in clubs.

For 19 years of my life, I never had the confidence to voice my words because I thought they didn\u2019t matter to people. Starting this spring semester of my freshman year, I finally realized that it is okay to fail. I never talked because I thought I might say the wrong thing\u2013failing in my mind; however, I realized that \u201cthe wrong thing\u201d is a made-up insecurity that doesn\u2019t exist outside of my head\u2014stuttering a word, accidentally mumbling, answering a question incorrectly, or voicing an unpopular opinion bombarded my train of thought. No wonder I never talked. Although talking to people may be an easy task, my confidence gained from that experience has applied to everything I do now.

            "Question 9": "The only time I genuinely enjoyed doing work was when I had a passion for what I was doing. The satisfying feeling of solving a complex problem will never grow tired for me. Giving a project time and commitment to see it flourish as it gets done fills me with contentment. My passion for coding started during my sophomore year of high school. From then on, I fell in love with learning everything I could about programming languages. My high school teacher suggested competitions I compete in, and I eagerly accepted. For example, one of the competitions involved teams hardening the protection of various operating systems to enhance the overall security. The first year I participated, I was clueless. But that only gave me more reason to figure out what I needed to know to do better. In the second year, competing, I applied everything I learned from the previous year, enjoying working on it because I realized how much better I got. Being passionate about work often creates a better outcome because of how enjoyable it is. If I didn\u2019t share a passion for what I was doing, I wouldn\u2019t have strived to do better in that competition."

Out of the 17 dances we performed my freshman year, I was only in two. I did not fail once or twice, but 15 times. I had been given the tools to be a successful dancer, but yet, with every passing audition, I fell short. However, this failure is what turned me into the person I am today. I learned the importance of positivity. I learned to persevere. I learned that my strength is my refusal to give up. Through this, I not only became a better dancer but a source of support for younger girls who experienced the same setbacks. Although I strive to be successful, I know that without failure, I would not be where I am today.",
            "Question 9": "Over the past two summers, I have worked for a small boutique in Dallas named Dear Hannah. The owner, Hannah, started this clothing business right out of high school and has been running it independently for the past ten years. She created this business from the ground up which is one of the primary reasons I applied to work there. My responsibilities in the store included taking inventory, restocking items, helping customers, and keeping track of the tills. My favorite part of the job was getting to work with Hannah. Her dedication to her passion, as well as her work ethic, inspired me. One of the biggest takeaways I got from watching Hannah interact with customers, brands, and sales associates was the importance of being intentional. Whether that is being intentional with your friends and family or even within the professional world, having intent with every word and action establishes a more amiable environment. This idea has allowed me to pursue meaningful relationships and conversations with people I come into contact with on a daily basis and is a skill I will take with me on my own journey into the professional world."

At this school, we have so many resources and opportunities that it's our job to help inform others. Events that SEC conducts like E-Day and Envision really stand out to me because it works with the youth and because they are all events I wish I would\u2019ve gotten access to when I was younger. I also admire the dedication to continue teaching TAMU students as well with events like industry night and DI Saturday. I know previously I didn\u2019t have as much knowledge of other engineering fields and industry opportunities and I know I have taken valuable information from my involvements there making me a well-rounded aggie engineer. I believe that SEC allows me to apply my knowledge to these goals and act as a platform to find a like-minded community also hoping to spread awareness.",
            "Question 8": "A failure that stuck with me was my struggle during my experience at my first internship. My computer science knowledge was not as advanced as my mentor expected. He typically worked with entering seniors and it was the summer after my freshman year, so there was a huge gap in knowledge between my skills and what my mentor prepared. I felt like a failure, I wasn\u2019t able to meet his expectations and I wasn't meeting my own standards of success/preparedness. It really shocked me as I began my role. As my imposter syndrome grew it was a huge hurdle for me to communicate this struggle to my mentor and manager but it took being at this point to be completely clear about what I was able to accomplish. We were able to work together and change up some of my deadlines to be more fit to my skill level but I was still able to push myself and take so much valuable experience and learning from my work there. I feel like the purpose of failure is to teach you a lesson and I valued the outcome of what I was able to learn from it.",
            "Question 9": "My favorite experience would have to be in teaching. With my robotics team in high school, we were able to conduct STEM camps for middle school students, and I was able to lead the intro to Java camp as the community education director for our team. Although it was work I remember how intimidating programming was when I first learned it in high school. Over the course of the week, being able to explain concepts in ways that the campers were able to grasp was so rewarding. I was glad was able to inspire the students through fun approachable methods and destigmatize CS, especially for the girls in the camp. It also made me realize how much I also enjoyed the material and helped me confirm I was pursuing the right track in college."

When I was in high school, I had no clue what the engineering profession entailed. Even when talking to fellow college students, I\u2019m constantly asked \u201cWhat do engineers even do?\u201d The fact that SEC goes as far as developing a program for kids to learn more about engineering stood out to me. The inclusion of working with young kids/students in the pillar of increasing engineering awareness is something I\u2019d love to be a part of. There is also something I find special about being a female role model for young girls interested in the STEM field. There is a shortage of women in engineering, and I would love to be a part of encouraging the younger generation to look into being successful engineers.",
            "Question 8": "When thinking of this question, I had a hard time finding something to write about that I was willing to share. Certain things felt too personal, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to include something that would show any academic weakness. However, I realized that admitting failure is one of the keys to growth. So, I would like to share my experience with my first Calculus 2 class. I took a 4-week online course during the summer to try to get ahead, but I ended up learning a lot about myself. One of the most important things I had to grasp is to be brutally honest with myself. I knew that I didn\u2019t do well with online learning, but I did it anyway to graduate earlier than expected. If I had waited to take it during the semester, I would have passed the first time, and it wouldn\u2019t have taken such a toll on my GPA. After failing a very important class in my major, I had serious doubts about whether I could continue my track. I had to be completely candid with myself and what I had to do to recover from it.",
            "Question 9": "One of the most rewarding experiences I\u2019ve had while doing work is choreographing an entire dance showcase with the help of my dance team. In my senior year of high school, I was captain of my dance team and was tasked with choreographing 9 dances for the showcase. I knew it would be a challenge, but it was something I was passionate about and I knew I could step up. With this project, I was able to collaborate with my teammates and learn a lot about leadership and teamwork. Even as the deadline was closer, I found myself getting more excited rather than stressed. I took in the feeling of passion and pride in what I was doing and used it to put extra hours in and sacrifice what I needed to create the best show possible. I knew that if I was able to put this much effort into something I loved, I would have to do something with my career that I could have as much passion for. Thank goodness I chose engineering!"

However, ensuring that these resources are catered to properly address student's needs and are distributed in the most optimal manner is essential. The representative aspect of SEC truly appeals to my passion for justice and providing a platform to hear the voices of diverse individuals. Already, I\u2019ve been an active participant in this sort of community through the judicial board of my school last year, where I served as a student advocate on the disciplinary board. As a member of SEC, I hope to join the legislative committee and help continue conveying the sentiments of students to faculty and staff.",
            "Question 8": "Last year, a few of my college friends began skateboarding together. Watching them barrel down parking garages and perform kick flips, I desperately wanted to join. I began to learn to skate alongside my friends, who would guide me on what slopes I could and couldn\u2019t handle. However, I quickly became restless, wanting to skate at their level. One night, my group decided to skate down a steep tunnel connecting west and main campus. I was sure I could handle the speed, and ignoring my friend\u2019s advice, I kicked off, helmetless and knee padless. Within moments, speed wobbles took over, my board hit a bump and I went flying. As I was carried to the on-campus health center, regret and embarrassment rushed through my blood. That night, not only had I completely misjudged my abilities, but I had also failed to listen to my experienced friends. The scars on my knees and elbows serve to remind me of the importance of considering the advice of others, something that has extended to other aspects of my life. Now, when my coding project manager warns me about the risks of implementing a specific algorithm, I am much more receptive to their suggestions.",
            "Question 9": "Snap! The latex gloves engulfed my skin. Click! The tubular oven was set in place, ready to be preheated. Hiss! The nitrogen tank came to life.\nTwo summers ago, I received the TAMS summer research scholarship which funded my research at the University of North Texas and allowed me to fully devote two months to my chemistry research. As I spent 8-9 hours in the lab daily, attended research seminars on the weekends, and ate meals with professors, peers, and professionals in the field, my research endeavors enveloped me. During this time, I observed theoretical concepts come to life and found joy in the smaller discoveries we made towards our goal of characterizing the nitrogen reduction reaction into ammonia through infrared spectroscopy. I became proficient in lab techniques including wafer cutting, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and 3D printing, and enjoyed the collaborative nature of the research environment. As we would divide and conquer, devouring research papers with an astounding fervor, and then coming together, attacking the whiteboard with diagrams, ideas, and questions, I thrived in the academia focused fervor. Ultimately I spent almost two years working in that research lab, and have now continued research work at A&M."

Choosing a major that will likely stick with me for the rest of my life was a very daunting decision, not only because there were so many options, but also because I had to consider the natural world and how I could apply myself. During my first semester, I had doubts about whether to change to another specialization. Because of this, I can only imagine the hardship many students go through just learning about each major and what it truly has to offer to them because it can seem very challenging and lead them down a path of confusion. Furthermore, that decision is hastened by the quickly approaching ETAM deadline. Helping as many freshmen and upperclassmen find a home in the Engineering Department is our duty as fellow Aggies.",
            "Question 8": "In High School, I was one of the Drum Majors for my marching band. We were tasked with leading rehearsals and taking care of the technical problems before they got to the directors. For one of our state marching rehearsals, I ran the metronome for the entire band. I didn't notice that the battery of the speaker was running out, which ultimately led to the metronome dying while the band was marching. At that moment, I signaled to the head drum major to continue going without the metronome until we finished that section. Needless to say, my director was very angry and disappointed, as it was one of our basic jobs as Drum Major, and I failed at it, which cost the band that much time. However, that experience, as scary as it was, helped me understand that mistakes, as embarrassing as they are, will happen, and the way one maintains themself will dictate how that will affect others and how they will learn from it. I was calm and thought on my feet, as I signaled to the head drum major and, after the rep, ran to get a new speaker.",
            "Question 9": "Being a Drum Major for a high school band was the most rewarding experience I have ever had. Though I have been in multiple internships that have taught me how to work in a professional environment, band has taught me how to be a leader, a teacher, a student, and a friend. Every single week in the latter half of July all the way until the first week of November, I was outside with my band, going through rehearsals, playing music, and marching on the concrete field under the hot Texas sun. As arduous as it was, it was rewarding as I got to truly help and teach kids while they were struggling or not understanding. In essence, I could be the shoulder they leaned on, the hand they reached out to when they needed help: the olive branch. I enjoyed it because I got to see them become better, stronger, and happier people as they worked hard with each other to bring to fruition one of the best competitive shows our program has seen. It also made me a better person because I could understand how people react to certain situations and how to help them because of that."

This is important to me because although some students come in having a strong grasp on what they want to do and the path to get there, a lot of other students are very lost in the process and have trouble making progress professionally. For example, I personally was not sure what type of engineering I wanted to do, and I honestly still am unsure about what specifically I want to do within mechanical engineering.

            "Question 8": "Although it was a while ago, my freshman year region band failure still hits the hardest to date. It was my freshman year of Region Band, and I was going in with hopes of making the Area Band. Coming off my previous audition where I placed very high and made Region Orchestra, my expectations for the auditions were at an all-time high. I walked into the region room, gave my performance, and came out ready to wait for results. I thought I had performed well, but little did I know that I didn\u2019t make it. For the past two years of region auditions I have always exceeded my expectations, but this time I came out a failure. It took a while to come to terms with the loss, but eventually I decided it was time to get to work. My drive for success and hard work overcame me and I ended up making Area the next year and eventually made State. This failure has turned me into a better and more hardworking person.

            "Question 9": "There were many times that I enjoyed doing work over the summer of 2022. Over this past summer I was lucky and skilled enough to go on tour with Drum Corps International\u2019s (DCI\u2019s) Blue Stars. DCI is a competitive organization where over 20 marching band ensembles perform shows to compete at the highest level of the marching arts. These amazing performance opportunities come with a toll of long hours of rigorous hard work and daily rehearsal. Although the work was often tiring, I had to enjoy every second of it while it lasted because it was all over in the blink of an eye. Not only did the friends around me make it enjoyable, but knowing what we were working towards gave me energy every day. That final reward of a performance in Lucas Oil Stadium made me enjoy and appreciate the work that was put in despite how taxing it was. Furthermore, I loved to see the progress that was made during the rehearsals both as an individual and as a group. In all, seeing us inch towards our end goal is all I needed to enjoy the work that was being done."

To me, there's no better way to serve someone than to relate with them personally and stand up for them to make sure their voice is heard. This pillar is also essential to the other two pillars of the mission statement. Without acting as a voice for engineers, how are we supposed to effectively spread awareness about engineering or professionally advance its students?",
            "Question 8": "One example that is particularly applicable to this question is when I failed to reach my academic goals in my freshman year in the College of Engineering at Texas A&M. To be considered as a competitive candidate for Entry to a Major applications and future internships, my goal was to achieve 3.5 or higher for my cumulative grade point average. Needless to say I was humbled when after two semesters I was sitting at around 2.9 GPA. I seriously reevaluated my approach to academics. I knew I was a capable student and had the ability to achieve better results, I just needed to find a better way to handle college level academics. After taking an elective class about learning development and using the collective lessons I learned in my freshman year, I posted a 3.4 semester GPA in my fall semester of Sophomore year with the highest amount of hours taken yet in my college career. While I do not believe that grades are what define a person, I have learned what it means to struggle and how to look at my life from a different perspective to overcome a major hurdle such as beginning college-level academics.",

When I attended my first lab, I remember leaving the electrical measurement lab with a smile on my face. The lab itself was really challenging and frustrating at times, but once I was able to complete it successfully, a wave of accomplishment washed over me. This exact experience is why I chose engineering. I wanted to take my interests with engineering and use technology and ingenuity to tackle challenging problems head on.

            "Question 8": "Failure is hard to admit to. Even harder to own up to. For a long time I was terrified of failure. My first year at A&M, I was so afraid of failure that I didn\u2019t even try. Because to try and fail would have hurt my pride. It\u2019s always easier to not try, and to not care. I always had an excuse: \u201cI failed that test because I didn\u2019t try\u201d. This mindset had me digging my own grave. I got an F in a subject that I had always been good at, and it was a tough pill to swallow. I am grateful for it nonetheless, It taught me that failure is just a result of trying. And to stop making excuses and feeling sorry for myself. I learned to take full ownership of my failure, and to get up and try again. Failure is just a precursor to success, we all fail. The most important thing you can do is try. Being unashamed to fail is the greatest freedom known to man. Failure is not a one time deal, I will fail again, and there is nothing wrong with that.

I was so used to get all A\u2019s my whole life, and having to tell people I got a B made me think they would be disappointed in me or change their opinion of me. Over time I came to realize that a grade does not define me and that people will still support me no matter what my grades are. I learned that a grade is just a number and letter, and what is really important is the knowledge I gain.

Unfortunately, I brushed off the class, kicked the can down the road, and took it at half the expected pace. By the midterm, my grades were close to failing. I was so behind that I couldn\u2019t take the exam. It got to the point where I dreaded schoolwork, and my grades began declining in other subjects. My parents, principal, and teacher recommended that I drop the class. But I refused to give up and compressed three months of the class into three weeks. I decided to spend every spare waking moment focusing solely on math and pulled myself out of that situation through sheer force of will. Since that class, I have learned to prepare and be proactive. When I sign up for something, I plan accordingly and complete the task to the best of my ability, no matter how many tries or how much time and effort it takes.",
            "Question 9": "My favorite time working was when my best friend in high school and I created an invention named The Bagasse Boiler for the Jacobs Teen Innovation Challenge. Bagasse is the pulpy waste product of the sugarcane refining process. It costs over five hundred million dollars annually to store and dispose of the five billion tons of bagasse produced yearly by sugar mills. My family are sugarcane farmers, so I had a vested interest in trying to solve the problem. Our bagasse boiler prototype burned bagasse to produce steam that could be used to generate energy. It also created a byproduct called fly ash, which could be used to strengthen particle board and concrete while making them cheaper and more durable. We introduced ourselves to local welders, a chemist, and an engineer. Meeting, consulting, and working with them was an incredible opportunity. We won third place in the international competition and donated our winnings to the Forest Stewardship Council. It was the first time I collaborated to invent and create a working prototype as part of a team. The whole year-long experience was one of the most rewarding things I\u2019ve done."

            "Question 8": "I once failed to deliver a project on time due to poor time management and underestimating the amount of work required. This failure was a wake-up call for me and I realized I needed to improve my planning and organizational skills. I took the time to reflect on what went wrong and identified areas for improvement.\nTo prevent similar failures in the future, I started prioritizing my tasks and breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable steps. I also became more disciplined about sticking to a schedule and using tools to track my progress. Through these efforts, I was able better to manage my time and complete projects on time.\nIn conclusion, failing at something can be a valuable learning experience if you take the time to reflect on what went wrong and take steps to improve. This experience taught me the importance of proper planning and organization and helped me become a more effective project manager.",

            "Question 8": "In my sophomore year, I embarked on a mission to use only standardized parts and 3d printing to create a fully functioning mobile controlled RC car. I think due to my lack of experience in mechanical and design, a lack of fully forethought planning made it difficult to efficiently execute the building process. During this time, I was in India, pre-pandemic made it hard to find parts online with ease, hence I had to find parts in electronic district streets. I believe this was the hardest part of the process for me. I was able to build a working prototype for the car\u2019s powertrain that could be controlled by the app on my phone. Due to my late enrollment to that school however, I had overestimated my time constraints for the project. I believe this overestimation was my biggest failure here. I had to submit the motor + differential prototype as my final product and this was not the outcome that I had envisioned. Due to this experience, I have learned to never overestimate myself or the resources I have at my disposal. In future projects, I know that the planning must account for the inevitable constraints that I have.",
            "Question 9": "During 11th grade IB business management, I was assigned to a group project about generating a business plan for a restaurant, as a product of our own creativity.

My group was also very enthusiastic about the ideas that I proposed. We devised a comprehensive business plan, covering the restaurant\u2019s menu, creative vision and overall mission statement, planned urban locations, staff positions, finances (from investment, periodic cash flow, to profitability), etc. Our teacher was impressed to the point that she chose our submission as the benchmark for that project. It was an in-depth presentation that due to a well handled collaboration was able to show care to the smallest details. It showed me that with shared enthusiasm and collaboration, first-class results can be achieved. It\u2019s definitely helped me be someone that is always invested as I\u2019ve seen firsthand, the potential of the end result. Albeit from an external perspective this wasn\u2019t more than a flashy group presentation, the ideas showcased of leadership, creativity, and collective enthusiasm are applicable to innovation throughout the professional landscape."

            "Question 8": "One time that I failed at something was when I applied for drum major in my high school band. I was incredibly involved in the band and wanted to improve it in any way possible. I practiced for drum major for hours every week, putting in time with the current drum majors and time on my own, trying to perfect my conducting as best I could. After all of this work, I felt as though I was guaranteed the drum major position. However, when they released the results I was still the section leader. I couldn\u2019t help feeling angry and cheated, thinking that I was owed drum major after all my efforts. Over time, however, I came to realize that maybe I was best suited as a section leader. As section leader, I knew each individual member on a deeper level and could play off of each person\u2019s strengths and weaknesses much better since I was working on a smaller scale. I learned that no matter how hard I work at something in life, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll always get what I want, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t make the most of any situation life throws at me.",

            "Question 8": "Near the middle of my senior year, half of my student council officers quit. I was then charged with twice the responsibility as a newly elected president and nearly caved under the pressure. For the following weeks, I neglected my duties as classes became more difficult around our midterm season. Over the course of these few weeks we had needed to raise money for prom and fundraisers, but our coffers had run dry. As the president, it was my responsibility to get us back on track. I spent a large portion of my own money to get us to a state where we could raise enough money for prom. This taught me to stay consistent and bear the responsibilities as they came. As the year went on, we raised the $3,500 needed for prom. That role that I was given made me appreciate positions of power and I grew from it. Specifically in my stress management abilities and rational thinking, as both were needed as a class president of a relatively poor school.

            "Question 9": "One time that work was uniquely gratifying for me was one of my volunteering opportunities at Habitat for Humanity. This organization provides many people with an affordable avenue to housing, and volunteers like me would help actualize these homes. At the time I was about 16 or 17 and I was working on a home for an older man and his wife. The work itself was physically demanding and quite nice since we got to work in teams and make new friends. I was in charge of making cupboards for the home, nailing in the floor trim, and putting on a shed door. Near the end of the day the man, whose house we were building, came onto the work site and introduced himself. For some reason, making a mental connection between all the hard work everyone was doing and seeing this man made me far happier than I can describe in words. The satisfaction that washed over me as I realized where all our labor was going assured me that we were doing something truly meaningful. That same love for service has carried me all throughout my life, and I'm glad I could help those two."

Education is truly the cornerstone of every successful person, no matter what form it is. However, in an academic environment, students need to sharpen their skills to tactically succeed in the real world - with their engineering knowledge as an aid. While making a resume and updating our LinkedIn may seem like fundamental to many of us, this idea may seem foreign to many students who never had the privilege of being exposed to these skills prior to college. College is tricky enough to navigate, between the relationships we form and the classes we take, when students aren\u2019t on the same level playing field as their peers, they are bound to fall behind in areas that carry weight once we leave Aggieland.",
            "Question 8": "At the time, I felt like my biggest failure was not getting into UC Berkeley. Looking back, I can be honest with myself as to why I thought I had failed. During high school, I poured myself into extracurriculars, activities, and even interactions that would take me to my dream school. I even spent several hundred dollars and several hours speaking with admissions counselors to maximize my chance of gaining admission. However, in March 2022 - I figured it wasn\u2019t meant to be. At the time, it was nothing short of devastation, I mean what had I done it all for? This was a weight I held over my head till the day I came to A&M. However, by joining clubs and meeting new people, I realized that I really hadn\u2019t failed academically, I had failed myself by tying myself up in the rat race everyone was in - being hung up on \u2018what could have happened\u2019.

            "Question 9": "Two summers ago, I taught elementary school children coding. Firstly, this experience allowed me to share the subjects that I hold dear to my heart. Beyond coding, the ability to create something by yourself using thought processes is a gift that I was able to pass on to my students. Secondly, I feel that I learned more from my students than they did from me. My students came from a variety of backgrounds: some with proficiency, some with beginners, and even some that had learning disabilities. We would have a standardized curriculum - which proved to be a challenge. Given all these differences and the attention span of the average fourth grader, it was difficult to accomplish anything. However, we they overcame this by understanding what that class meant to them. For example, one of my students had ADHD and would struggle to think through programs. However, he really loved sharks. I encouraged him to maybe think about how he can involve sharks with programming, and sure enough, he was interested in building some kind of graphical representation of a whale shark. I hope that one day they incorporate what we learned together and apply it to all facets of their lives."

This is the power of awareness - The word engineering gets thrown out a lot, but do freshmen and others really know what it is? All the diverse fields, the diverse responsibilities? You might learn how to be an engineer in school, but it is harder to truly learn WHAT an engineer is.

I remember being disheartened by the end of the day, thinking that this was simply too much for me to handle, that I should find some other way to help my community. However, I ultimately persevered - I went to the older volunteers, and figured out what I needed to learn to improve. I was proactive, and did not let my failure stop me, but let it encourage me to persevere. Through this, I learned the importance of seeking help and guidance from experienced individuals in order to improve and succeed, and the value of collaboration and communication.

It was hard, tedious work, but I enjoyed it greatly because I knew that I was working for something greater than myself, and I had an amazing group of people around me who were just as passionate as I was, pushing me to grow and develop as both a counselor and human being. When fish camp came, it was initially quite difficult - the freshmen were shy, closed off, and overwhelmed by everything. However, through our constant efforts, they were able to open up and make relationships with their fellow future aggies. This is the part I enjoyed the most - I got to see these freshmen grow during these three days, open up, and let down their barriers and be themselves around us. It made everything I worked for all worth it, and truly made me enjoy everything that I did."

            "Question 8": "Over the summer, while I was working for a valet company, I had been driving customers cars to the designated valet area, back and forth. At this time, we were understaffed and extremely busy. During this process I accidently held onto a customers key in my pocket as I did not realize I was holding onto two sets of keys. After my shift ended, and I drove home I realized that I had held onto the key, and therefore failed at satisfying the demand of the customer, and had to drive back to work to fix this issue. I felt like I had let the customer down, and in the end they were not able to get their key in time for work. After this incident, I had cleaned up any mistakes I had made when dealing with customers keys and never made the same mistake twice.

Even my older brother (a 2018 TAMU engineering graduate) supported me as a freshman.\nThis opportunity isn\u2019t universal which is why freshmen across the country often undergo a rough shift from high school to college.\nTAMU engineers come from everywhere and each have their own distinctive backgrounds, yet they\u2019re all connected by their passion for engineering. Being a uniting voice for them would allow me to help freshmen enter college and succeed in their desired field of engineering.",
            "Question 8": "7:58 pm. Final performance of high school. If I didn't get this role, I wouldn't be able to act again.\n8:00 pm. And\u2026I didn't get it. Dread washed over me as I thought about what this meant. I wasn\u2019t gonna act again. My last chance and I blew it.\nThe following morning, every little thing that went wrong felt like another disappointment breaking me down. I tried not thinking about the lost role, but it was cemented in my mind. I lost focus in my classes and next thing I knew, I was five inches away from walking head-on into traffic. I\u2019d missed out on roles before but this hurt more, It wasn't a smooth day, but I had to move on.\nThe following day at school, the thought of the role was still there but I didn\u2019t let it distract me. I took the day slowly and just concentrated on what was in front of me. That day felt better and so did I.\nAnd then I realized, we deteriorate a little every day, but simultaneously, we nurture and improve ourselves each day. Our thoughts shape our actions and our actions shape our identity.",
            "Question 9": "The stage was set, the lights were on, and there was my cue. Out jumps this shirtless 11th grader in bright yellow tights in front of 150 audience members. And the crowd goes wild.\nThat feeling of being in the public sphere and performing was so captivating and even though this was a mandatory performance as part of my school\u2019s curriculum, I knew something in me had changed,.\nI wasn\u2019t very sociable in middle school and I abhorred public speaking, until I decided to join my high school\u2019s theatre troupe. It allowed me to meet new people and join an organization dedicated to helping people breaking out of their shell.\nEven if rehearsals would sometimes last over 15 hours, that sensation of being on stage and representing my high school in such a public manner in front of hundreds of people made it all worth it. Plus I got the opportunity to create intricate sets using advanced power tools and apply my woodworking skills.\nThe bright lights, uncomfortable costumes, and smell of sawdust made theatre my favorite place to be.\nAlthough one could call it \u201cwork,\u201d theatre was a passion that honed my engineering skills and shaped my adult personality."

This event has introduced me to people and opportunities that likely would have never been introduced into my life without the effort and support the SEC puts into the career fair every semester. Additionally, the action the SEC puts into DI Saturday twice a year is really helpful for freshmen, including myself a year ago, as it helped me choose my current major, Electrical Engineering.",
            "Question 8": "In my opinion, failure is an event that occurs naturally in life. It is often seen as a negative occurrence and, while it is often disheartening, I like to see it as something that can also be beneficial. During my freshman year, I was shocked to see my failing score on my Physics exam after I had tirelessly studied for it. I began to feel stressed as I thought about the lone remaining exam and the fast approaching Q-drop deadline. After speaking with my professor, I began to feel disheartened. However, I refused to let the first exam set a precedent in the class and began a tiring study routine in order to maximize my chances of passing the final exam. I did not want to Q-drop as I believed in my own ability to pass not only the exam, but the class as a whole. I ended up taking the final exam and exceeding my expectations in the course. From this situation, I learned important lessons about maintaining a proper study routine, staying up to date in classes, and asking for help. Most importantly, I learned not to let one failure define me or cause me to quit.",
            "Question 9": "My favorite moments of doing work took place at my summer job where I worked at Sunglass Hut. While my official title was Sales Associate, it felt like much more than that. I was able to connect with customers as I listened to personal details of their lives that they chose to share with me. The idea of connecting with a stranger due to shared interests is inspirational and something that can be used in all aspects of life. I truly enjoyed my time at this job because it did not feel like something I was forced to do, but instead something I enjoyed and learned from. However, there were some difficult lessons that it taught me as well. I learned how to have a positive attitude even when coming across customers who proved difficult to work with. I was also able to apply managerial skills at a fast, efficient pace. I learned a lot about interacting with customers in terms of conversation, especially ones that I was not familiar with. My coworkers taught me that working with a team that was understanding and enthusiastic about their job was a perfect environment to witness what teamwork truly looked like."

By being that representative voice, the SEC is ensuring that the needs and perspectives of engineering students are being effectively communicated and represented to both the College of Engineering, as well as the broader community. This mediator role can look like advocating for something such as a lack of resources or support and helps ensure that the overall experience of engineering students at the university is as positive and impactful as possible. The SEC provides a platform for engineering students to share their ideas and perspectives, through modes such as the semesterly SEC Engineering Student Survey. The SEC has a vital role in promoting the interests and well-being of engineering students, and in fostering a strong, supportive community within the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 8": "My failures are the basis for my greatest learning experiences. I did not initially get into the major of my choice when I went through the ETAM process. My physics grade had tanked my GPA and not only was I no longer eligible for auto-entry, but both my scholarship and status as an honors student were also in danger. At that moment, I had to decide what my new plan was going to be since the future I had planned out relied on me getting into the major of my choice, and immediately take action. I plunged head-first into the deep end, without the guarantee that I was going to be able to transfer successfully. That summer I took classes full-time to boost my GPA back up to safety. In the following semesters, I got very involved with the department and I formed relationships with my professors. I got an internship and was selected for programs aligned with my interests to continue growing my knowledge. My initial failure was heartbreaking, but the journey since then has taught me so much about myself, my interests, and how far I am willing to go to earn my place.",
            "Question 9": "In my hometown, I would volunteer for a camp hosted for the kids in my neighborhood. Not only do I love kids, but I would work with so many of my friends that it was impossible not to look forward to every day. During my last year there, I was tasked with planning one of the largest events we would host that season: a field day. Thankfully, I was working on a team with three of my friends. The instructions seemed simple enough: organizing a whole day of activities for around 60 kids. As we started delegating work, however, it finally became clear how much we would have to coordinate. There was the question of materials, the itinerary, and making sure to keep the waters stocked. My team had been working together the whole summer, so we knew how to play to our strengths. I love deals, couponing, and bargaining. So naturally, I oversaw the financials: finding the materials and planning the purchases for the event. The big day finally came, and it was a successful day of fun for everyone! We also ended up spending less than the allotted budget, so it was a win in my book."

But now that I\u2019ve spent more time at A&M and just attended my second career fair, I\u2019ve come to the realization that professional development will be the most impactful thing I can gain during my time in the College of Engineering. Professionalism is important to me because no matter what gender or ethnicity an engineer is, the two things he or she is now most commonly judged by is the way they interact with others, and the passion he or she acts with when faced with a problem to solve.",
            "Question 8": "The failure that I\u2019m going to talk about was four years in the making when it happened. Growing up, my main hobby and passion was volleyball. At the beginning of my freshman year, I began to feel sharp pains in my right shoulder every time I hit the ball. Many coaches I\u2019d had before that season advised me to change the way I hit the ball in order to engage more of my deltoid muscles instead of pushing the smaller ones past what they could physically handle. Because I never changed the way I swung at the ball, the pain eventually worsened to become scapular dyskinesis, an injury that cost me a potential future volleyball career. Through this well-deserved reality check, not only did I learn that I\u2019m not invincible, I also learned the importance of listening to the people who care for me and people who know more than I do. It\u2019s necessary for us to risk doing things we may not like at first, because in the end those uncomfortable situations will promote more self-growth than we ever thought possible.",
            "Question 9": "During my two years of physics classes in high school, we were assigned a few group projects: a Rube Goldberg machine, a cardboard boat that we floated across a pool and back with two people aboard for credit, and a wireless remote control car. Each of those projects took an insane amount of effort and time, but the one I enjoyed most was definitely the RC car. That hands-on project was the first time I got to do something that sparked my interest in Mechanical Engineering. To make things more exciting, our teacher never taught us a thing about building functional motors or RC cars. Because we were dramatically inexperienced high school students, accomplishing this project required us to watch a ridiculous amount of YouTube videos and research tire materials, servos, light-weight plastics- anything we didn\u2019t already know (which was everything). The late nights, small wins, and hours of stressfully eating Crumbl Cookies with my group led the four of us to become great friends, and I wouldn\u2019t trade that experience for anything. That project was the first time I got to explore my passion for engineering, and I\u2019m extremely grateful to have had that opportunity."

Classes and seminars are very good at teaching concepts and introducing key fundamentals of the industry, but rarely do they educate students on the actual interworkings of what it is to work in a professional setting. This pillar of the SEC organization at Texas A&M helps bridge the gap between college and career, which aids in the development of future endeavors and heightens the likelihood of success for students within the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 8": "Failing is an unavoidable part of life; however, they also serve as learning experiences from which people can grow and improve. One time I faced failure was when I went through a scholarship interview. I had not prepared enough for the types of questions that were asked and felt flustered in the room of ten people prompting me. Although I did not end up getting selected for the scholarship, I still learned many things from that experience. Firstly, that was my first interview experience and with the process being so prevalent in the job-finding procedure, it laid a foundation for future interviews with employers. Also, my public speaking skills definitely improved as I had never spoken to that many people at once and the new experience exposed me to this skill. I also learned what types of questions interviewers ask and what to expect for the next one. Overall, although a tough pill to swallow at the time, I think that this experience of failure definitely helped me grow as a person and a future engineer",
            "Question 9": "The term \u201cwork\u201d is often associated with grueling, laborious tasks that are not pleasant to experience; however sometimes \u201cwork\u201d comes along in which the task is actually enjoyable. For me, this occurred when I had to finish the end-of-semester programming project for my Engineering 102 course. When the assignment of coding three distinct games was presented to me, my mind immediately started exploring the different possibilities of games I could code. After filtering through, I eventually settled on hangman, wordle, and rock, paper, scissors. Upon starting to code, I ran into many different syntax, logic, and runtime errors which required me to learn new skills such as the debugger tool. Also, I enjoyed the satisfaction of resolving an error and the right output being produced, which kept me motivated to keep going. The culmination of all my knowledge was put to the test and I could see where it would be implemented in a real-life scenario/task. After finishing the project, seeing three functioning games in a cohesive interface gave me confidence that I could succeed in my major of choice, which is why I enjoyed the \u201cwork\u201d assigned."

            "Question 8": "Failure comes in many different ways, shapes, and forms. For me, failure came when I went through the Entry to a Major process. Unfortunately, I did not get selected to be in Computer Science because of my GPA and got placed in Electrical Engineering. When I heard of this, I felt lost and I had no idea what to do since I did not feel passionate about hardware. After weeks of thinking about what the best idea was, I decided that I would try to change my major until I was in Computer Science. I worked myself to the limit to accomplish this goal, so much so that I achieved a semester with a 4.0 GPA as well as being involved on campus and participating in extracurricular activities to better my career. After this, I was able to switch into Computer Science and am finally passionate about my career path.

            "Question 9": "Last spring, I participated in The Big Event and was grouped up with 9 individuals I had never met. We were assigned to go to a large house and help pull out the weeds from their garden. At first, this sounded like it was going to be the most draining 6 hours ever. The weather was so hot and pulling weeds is not particularly a fun job. However, as soon as we started working, all of us began to get to know each other and had a good time talking while pulling the weeds. After the job was done, we all felt fulfilled and decided to go grab a bite to eat together to celebrate. To this day, we all still keep in contact with each other and occasionally hang out. Why did I enjoy the job? Having the opportunity to get to know people and having company while doing the job made it really enjoyable, even though it was an errand that I would have never imagined would be fun. Having people work alongside me makes working much more enjoyable, no matter the task."

Sadly, I was not offered any of my top three majors, causing me to doubt myself and feel extreme anxiety. Emailing any advisors, professors, and deans who would listen, I turned these negative emotions into drive and was fueled with determination. I made a plan for success, taking difficult courses with the goal of succeeding in them to prove myself as a student. That semester, Fall 2022, I earned a 4.0 taking 16 hours which significantly raised my overall GPA and confidence in my abilities. Despite this success, I was again rejected from my top three majors.

            "Question 8": "When I was in sixth grade, my dad started to buy me into leisurely poker games between the dads at Chinese parties. Most of these guys played around once a year, except for Bruce. Bruce always laughed as he took my (dad\u2019s) money, as if he didn\u2019t have to exert himself at all. I lost to him, failing again and again. It took me five years before I finally experienced his countenance as I accepted his dollar bills. Those failures led me to grow into the competitor I am today. Success isn\u2019t fluked. Every drop of it is clawed at, ripped away, and clung onto until your hands start blistering. To the amateur eye, poker is a game of chance; a lucky river card can save a horrible player every once in a while. It\u2019s part of life. However, the majority of the game is dictated by the hours immersed in books, eyes glued to EV charts until they were my antiphons. And that\u2019s who I am: the man who will work behind closed doors in ways that others cannot even begin to imagine, hands blanketed in callouses and blisters.",
            "Question 9": "During my trips to rural China and Peru, community leaders explained how locals' hard work throughout their daily lives often took priority over public health practices, like washing hands before a meal. When I got home, I felt compelled to start my publication Unihealth. It\u2019s a multi-media platform (originally beginning with children\u2019s books) designed to provide public health educatation in easily digested forms. Although I had worked for publications before, much of what I was doing was completely foreign, like building the front and back ends of a website from the ground up. Tensions often flared amongst my team, yet I was always willing to endure for the project. The work of Unihealth was fulfilling in that we knew we were making a difference in a cause we cared so much about that we couldn\u2019t bare to stand pat. It\u2019s the type of work I have chased for every moment in the short time I have attended this institution.

I failed to think ahead regarding how to control the car\u2019s movement and how to stop it. It started to veer right and as I tried to stop it like superman, I realized I could not stop it even though it was going slowly. It ended up crashing into a concrete support of a parking garage as I dove inside to hit the brakes. At this point the damage was done. Luckily no one was hurt, but I was face down on the floor of the driver\u2019s side lamenting the damage to my car, which was newly customized. I instantly regretted my decision to make this video.

            "Question 7": "I recently attended the SEC Career Fair and I am so grateful I did. I had the opportunity to speak with many companies as a freshman. They showed me countless ways engineering could be applied. Going into engineering, I had no idea what career path I wanted to pursue, so that is why SEC fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students is so impactful for me. I have just begun to dip my toes in the water discovering job opportunities through Texas A&M Engineering. I want to help other people discover their perfect career path, and I believe SEC is already doing that for thousands of students. I would love more than anything to be a part of impacting and influencing the future for engineers at Texas A&M. I believe engineers are on the edge of innovation and growing their professionalism will greatly impact society.",
            "Question 8": "Growing up my dream was to be a part of my high school\u2019s drill team. I had dedicated 6 years of my life to prepare for the audition. Despite these preparations, I did not make the team. This failure forced me to make room for better opportunities and new insight into other interests. I discovered my passion for STEM; learning different sciences simultaneously solidified my hope to be an engineer. During my sophomore year of high school, I realized science was my favorite subject, followed closely by math. I knew that I wanted to focus on these fields during my junior year, and I was now able to take more classes with more time in my schedule. I enrolled in Brain Health and Science, AP Chemistry, and Honors Physics. As I studied, I began to see connections between each subject. I learned about waves in Chemistry and light in both Brain Health and Science and Physics. Each class had a different perspective on this topic, but they all correlated with one another. My newly found time at school energized me and gave me hope for new goals and aspirations.",
            "Question 9": "During my junior year of high school, I built a truss bridge out of paper, toothpicks, and elmer\u2019s glue for my honors physics class. I was nervous about this project in the beginning. I did not have any previous experience with engineering a model. During the two weeks I worked on this project, I really enjoyed myself. Bridges are a necessary tool that millions of people use on a daily basis. I learned about their inner workings, as well as the math and science behind them. I learned about the forces that are constantly pushing and pulling on bridges and how tension is necessary for a successful bridge. After many models and tests, I finally succeeded by going above and beyond what was required for the assignment and building the strongest bridge in my class. This project opened my eyes to engineering. I had never considered studying engineering, but after this project, it became my dream major. Without my physics class\u2019s project, I may have never discovered my enthusiasm for engineering."

            "Question 7": "When deciding to apply to SEC, the involvement and engagement they have with the university and outside prospects are what drew me in. The first pillar represents this through their efforts in increasing engineering awareness. Not only have I experienced and been impressed by their events like DI Saturday, industry night, and career fair, but I also have other interests in programs they host beyond that. The SEC EnVision program is something that I hope to get involved in. During high school, I played a role in creating a club called \u201cSTEM Siblings\u201d that got recognition from the superintendent and local newsletters. It worked to expose elementary students to the world of STEM through various lessons and activities. I feel with this experience I have the skills and ideas that can contribute to the success of EnVision with it being such a similar concept.",
            "Question 8": "In my life, I have always set high goals and standards for myself. I was an AP/honors student who strived to get all As. During my sophomore year, I chose to take AP Physics, a class I heard was difficult, but one that I thought I would be able to handle. My teacher\u2019s teaching style made it hard for me to learn and our first test came faster than I thought. After feeling prepared for the test, I was very disappointed when I saw a 50 in the grade book. This absolutely destroyed my confidence and I might have cried several times. From that moment on, I knew I needed to make a change. Simply doing well on the other tests was not enough to get my grade to where I wanted it to be, so I had to find alternatives. After finding out that participating in a science fair replaced my lowest test grade, I knew I needed to do it. Although it added extra work to my other extracurriculars and schoolwork, I made the time. This experience taught me that there is always a way to come back from failure and that I should not dwell on past mistakes.",
            "Question 9": "Living near NASA my whole life has allowed me to constantly be surrounded by engineers. Since my dad works there, I have had the privilege of being exposed to so many cool and fascinating people and places. This has provoked inspiration in becoming an engineer myself. In high school, I made sure to take a variety of engineering classes that would help me gain a good foundation for my engineering college career. One class in particular that sparked my interest was the aerospace engineering class I took during my senior year. To be honest, all the work we did in that class did not feel like work at all. I genuinely enjoyed the assignments and projects we did. This helped me realize that aerospace is the degree I wanted to pursue. There was one project in particular though that drew me in; flight simulation. For a whole week, we got to \u201cfly planes\u201d by using school-provided controllers and applications. This project also inspired me to want to get my pilot's license which I hope to accomplish this summer."

Being an organization that is open and accessible to students to reach out for help or advice whether it be academics, career or anything else, is an important aspect that I see SEC commit to such as the president taking the feedback from organizations under the SEC and relaying them to the dean to create/push for change. Often think SEC as an amplifier that takes in the voices of our students who would usually just be a statistic in large universities. In conclusion, the most important aspect of SEC I stand for is the voices of students and letting them know that their voices are heard.",
            "Question 8": "Times of failure are times in my life that I reflect on when I need to figure out areas of improvement. One of those sad events is my failure in an electrical engineering competition where my team wasn\u2019t able to perform as much as we did, but I wouldn\u2019t truly say it's a failure. I started that journey knowing nothing about basic concepts/practices electrical engineering as well as coordination with other university students, but as the project timeline progressed I was able to pick up numerous new skills with regards to my discipline, and also know how to coordinate with my team and motivate others to attain success. I also learned how to understand my weaknesses and how to overcome them, since I was a freshmen with no coding background I knew that I couldn\u2019t contribute from the software side but I made sure in my coming semesters (and breaks)I would make sure to invest myself with programming languages(to a certain level of mastery).",
            "Question 9": "I took this machine learning class on a whim from a newly acquainted friend which was a big step for me since machine learning was never in my radar for specialization. Despite the fact that it was a demanding and tedious course, I enjoyed every bit of it, where I was fascinated by how much of all the technology is created using machine learning and how much more could be done. Everytime we cover a topic that delved into the cutting edge, all the fatigue or stress I had from the day vanishes in pursuit of coming up with a solution(although a bit too naive) to those challenges. And when the time for a final project came around, I was excited to see the knowledge to be applied for real world application as well as an opportunity to increase my teamwork, coordination and technical skills. By the end of the semester it felt like yesterday when the person I was sitting next to for the previous class suggested taking the machine learning class with them."

As someone who went through a million \u201cdream career\u201d phases since pre-school, I would never have imagined that I would have chosen engineering. I was first introduced to Engineering when my nerdy cousin encouraged me into participating in LEGO League in Middle School. Although I forced myself to hate the whole aspect of building robots/programming, I quickly fell in love with the competition and found my passion for Engineering. I want to help encourage others into finding an \u201cinner passion\u201d for Engineering as I did, whether it's through hands-on events with robots or educating high schoolers about the many engineering majors available to choose from. Creating awareness towards Engineering is personally meaningful as it helps encourage students like me to realize a career that they wouldn\u2019t have originally considered.",
            "Question 8": "I like to tell everyone (especially my English teachers) that English isn\u2019t my first language. Writing essays has always been my enemy in high school as I always struggled to find the right words in my sentences. However before I entered high school, I never received an essay grade below 100 until I took AP English I. When my AP English teacher gave me my first essay grade, I thought I had a heart attack when I saw the failing grade. The entire walk back home consisted of many salty tears dripping on the 60 I received. Still in disbelief the next day, I decided to confront my English teacher on why I deserved an A. When I confronted her after class, she immediately asked me to sit down next to her and pull out my essay. Then and there, she showed me in detail the mistakes I made when writing that essay, along with tips to help me improve the current and future essays I wrote. After the session, I realized the amount of improvement that was needed in my writing skills, along with confronting my concerns to those who can help me understand them and improve upon them.",
            "Question 9": "Although Lifeguarding and I have a bittersweet relationship, Lifeguarding overall has given me memorable memories as well as life lessons that I hope to hold onto as time passes. When I first began lifeguarding, I didn\u2019t realize how vital teamwork was until I first dove into the water to save a life. On my fourth day at work as a lifeguard, I spotted at the corner of my a eye a little boy drowning in the deep end with no parents in sight. My adrenaline kicked in as my body jumped into the water and I swam the fastest I could until I reached the child. Once I grabbed the child, all my teammates rushed out to assist me, and all of them helped me to focus on the save and getting the child safely out of the water. Once I was out, I received many praises and words of encouragement from my other lifeguarding friends as well as the public which made me realize the satisfaction as well as enjoyment when lifeguarding. Although Lifeguarding may involve painful training and many sunburns, the happiness that came out of my first save and my encouraging friends make Lifeguarding bearable and rewarding!"

            "Question 8": "I found myself navigating many newfound challenges at the beginning of my college career. Leaving a place that I was comfortable in, and moving eight hours across the state created many internal struggles that had an effect on my schoolwork. I began my freshman fall semester with good grades that began to decline as the semester went on. I often found myself procrastinating on work and I had a lack of motivation to make myself better. Entering finals week, I did not have confidence in myself, and I crammed a semester's worth of work into a few days. When exam scores came back, I was not satisfied with my grades, and I even failed a few exams. At the beginning of winter break, I felt like I had failed. I spent my winter break rethinking how I would go about my spring semester. This semester, I feel as though my motivation has drastically increased.

As an upperclassmen, I was able to put myself into a position of leadership and rectify the issues that our previous upperclassmen had caused. Everyday, I entered practice with a positive attitude and I worked to better myself as a golfer. I led by example and soon I saw the rest of the team following in my footsteps. As a team, we set our goals high and wished to compete at the highest level possible by the end of the academic year. We watched as our persistence and dedication paid off at the district and regional tournaments. Soon, we found ourselves advancings to the Texas state championship. As the season progressed, I was able to watch my determination pay off. I realized the importance of leadership and setting your goals high."

The customer interactions helped me see the world from many different perspectives, as each customer had a distinct background and a unique story to tell. Even if our interactions were sometimes brief, being a server taught me much about socialization and connecting with people. I find connecting with the customers to be the most rewarding part of the job because, at the end of the day, you know you made an impact, even if it\u2019s small."

My parents were furious at me and that is when everything hit me at once, I felt like a failure. I hated the feeling, and it made me hate myself. My parents came to College Station to talk to me about how I was feeling. While they were talking to me my dad said something that changed my perspective of myself. He said, \"If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it because they are the ones that get stuff done\". This quote made me realize I was a lazy person who does not get stuff done. I did not want to be that kind of person, I wanted to be someone that people came to, I wanted to be a busy person.

After procrastinating on the project it suddenly was two weeks before the competition and only the base of the robot was finished. We got our heads in the game and started creating the perfect robot to do the tasks in the competition. We came up with a forklift design that would be able to pick up the cones and place them down with ease. A day before the competition, our robot's code was suddenly not working. One of my teammates and I decided to stay after school for about four hours to finish our robot and the code. On the day of the competition, we put our robot in the competition and came out in second place. It was a fantastic experience and definitely the most enjoyable project I have ever been a part of."

Events such as the Career Fair give students a taste of the corporate world. Sometimes in the \u201creal world,\u201d it is more about who you know than what you know that will set you apart from others, and such events help network with people in the field. Also, what I find rather rewarding from talking with recruiters from large companies that come on campus is that many of them, as Aggies, have been through the same process that we have been through and can be of much guidance.

I began playing Tennis when I was ten years old back in South America, and when I returned to Texas, I had the opportunity to join the JV team during my first year. I decided to try out the sophomore year with a friend for the Varsity team, but we still needed to make it. By the second time I tried out, we were deep in the pandemic, and I had lost confidence in my skills from a large gap, inability to play, and some hardships in my family. Nevertheless, I gave it all a second time and could not make it into the team. I decided to stop playing for a while and figure out something else to do. Then, with encouragement from my fathers, I started martial arts with Kung Fu and got my purple belt by the time I graduated from high school. Although I felt a little down when I saw my school\u2019s Varsity Team win state, I could move on and find something else to do. From my training, I would learn to find balance through meditation and have some personal growth I would not have elsewhere. I learned from my failure and found a better purpose.",

Initially, I worked as a cashier and was shy with other coworkers; it took some time to open up, and everything went more smoothly when I did. I became close with my managers and started taking longer shifts in more complex tasks to see them more often. I came to a point where I covered so many night shifts that I had to slow down to keep up with my schoolwork. Nevertheless, I would learn so much about teamwork and client service there that I would have probably done it for free\u2014leaving Chipotle was more challenging than I thought, as the people there had become like a second family to me.

In middle school and high school even though my parents didn't force me to have amazing grades. I was peer pressured into studying harder. All the results that I have received so far have been a result of hard work, anxiety, panic - I was never smart. After, I came here I realized how much I failed to take care of myself. Leaving for class almost an hour before it starts just because I was worried I would be late, not skipping class even when I was sick. Taking meals only when I felt hungry, my sleep schedule improper. Now I am starting to take care of myself so much that I have become a morning person. I have making my eating schedule better, and more importantly exercise to make myself tired.

More importantly I enjoyed working to create a tangible project, that I could look back in the future. I can actually prove that I have done something with my time. For me the most fun projects were those from my high school Spanish class, my senora wanted something colorful and artistic and I felt my ideas expand with that.

Given a huge influence on my decision to go towards the biomedical path came from DI Saturday, I also want to be part of someone else\u2019s decision-making process. This being said, the second pillar of SEC is the most important to me. SEC does a really good job of making the organization a tool for both engineers outside and inside the organization which keeps students engaged within the school and their majors. Lastly, I believe a huge part of bringing awareness to engineering is to meet people within your discipline. From all I\u2019ve seen from SEC so far, this organization will allow me to do just that.",
            "Question 8": "My most recent failure comes from a class here. I had never been the type to fail a class or even score below a B. Then comes MATH 152, a class I really thought was going to be my \u201cGPA booster\u201d of the semester. It was also the semester I was finally going to get to ETAM, so a lot was riding on my grade. After a well-fought semester, I realized I wasn\u2019t going to save my grade. It was extremely discouraging just to fail a class, and then to realize I pushed myself back an entire semester of ETAM. Even though my first instinct was \u201cengineering is definitely not for me\u201d, I decided to just make a plan and I realized with summer classes and some heavy-load semesters my small mistake had an easy fix. Even though this might seem like such a miniscule thing to write about, it truly did throw me off and discouraged me to keep going. Besides teaching me no math class here was going to be a \u201cGPA booster\", I learned failure is something you can easily bounce back from, given the right mindset and drive to accomplish a set goal.",
            "Question 9": "One of the things I\u2019ve enjoyed the most from work has been teaching little kids how to dance. While I do enjoy the dance aspect of it, what I mainly like about teaching is the impact you have. Young kids are like sponges. They absorb everything you tell them and express it as they keep growing within a discipline. It is also so interesting to see how curious kids are since a lot of things are brand new to them. A lot of questions would have me stunned sometimes and made me remember what it was like to be discovering things for the first time. I was really excited in the informational when the K-12 program was mentioned. It would be something I would be super interested in participating in. While I had an opportunity to teach kids through movement, this would give me the opportunity to teach them something that makes me excited for the future, which will hopefully inspire them to pursue a career within this area too."

A future where I\u2019m one of the only people trying to drive my surroundings forward sounds extremely lonely, and whenever I envision a bright future, I picture an instance with many people by my side. To work towards the future I envision, I want to work to create opportunities for the engineers around me. By doing so, I hope to help foster innovation towards more intense problems, and in my particular case, I hope to foster innovation to make space travel more efficient.",
            "Question 8": "My most recent failure was not keeping a 4.0 in my first semester of college. Leaving high school, I felt that I ended up losing opportunities because I wasn't as disciplined as I should've been early on. Things like merit scholarships and automatic admission felt impossible to me because I was lazy when those around me were working hard, and I decided that I didn't want my college experience to be like my high school one. My goal was a 4.0 throughout my academic career, but things simply didn't go according to plan.\nThe way I go about reacting to my problems is by reflecting on what I could have done better, and moving on with my life. As upset as I was about letting my GPA drop, I didn't have time to linger on that failure as I needed to put effort into the new semester and my further ambitions. So I reflected on my shortcomings, which I concluded to be my slacking studying near the time of finals, and moved on. I know I'll have more opportunities in front of me despite this failure, and I'm focused on capitalizing on those future experiences as they arise.",
            "Question 9": "A large part of what's defined who I am today is by working alongside my crazy career and startup-oriented friends and pushing myself to grow with them. As my friends are all often deep in their projects, a large part of us hanging out is just doing work, or a \"build session\" as they call it. Even though I haven't always been as crazy as my friends, I'm learning to love working and exploring my interests as a way of furthering myself and the things around me.\nWhen we meet up, we often work in a Starbucks. We don't always talk, but there's something about being surrounded by people who're all trying to move forward which makes work feel fun despite not always being interesting.\nI love the idea of moving toward a large goal because it makes almost every part of my life feel like a part of a process that becomes more fun as time passes. These small experiences where I'm just sitting at a laptop feel like some of the best times of my life because I know I'm moving toward a future that I'm passionate about."

            "Question 8": "As part of my ROTC special organization, each year we participate in a competition called Best Ranger Competition (BRC). BRC consists of multiple events that test military tactics and skills, and if you pass all of the events you are awarded the Rudder's pin, a distinguished and coveted award. Last year I passed all of the events up until shooting, where I shot below the standard. At first, I was devastated, because up until that point I had worked very hard to earn my pin and wanted it so that I could prove myself within the organization. However, I learned over time that I actually had become obsessed with success; I was putting too much emphasis upon and pride in succeeding in BRC. Failing allowed me to relax and enjoy my training within the organization more, and it helped me refocus my worth into more permanent things than an award.

In order to pass the time and also build connections with my customers, I would converse with them over many things, such as where they had lived or where they were working. I really enjoyed the work because I was able to build relationships with the people I worked for; being personable and being able to listen to how people were doing or hear stories from their time in service was what made the job worthwhile to me. Any work where I can relate with the people I serve and build a connection with them is worthwhile to me."

            "Question 8": "I got a 62 on my chemistry midterm. I was discouraged, and, more importantly, disappointed. I was mainly disappointed in myself because it was clear that my own lack of studying and preparation was the reason for my failure. However, for some reason, this failure actually turned into an opportunity.\nI decided to take ownership of my grades and put in the extra effort to do better. I started to ask more questions and attend office hours. I started to study consistently and put in longer hours every week. I worked on my time management skills as well as minimizing any distractions.\nWhat I learned from this experience is that failure is an opportunity to grow. By taking responsibility for my own learning and working as hard as I could, I was able to get a 93 on my final, and raise my grade to an \u2018A\u2019 . This lesson will stay with me and I will learn to apply it to all aspects of my life, not just academics.

What made this experience so enjoyable was the opportunity to put my problem-solving skills to the test and work with a team of talented individuals towards a common purpose.\nThe competition required us to analyze data, develop recommendations, and present our findings to a panel of experts. This was a unique challenge, and I had no experience or expertise in the industry we were studying. However, through interacting with my teammates and putting our collective intelligence together, I was able to broaden my perspective and gain valuable insights into not only the industry, but also different methods of approaching a problem.\nIn addition to the intellectual challenge, I also enjoyed the sense of camaraderie and teamwork that came from working with my team. It didn't feel like work even though we brainstormed and researched for several hours everyday. This bond that we created took the pressure of competition off our shoulders, so, when the time to present our solution came, we had total confidence in our ability to present.\nOverall, the case competition was a unique and rewarding experience that allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills, interact with a diverse group of individuals, do something outside of my comfort zone, and win 2nd place."

            "Question 7": "The SEC's pillar of increasing engineering awareness through its programs and awareness, specifically related to mental health, is the most meaningful to me due to its often understated importance. Because highly ranked institutions like TAMU bring many talented and often overconfident students to compete over getting specific majors in ETAM, it can cause a lot of stress and self-image issues if these students are unable to immediately excel to the same degree they did in high school while simultaneously transitioning to a new environment. I'm proud to be an student A&M when we stand together for Silver Taps, but also flinch when I hear the number of engineering student suicides. You as a person are more than the summation of your resume and, as someone who has dealt with expanding my identity past school, am glad that the issue is a focus of a large student organization like the SEC.",
            "Question 8": "Before coming to A&M, I was planning attend UT Austin for Electrical Engineering due to its emphasis on teaching practical skills in classes. With the top 6% rule, and high performance at Texas public schools, I had always assumed my acceptance into the schools program guaranteed, but this ended when my dad's job took our family to India. Living in India during covid-19 (perpetual online school) negatively impacted my grades and eliminated the opportunity of auto-admission through class rank. Demoralized, I returned to Houston for my senior year to finish my IB diploma and face application season with sporadically timed extracurriculars, 3 different types of transcripts, and a general lack of confidence in my ability to perform as a student. After my rejection and the frustration that ensued, I came to the understanding that the rejection irked me so much, because it directly contrasted with how I saw myself. I wouldn't be defined by a school that didn't recognize my efforts day to day, and attended TAMU with a chip on my shoulder. At A&M I have achieved Dean's Honors Roll, a grant to prototype an improved AEBS system, participated in organizations and hackathons, and plan to continue looking forward.",
            "Question 9": "During the TamuHack, my team tried to automize the data scraping of invoices for small-medium sized companies through ai or ocr, which was my capability level as a majority of my coding experience prior had come from ENGR 102. Even us joining the Hackathon was on the spur of the moment because I thought the idea of being driven completely on a project you had come up with 40 hours exciting and challenging. Despite losing, I learned a lot about me and my friends as teammates, and my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to larger projects. I think the world of computer science is endlessly competitive and I have started accepted there will always be people more adept at whatever specialties I choose to pursue, but despite this I still am endlessly intrigued by the capabilities of coding. During the hackathon I had total confidence that I would be able to create what I had set out to do, which was weird because there are not a lot of paths that allow for that. I am thankful for the trailblazers that have allowed me to peak into the window of the technological world without feeling overwhelmed, but instead extremely excited."

            "Question 8": "I had an internship abroad in Cyprus where I did research on manufacturing with very expensive equipment and machinery. I had to 3d print with steel a machine part for a boat. I spent days drawing an exact model to the millimeter and printed it only to realize I forgot to take into account the thickness of the wire itself when it melted as well as heat warp. I froze because my deadline was in three days to give the part to the client. It was extremely overwhelming that I was in another country with 1 job and I failed it. However, these frantic thoughts catalyzed a lot of personal growth. What was I going to do about it? I got back on the software and spent hours revising my model taking into account what I did wrong and making it better. Once this last push was done, a perfect replica was printed exact to within 1 mm. This ordeal taught me how to fight through any obstacle to deliver not only the expected solution but an improved solution. This taught me that with the right approach, a failure can yield a better result than expected. Despair in these scenarios is a choice, you can always do something about a failure.",

I love working for this organization because the people are very friendly and intelligent and the small things such as banter that goes along with working for a beautiful cause is extremely rewarding. Additionally, the knowledge gained from this was enriching to the mind. As engineers we are trained to perfect things on paper, but the implementation always yields problems such as wood warp, rot, rusted materials, etc. Figuring out these problems with a diverse group of smart people taught me things about the hands on issues that can only be gained from experiences like these.

The SEC with its industry nights, DI Saturdays, engineering career fairs, EnVision, and TREC, gives students opportunities to gain experience and knowledge about the different engineering disciplines. Other opportunities can arise when we get the chance to network with industry professionals with chances to get internships, and through EnVision fosters the professional advancement of engineering students even before college starts. This pillar means the most to me because the importance of advancing professionally is stressed to every engineering student and is especially important to me because I have seen my cousins struggle in getting a job post-graduation because they didn't have opportunities to network and internship experience. The fact that SEC has made it its mission to help engineering students to do this is extremely beneficial.",
            "Question 8": "A time I failed at something was during the SAT\u2019s where I would continuously take practice tests, study, do practice problems, and go to SAT tutoring sessions however I could not break into above a 1450 score. I tried different studying techniques such as Pomodoro, color coding, handwriting notes, drawing pictures, and practicing over and over. When I took my third SAT and still got a 1420, lower than my 2nd SAT score, after a year of continuously practicing and studying I was very frustrated. I had stress from my parents to do better, the school and class workload to keep my GPA up, and the stress of college applications. I felt like a failure. I started researching other alternatives to the SAT and found the ACT, a more math and science based standardized test. I would always score close to perfect on the math section of the SAT but the reading and writing sections would always bring me down so I took a few practice tests for the ACT. I used all my different studying techniques and started to think more positively about it.

Before the hackathon the only language we knew was Python from engineering 102. In the beginning of the hackathon, we had no idea how to even attempt to solve the challenge given to us because we had never coded a website or app before. This was our first hackathon. After 5 hours of being lost, we went to a workshop hosted by TAMU hack, and we learned how to approach coding a website. After learning what languages to use etc, we started to watch a lot of videos on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and on how to apply these languages to create a website. Coding and working towards finishing our project in time was a lot of fun as we could see how we were getting closer to our finished product. It was really fulfilling to see the growth, within 24 hours we went from not knowing anything to learning 3 coding languages and creating a website."

I never imagined I'd be confronted with a problem in this area.\nHowever, contrary to my belief, I was so engrossed in the extra-curricular activities in Grade 10 that I unwittingly succumbed to procrastination. My performance in the pre-board exam was not as per expectations. I had no idea how to deal with my teacher and parents.\nIn 20 days, I'd have my final board exams. Somehow, I mustered the courage and informed my parents about this. They were taken aback when they heard about my poor performance at first, but they believed in me and attempted to make me feel at ease. Their faith in me boosted my self-esteem and made me stronger. The first step was to make my schedule more disciplined. I used to get up early every day to practice for at least two hours, and I began meditating to improve my focus and retention power. I eliminated all sources of distraction, such as video games. I gradually regained my willpower and confidently took my exam. I passed the final exam with flying colors and secured 96%.

The competition involved an industrial simulation to design a Space Settlement that would shield solar radiation and reduce global warming. I was heading the Operation and Infrastructure part of the project. I conducted a complete trade analysis on the two prospective locations regarding the positioning of the settlement to perform its task. It was critical to carefully select the criterion because it was a key deciding element.

Therefore, I was confident that I should go to the State Science Fair. But under the eyes of many, my name did not get called. I cannot believe the fact and cried to my teachers about it. After many talks, I realized that I did not present all my work clearly. I found that there are so many people with really good projects that mine is just a big fish in a small pond that got thrown into an ocean. I realized that I have not taken this as seriously as I thought I was and that there are many others that spend countless time working on their projects.

Therefore, the vast opportunities to advance in the professional world offered by SEC are most in-line with my personal vision and goals.",
            "Question 8": "During high school, I was under the impression that my classes required little effort and would opt to play video games instead. This only worked for so long until AP Tests came around. My lack of preparation and knowledge would lead me to receive low scores and earn a failing grade, rendering the year useless. It was disheartening and angering, looking back, knowing how much time I spent avoiding classwork because I could\u2019ve done so much more to achieve the score I wanted. I learned to always be prepared because you never want to regret what could\u2019ve been. This has led me to perform better in my classes at university. I allocate proper time to study for my exams and quizzes along with prioritizing items to study more efficiently. Because of the lessons, I learned from my past failures, I was able to get back on track and have my scores reflect my efforts.",
            "Question 9": "On the wrestling team in high school, I was surrounded by people that wanted to help everyone improve and motivated one another to push ourselves harder. We endured many obstacles which taught me how to work and communicate with others, lead a group, and sharpen my ability to self-motivate and set goals. We improve our cardiovascular capabilities by starting every workout with a 30-minute run. Every day I would strive to run more miles within those 30 minutes. I started with a 10-minute mile pace and proceeded to reach a 7:30 mile time. A memorable moment is when we ran a drill called King of the Mat, in which you aim to win as many matches as possible consecutively until you lose. In addition to practice and drills, we would travel and compete in tournaments, and we managed to become district champions. All these experiences helped me bond with my teammates and created moments that when I look back, reminds me of a quote- \u201cyou reap what you sow\u201d. The hard work I put in helped me better myself and improved my ability to connect with others, lead my team, and set goals to sow a more fruitful future."

Fostering the professional advancement of engineering students is critical to producing quality engineers for the problems of tomorrow. The education we receive in class is amazing, however, alone it is not enough to prepare students for careers. Professional I have had engineering education starting from high school, and now classes like ENGR 102 and PHYS 216. I loved the classes, and I learned a lot. Although I realized recently that I have no clue how to talk to a representative for an engineering company. After speaking to my friends, it seems that this issue does not just affect me. I would love to help others learn professional skills, and learn them myself. Engineering isn\u2019t just the calculations can do or the programs we can write, it is also the way we work with other engineers to find solutions.",
            "Question 8": "I have never grown more from a mistake than this last semester. I took 8 classes and earned 3 A\u2019s 4 B\u2019s and a C. The C was worth 4 credit hours so it canceled out the A\u2019s and I earned a 3.0 GPR last semester. I was very disappointed with myself, and I am now on probation for one of my scholarships. I took time over the break to reflect on what I could do to improve this semester and to focus on my mental health. Within the short month we had, I visited with a therapist and found that I had undiagnosed depression that may have affected me academically. This semester I have changed my study habits and started treatment. Now I am a week ahead in all of my classes, and I have gotten much better at balancing school with the Corps. While it would have been nice to have done better academically last semester, I am grateful for the lessons I learned.",
            "Question 9": "My favorite work to do is developing something from an idea to something I can see and interact with. It is why I want to become an engineer. In high school, I would design, and 3D print little things to put around my room to make life a little easier. I would do the same with circuits and sculptures I would make. Recently though, I have started to appreciate work that does not have immediate results. Things like working at McDonald\u2019s or volunteering with my church. As I work do these things day to day, I cannot see the benefit or any improvement. However, over a longer period of time, say a month, I find huge benefits and growth. This doesn\u2019t make the work any easier, but it does allow me to appreciate the process."

This gives A&M Engineering students an edge once they graduate. All these events planned out by SEC provide a strong backbone for the knowledge learned within classes. While engineering awareness is essential, I feel that most people already understand this significance, especially if they are already engineering students. Therefore, I believe that fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students within the College of Engineering is the most critical pillar of the SEC Mission Statement.",
            "Question 8": "A time I failed at something was not getting the GPA I wanted last semester, my first semester at A&M. As a freshman, I believed that if I put in the same amount of work as I had in high school, I would be fine, and definitely get above the 3.75 cutoffs for engineering students. Looking back, I realize that I came into college with the wrong mindset. I should\u2019ve accepted that college was a completely different experience from high school, and that required more work and a deeper understanding of the content presented in lectures. From this experience, I have learned to be much more proactive with studying right from the start of the semester. I watch pre-lecture videos explaining topics, attend Week-In reviews, and go to SI sessions. I feel like all these steps will lead me to a much better understanding of the material which will be reflected in my scores throughout the semester.",
            "Question 9": "I recently picked up the art of crochet as the Covid-19 pandemic arose. I initially started crocheting as a way to relax - some people choose to bake, some choose to exercise, and some decide they want to read; for me, that was crochet. As I looped through my vibrant maroon yarn, I could appreciate the dedication and amount of work involved to create a scarf or beanie from scratch. Not only is this a time-consuming process, but each weave must also be meticulously crafted to create the desired article. Being able to donate all my creations to cancer patients drove me to work harder and as efficiently as possible to produce the best product. I thought it would be a good way to make a small impact in my community, especially in the tough times brought along with Covid. Even though I started small, I was able to learn important life lessons which I will continue to carry with me through college and beyond. I was also able to gain confidence because even though I am not an art-inclined person, I successfully accomplished outstanding results."

In my opinion, being ready for the professional world and learning how companies work and what they do is just as important as the classes we need to complete for our degrees. By participating in professional development the engineers at TAMU are able to succeed in their careers after graduation. Additionally, interacting with companies also helps students network and create connections that help with internships, co-ops, and job opportunities. Therefore, I think working on professional development during college is one of the best ways of setting yourself up for success post-graduation, which is why it matters the most to me, and being part of the engineering development committee will best fit my interests.",
            "Question 8": "I failed to get an internship for the Summer of 2023. During the fall semester, as many companies were opening their applications for internships, one of my main goals was to land one for the summer. As a freshman in college, I knew this would not necessarily be easy, but I tried hard to write the best possible responses to application questions, and prepare for different types of technical questions. Despite this, I didn\u2019t get one. However, I learned that others simply had more under their belt; they were more qualified. Whether it be what classes they had done, previous internships they had, or even their classification. I knew I had to do more to stand out, so I have started working towards completing the PCAP certification (Certified Associate in Python Programming).",

Initially, I was skeptical about how I would fit in in a sports environment since that wasn't something I had previously been inclined to do. However, I found this job challenging and rewarding in many different ways. Not only did this job encourage me to learn more about sports brands and types of gear, but it also taught me how to work in unfamiliar settings. Furthermore, due to the pandemic, it was hard to interact with many people outside of Zoom. Being able to go to work three times a week was something I started to look forward to and enjoyed. I expanded my knowledge on how to interact with and help people. Here, I wasn't talking to friends, but co-workers and customers, so I learned how to proceed in a more professional setting. My first job has made me learn more than I ever would have thought, and I feel fulfilled with my choice of pushing myself outside my comfort zone."

During the summer and throughout my senior year, I dedicated many hours to practicing in the mornings, during band class, after school, and late at night. I even took school instruments home to continue practicing over Thanksgiving break. Although I made it to All-Area, I was just one chair away from making state. The results were initially hard to accept, but the support from my family and friends helped me appreciate what I had achieved and put things into perspective.

During one of these weeks, known as Angle Tree Week, we had campers from troubled homes come to camp. At first, I thought I would need to really impact these kids and put much more effort to keep these kids safe while having fun. But as time went on, I realized that they had made a larger impact on me than I had ever expected. These kids had loving hearts and a yearning to learn and be a part of something bigger than themselves. While I wanted to teach them, I learned so much about how to be more compassionate and caring unconditionally."

Joining a university with a large student population, while offering many opportunities, can be overwhelming and some may even feel lost, both academically and socially. Embarking on an engineering education is not an easy path, and for most, myself included, requires the support of many others to complete the journey successfully. Representation by a student council within a large college campus can offer a sense of security, a feeling of shared identity with others and a reservoir of resources in times of need. If the fundamental need for representation is not met, other areas of SEC\u2019s mission, crucial in supporting engineering students, would not be as effective.",

Another person may believe it a failure to not make it to area finals during your junior year volleyball tournament. Yes, this was me, too. Yet, others may think they are going to be a failure when they do not get the high grades anticipated in the first year of engineering at Texas A&M University. Yep, me again. My parents talked a lot about failure during my years under their roof after reading the book \"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\" by Carol Dweck. They paid me $50 dollars to read it the summer before my sophomore year of high school. In a nutshell, the book tells stories and gives psychological data on the ability to change our thinking about success and failure. Now, when I \u201cfail,\u201d I TRY to remind myself of the words from my dad (he carries this quote from Winston Churchill in his wallet), \u201cSuccess is not final. Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d And, I press on.",

First, as a sales associate at a retail clothing store and then as a waitress at a small restaurant. My retail and dining experiences were not all pleasurable as I did not enjoy matching clothes for customers, folding clothes for displays and dealing with an unhappy customer because the food was not prepared to their specification. However, I did learn some valuable skills. I learned to speak to people that I did not know and to ask, \u201cHow can I be of help to you today?\u201d I witnessed and was part of difficult conversations involving unhappy customers and fellow employees and learned to be in uncomfortable situations. Other types of \u201cwork\u201d I have greatly enjoyed; I was part of the prom planning committee in high school. We spent months getting ready for the students\u2019 biggest night of the year. This was a lesson in collaboration, dedication and relationships that I will treasure for a lifetime. I truly enjoy working as part of a team."

Entering Texas A&M, I desired the same meaningful purpose, helping represent and unite the student body. I quickly found the Freshman Class Council, Fish Co, as this opportunity. Throughout my time in the Class Councils, the representative body of the Classes of Texas A&M, I served as the Director of Outreach for Fish Fest and the Director of Logistics for Pull Out Day. In these roles, I learned the ins and outs of working with various stakeholders on campus, from the Department of Transportation Services to the Association of Former Students.

            "Question 9": "During my time in Class Councils as an Outreach Director, I constantly reached out to organizations across campus to get their involvement in our Freshman Class Tradition: Fish Fest. As we were in a lockdown I brought it upon myself to create a virtual component for Fish Fest over discord including those attending A&M from home. During this time I was meeting with different organizations across campus through zoom meetings to discuss their potential involvement in Fish Fest and if they would be interested in carrying out the online components through discord. I worked hard to make sure the organizations had everything they needed to carry out mini-games on the discord server even going as far as to make a step-by-step guide on how to use discord. Through this outreach, I found enjoyment in working with so many people from all sorts of organizations across campus, and I would love to put forth my efforts to do something like that again."

Many of my friends have no desire to go to a career fair, or secure internships/co-ops to build they're resumes. They don't understand the value in having great resume experience or the knowledge you gain by taking advantage of those experiences. Many students undervalue the opportunities the SEC and the College of Engineering provide.

            "Question 8": "Last semester I applied for a men\u2019s organization I felt I might fit into based on the discussions I had with all the guys. Personally, I\u2019ve had a lot of poor experiences that make it hard for me to open up and be myself around people I don\u2019t know. I knew that if I wanted to be in a men\u2019s organization, I wanted it to be because I got along with the guy\u2019s because of who I really am. I made it through the first, second, and third round of cuts. I decided that I would interview with two of the guys I hadn\u2019t spoken to before and really stretch myself. Sadly, I didn\u2019t make the last round of cuts, I failed at making it into an organization I was passionate about and opened myself up for. This experience helped me grow as I learned the importance of opening yourself up to people and leaving my comfort zone. If I closed off my personality I probably wouldn\u2019t have made it past the second round of cuts. Additionally, signing up for an interview with two guys I\u2019ve never spoken to before isn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever do prior to this experience.",
            "Question 9": "Personally, I\u2019ve really enjoyed working out alone as of late. I think that the challenge of it all is enjoyable. One to two times per week you\u2019re attempting to push yourself past the barrier you were at last week and continually improve upon yourself. Additionally, I believe it requires a lot of discipline to stay consistent. It\u2019s very easy to fall out of a schedule and substitute the required time for other things such as hanging out with friends, or going out and partying. You really have to maintain a level headspace and dedicate yourself to a goal in order to achieve it in the gym. Working out has made me a much more focused person, and has helped me learn how to drive myself to do things I may not want to do everyday to become more disciplined. Overall, I generally enjoy work that helps me build upon myself, whether mentally, physically, or professionally."

I was altitude sick, tired, and ready to completely give up while tears streamed down my face. My confidence in completing the hike was defeated. But, unfortunately for me in that moment, giving up was not an option, as I was not allowed to just leave and find my way down. I was forced to keep going and persevere. After I felt better and successfully completed the 5 day hike, I took a minute to reflect on my journey. If I would've been allowed to give up in that moment, I would've and I wouldn't have the confidence and mindset I gained from that week. Although this story is not a complete story of failure, it almost was, and it taught me just as much. Now, I know that if I persevere I can do anything I set my mind to and to never give up.

As much as I have not enjoyed coding because it is so foreign to me, there were times doing my homework that I was thoroughly having fun. Every time my code would run, the feeling of success was so rewarding, and when it wouldn't quite run correctly, fixing my code was like a puzzle that needed to be put together and I couldn't wait until it would finally work.

We one time all met up on a Saturday and worked for a straight 5 hours and had barely any progress from when we started. The part that was so enjoyable was when we finally figured out what to do and what we were doing wrong. Going through all the errors and mess-ups is what made the final product so special when the game worked because of how much time and effort we put in. Obviously, if we were to get the code right the first time trying it out without any sweat, it would've been a lot less work. But since we stayed together and kept going even after a lot of failures, it was very enjoyable and uplifting when we found our mistake."

The role of the Engineering Development Committee has drawn my interest. Furthermore, after listening to the team present, I understood how much I could learn from them in order to excel in my future career. The collaboration and teamwork required to put the events into action have demonstrated to me that this is an environment in which I can improve my communication, leadership, and professional skills. As a freshman, I used to wonder whether I was choosing the correct engineering discipline. Although they were not the most important factors in my decision, the industry nights and DI Saturday I attended were useful in determining my major. Nevertheless, being part of the team that organizes such useful events for freshmen engineers would be a great experience from which I could learn a lot.",
            "Question 8": "I've always wanted to compete at the highest levels of swimming. Almost every day throughout my freshman year of high school, I was constantly training. I was able to try out for the local national team. However, a terrible family incident and academic preparations kept me busy for a few months before the tryouts. A few months later, try-out sessions began, during which the coaches chose two or three swimmers from the club to tryout for the national team. When the results were announced, I understood my dream had been crushed and my chance was lost. I was disappointed, demotivated, and realized that my dream might not come true because of other life events. Finally, I recognized that some aspects of life are beyond my control and that I shouldn't blame myself because I put in the effort despite the circumstances. After some self-reflection, I realized that I had changed a lot as a result of this journey that I had before considered a total failure. I recalled instances when I acted differently than I would have, became more disciplined, and had a deeper understanding of myself.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer of last year, I chose to accept an internship with Dubai Refreshments, the local Pepsi Co. franchise in the UAE. I was thrilled to land my first internship and gain work experience. During my internship, I was assigned various tasks such as supervising a production line for hours, performing frequent quality checks on products, and collaborating with engineers and technicians from various disciplines to maintain industrial level utility machines. Over time, I gathered knowledge of the processes and procedures that a beverage must go through in order to be approved to quench the thirsts of countless consumers. I spent plenty of time understanding and connecting how many of the methods utilized to keep the process running smoothly were simple phenomena I had learned in prior years but adjusted to suit the operation. In addition, I am satisfied that I have learned a great deal about the food and beverage industry from all of the principal engineers, production managers, and quality assurance chemists. Additionally, it was shocking after witnessing the quantities of sugars used to make our soft drinks taste the way they do. Finally, it was a great opportunity to learn from these experts within the industry."

Through years of hard work and dedication, nothing makes a student happier than the feeling of being successful when they get their first job in the industry. The SEC provides many opportunities for students to network, make connections, and find their next internship or full-time position, which is one of the best resources available to engineering students. Professional development is something that is very closely connected to becoming successful in the industry, and while being a part of the SEC, I would absolutely love to help expand this department and provide more of such resources that would be beneficial to students when it comes to finding the right job for them. I personally am also looking for internships this summer, and I believe that the SEC career fairs have helped me tremendously by allowing me to become confident while speaking to industry professionals and sell myself through my resume and experience. Since this aspect of the SEC has helped me advance so much, I am very inclined to join the SEC and possibly create the same impact on other students as well!",
            "Question 8": "When I was in my junior year in high school, I was a part of DECA, where we created solutions to real world industry problems and presented them at competitions and conferences. At the time, I was competing in the product development sector, where I was assigned the task to make a presentation to present the life cycle of a product that I came up with. Because of procrastination, tight deadlines and extreme stress, I ended up focusing on small, insignificant details rather than the bigger picture, or the actual content of my presentation. Obviously, I didn't place at the competition, and this demotivated me tremendously. I saw that I was applying these same habits of procrastination and unhealthy perfection to my schoolwork and projects, and it was only making things worse. Obviously, I began to notice these patterns and decided to flip it around. At this time, our next season of DECA was around the corner, and I already knew which project I wanted to participate in. I began my planning weeks before I needed to, just to give me enough time in case I found any errors or came up with better ideas. I began to strengthen my overall project and its deeper impact before focusing on small, perfectionist details. By the end of the month, I thought I had an amazing project put together, weeks before it was supposed to be turned in. Giving myself enough time to prepare my project and be comfortable with changes, I was able to present it much more confidently and with ease, impressing the judges. Thankful to my change in work ethic, I was able to advance to the state and national level, making my inner self very proud. This one project taught me so much about my work ethic and little habits here and there that helped me improve myself and become who I am today.",
            "Question 9": "Only last week, my friends and I decided to participate in TAMUhack, a hackathon presented by Texas A&M, where students from different colleges came to compete in hacking challenges. At first, my friends and I were overwhelmed by the amount of people present at the hackathon. Along with being overwhelmed, we were also very confused about what to do since this was our very first one. After a couple hours passed by, we finally began on a \"project\": something very basic that even a middle-schooler could've coded. I was losing faith in our ability to get anything big done during this hackathon, but we decided to take our minds off of it and attend a Web Development workshop they were offering. Little did we know, this one 30-minute workshop taught us so much and gave us a flood of inspiration. As soon as we got back, we began planning the frameworks of our project and started working. In the beginning, we knew absolutely nothing. But eventually, after watching tons of tutorials, we were able to apply our newly learned knowledge to actually produce a website! The process of learning this was so fun for all of us, because it was all trial and error, but when it worked, we all were so excited! Plus, the thrill and satisfaction of learning new languages and actually getting them to work was such a nice feeling for all of us, especially since we only learned it a couple hours ago. This experience was definitely a huge learning curve for us, and even though we didn't win anything, my team and I were all so happy about leaving the hackathon with three new programming languages and web development tools under our belt!"

The term failure is something I struggled with accepting and looking back I can say I failed to appreciate the little victories always overlooking it for the next stage.\nTransitioning to college I always thought graduating from high school should be expected and not a celebratory event. I was constantly baffled by my friends' excitement and graduation parties and always told them I see this as normal and graduating college should be when you celebrate.\nThis view changed when I got into an accident on my way to my graduation and realized how easily high school could have been my final chapter. I learnt to appreciate the little victories in life that stayed with me through my early years in college. I celebrate every test I pass, every milestone in a group project and don't wait until the final result before I acknowledge mine or my teammates' hard work.",

Through compromise with other model nations, we solved world problems with everyone\u2019s best interests in mind. It was a formative experience, proving to me that despite differences, people from diverse belief systems can find common ground for the good of the whole.\nThe privilege of attending the Houston Area Model United Nations (HAMUN) conference and working amongst people whom I had never met was key in the development of my collaborative skills. Everyone had initial ideas which were believed to be good and right for all, but we found middle ground. By doing so, we reached resolutions; it taught me how to be diplomatic in my everyday dealings with people while also realizing that the good of the whole is greater than the interests of the one."

Through Texas A&M Engineering and the SEC, every engineer has impressive potential to do something great, though many students (myself included) feel so disconnected from this idea. I attribute this to people not being as successful as they can be because they need to be aware of what is possible. The opportunities we have around us are endless. But at the same time, many students feel lost in finding their way to the next aspect of their careers. So, with myself included, increasing engineering awareness through the SEC's programs and events feels like the glue sticking between people and their goals",
            "Question 8": "Recently, I have been getting more interested in online chess. I would always see people in front of my massive 600+ person lectures playing chess, so I decided that a bit of chess wouldn't hurt. Long story short, I got even more hooked than I could ever imagine. I watched Youtube videos, learned openings and tactics, and even listened to podcasts' chess games as the narrator says each move. While visiting home for the break, I brought this addiction to my dad. With all the infatuation with chess for the last couple of weeks, I thought my dad stood no chance. Quite the opposite ensued. I would find myself at multiple points realizing how many mistakes and traps I fell into. This continued until a sudden checkmate, followed by my dad's hysterical laughter. After studying the match, I left with a conclusion that resonated more profoundly than any game. In chess, the reason you lose is purely the outcome of your decision-making. You made every single move on the board and adapted to your circumstances. I've started to look at my problems in a similar light. While I know there can be external factors in life, I am constantly reaping what I sow, and a heart-crushing game of chess with my dad showed me that.",
            "Question 9": "The most memorable time in my recent life is spent at the gym. My workout split is comprised of 3 main parts, done twice a week, called \"push pull legs.\" In this workout split, you work out \"pulling\" muscles (back and biceps) on day one, \"pushing\" muscles (chest, triceps, and shoulders) on day two, and legs on day three. The cycle repeats (with rest days thrown in, of course). My favorite of the particular three days is \"push\" day. Quite bluntly, this is because it makes me look the most muscular. Only before push days do I take pre-workout. This mainly consists of caffeine, L-Citrulline, and other performance-enhancing effects to aid my workout. Like many others, the gym is a fantastic way to unwind and be physically active through a mentally taxing day at school. The most fun aspect of my push days is tracking my lifts and seeing progress. While it isn't easy to see daily gym progress in the mirror, the weights increase over time is fantastic. I love knowing that my pure consistency and hard work are paying off with a process I can track. Going to the gym gives me an outlet for progression, a concept humans constantly strive for."

            "Question 8": "When I was 7 years old, I was struggling to ride my bike. I didn't know how, and although my family was trying to teach me, I would fall repeatedly, so I said to myself I'm never giving up. I will ride my bike until I manage to excel at it, so I started riding and falling continuously until somehow, I managed to do it. This experience has shifted my life because, from that moment, I knew that I should never give up and keep trying even If I was wounded, bleeding, or putting myself at risk, so that the reward is deserved and, more importantly, satisfying. It helped me to succeed in my academic career especially when I was applying for the biggest scholarships in my country not knowing if I would attain that scholarship or not, and I kept trying until I gained the most prestigious scholarship in Saudi Arabia.

I'm still great at math and trying to be better at it each day, and I still enjoy solving math problems whenever I can as it makes my brain feel focused. Discussing math concepts and problems with my colleagues makes me feel that I'm accomplishing a lot of things at the same time.

If you ask a kid what they would like to be when they grow up, a lot of kids in lower-income communities will talk about their dream to be professional athletes or how they want to be online influencers, whereas kids in higher-income areas are more likely to say they want to be a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist.

The worst part was everyone in the class knew he cheated on all of his exams as he would always get strait-A\u2019s on his exams but when AP testing came around he would fail every single test. I was frustrated and upset, however, looking back now I realize that sometimes people who take the shortcut get ahead of people who do things the right way, but \u2018salutatorian\u2019 is just a title.

The importance of laying the concrete in these people's houses is a lot of people have dirt floors, and these floors make diseases and germs spread very easily, especially to mothers and kids who are in these homes all day. There were bugs everywhere and the tropical humidity made a few people pass out. But at the end of the trip, I remember looking and seeing the amount of work we had done. Seeing the effect of me and my team truly felt rewarding. Even though I hardly even knew the people I helped and will doubtfully ever see them again, just knowing that because of me their lives were improved made me feel so satisfied with my work.

            "Question 9": "At the end of my junior year of high school, I was assigned to make a catapult in my physics class. Using everything that we had learned throughout the year, we were to create a structure that had the ability to launch a tennis ball into targets at three different distances. I knew this was going to be no easy task, but I enjoyed the challenge and was excited to get to work. My group and I started brainstorming ideas and decided to divide up the work based on our personal skills. I\u2019ve always enjoyed taking measurements and making calculations, so I took over that aspect of the assignment. We eventually began building, but things did not exactly go as planned. Each launch, our tennis ball landed at a different spot, and we struggled to keep any consistency. Although originally frustrating, I enjoyed trying to figure out the root of the problem. With many, many trials and errors, we were finally able to fix the catapult and maintain an accurate launch. Throughout the process, I really enjoyed creating something from nothing and finally seeing all our hard work pay off."

            "Question 7": "I am most interested in the third pillar, fostering professional advancement for all engineering, because school and classes teach us the theoretical part of being an engineer. However, no class, at least I'm not aware if there is, teaches us how to be competitive, professional, and effective in a workplace as an engineer and a person. These aspects are left for students to figure out and look for those resources. I desire to improve resources for engineering students' competitiveness and professionalism here at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 8": "I was in the Corps of Cadets the first week of school, but quitted right after because I was scared, overwhelmed and saw it as too big of a time commitment. I now realize that I judged the program too early, and I had quit before starting. I didn't give it a fair chance, and there's a lingering question in my mind: what could happen if I gave it a chance? Where would I be right now? Who would my friends be? etc. I learned to try things even when you are scared because if you don't, If I don't, I might regret it later. I learned not to judge before giving something or someone a fair chance, and above all, I learned to be compassionate with myself. I hated myself for quitting the corps, it was not something I was proud of, but I have learned to understand and be compassionate with myself.",
            "Question 9": "I worked for AggieSat Laboratory on the ALARM Rover Project. What I enjoyed the most was working with a group of people who were as passionate as me about finding solutions. In my systems sub-team were four people, including me, but there were about 30 people as a project. There were electrical, mechanical, structure, computer science, electrical, systems, etc, sub-teams, and I was able to work with all of them. It was an enriching experience as I worked with my systems sub-team and collaborated with other sub-teams. As a systems engineer, I designed the navigation system for the rover based on research for the two-way ranging sensors and type and quantity of cameras for navigational vision and hazard identification using Ultra-Wideband. I worked with the electrical sub-team to develop power and energy budgets for navigation and sensing equipment. I also completed weekly meeting reports to keep track of advancements and plan the next tasking for next week."

I know first-hand how easy it is to get sucked into your work and I appreciate SEC's dedication to improving the well-being of the students. Engineers week is a notable event for engineers at this school because it allows us to have a distraction from the stress and work that we deal with every day. It is important to have reminders that there is more to life than work, which is also why the SEC\u2019s Envision is very important to me. The benefits that come from having an engineering degree can change lives, which is why it is vital to inspire the next generation of engineers. I know from experience that many kids lack exposure to engineering until they get to college, so it is exceptional that SEC grants so many kids this opportunity.",
            "Question 8": "Academics are important, I feel a lot of pressure to not only succeed but to be the best. My most significant academic failure was not being in the top 10 percent of my class, therefore losing eligibility for automatic admission to Texas Universities. At the time this was significant to me, I felt like I had wasted my time, and I regretted not applying myself more. I knew that engineering was a competitive field and that any engineering program is going to be full of people at the top of the class. This put a chip on my shoulder and made me realize that I couldn't change the past, but I could work harder and prove that I belong wherever I wanted. While I was working to form new study habits, I also gained an appreciation for living a healthy lifestyle. I started eating better and taking care of my body, which contributed to my success. Although I am still upset that I didn't apply myself in high school, I can still appreciate that I would not be here without failing first. I can incorporate this mindset into SEC, where I will strive to be the best I can be.",
            "Question 9": "I worked at a coding camp near my house where I taught K-12 kids a variety of tech subjects. It was a very unique experience because I met countless kids and parents. While I was working here I learned that I really enjoyed teaching, and it was great to see that I could inspire some kids to look into engineering careers. However it wasn\u2019t always easy, while there were a couple of kids that were really easygoing and interested, most kids were hard to motivate. I had to get really good at motivating the unmotivated and dealing with conflicts between students. During this experience I learned that the conflict between kids is not so different from the conflict between adults, the difference is kids are not afraid to express exactly how they feel about someone. I also had to learn patience, because the projects we worked on could be complicated, and each kid wanted to make their own thing, so I ended up co-creating numerous projects, while also trying to teach kids to be more independent. This experience has translated into my personal life, where I have become much more composed and better at dealing with conflict."

I find that the SEC's representative voice of all students is the most outstanding pillar, as the other two options cannot function independently of it. The aforementioned pillar is the most general of the three, with a widespread influence that spans the entirety of the student body. This may not seem important until you consider the rest of the pillars, which hold heavy importance but fall short in scope. If the SEC was not a representative voice of all students, increasing engineering awareness and fostering the professional development of students inside the Engineering College would be compromised. Additionally, acting as a representative means taking feedback from the representee. This pillar outlines the connection between the SEC and the student body and thus magnifies its importance.",
            "Question 8": "People often say that old habits die hard; I am not an exception to this proverb. Throughout high school, I brushed off failure with flimsy excuses. If I didn\u2019t do well on an assignment, I would tell myself that \u201cI didn\u2019t try my hardest\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t care about this assignment\u201d with no regard for consequences. I had the potential to be a straight-A student but fell short due to this habit. However, during my first semester of college, I decided to make a change for the better. Through hard work and dedication, I achieved a 4.0 GPA to begin my college career while simultaneously looking to join various organizations and labs. However, near the end of the year, I reverted to old habits. Due to my high scores on several tests throughout the year, I redeveloped my \"good enough\" mentality. During finals week, when other students were cramming to excel on their tests, I only aimed to maintain my grades. Although I succeeded in this goal, I realized upon reflection that I failed myself and my new standards. Due to this epiphany, I began putting effort into all my commitments and will continue to stand by this decision.",

After the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I reached out to MD Anderson Cancer Center to see if they had an open position for an intern, and they employed me on their immunotherapy platform. When I first entered the lab, the vast resources (physical and intellectual) enthralled me to no end. I also had access to some of the most brilliant minds in the medical world who actively supported my journey through the research science world. I was free to explore lab techniques and stockpiled information that I still use today in my current undergraduate research. The concept of work is the antithesis of fun to many. However, I was able to overcome this hurdle to find work that catered to my tastes and challenged my intellect."

Going to one of the biggest engineering schools in the country is a privilege, but it also means it can be hard to build an engineering community. That's what's so special about attending Texas A&M, and more specifically, SEC. The Student Engineering Council not only serves as a representative of engineers to those on the outside, but those on the inside as well. It provides a support base for those in the engineering community. For those overwhelmed by the size and prestige, SEC can make it feel a little smaller. Being in SEC is not only a way to meet other engineers but a collective group that shares the desire to make a change on campus and represent engineers with honor and merit.",
            "Question 8": "Last summer, I worked for Plains All American Pipelines. Throughout my time with Plains, I worked on various projects given to me by the president of my department. Being an engineer, I\u2019ve become used to working with specific instructions and clear expectations of my work. In my job, projects were a little more ambiguous and left to me to determine the most efficient way of accomplishing them. I feel I could\u2019ve done a better job of asking for help when I was confused about the parameters and expectations of my assignments. As someone who functions well in a group setting, it was out of my comfort zone to be completing tasks on my own. I wish I had been more open to asking for help and having follow up conversations with my boss. I could\u2019ve done my work better and more efficiently had I taken the time to clarify with those around me what was expected of me. Although I would say my job was an overall success, I think I failed at acknowledging where I was confused and taking action to clear it up. In the future, I\u2019ll be more willing to ask for help and clarification.",
            "Question 9": "During the first semester of college, I was in my hullabaloo U class that everyone has to take. At the start of the class we were given the task of creating and presenting a research project on one engineering topic or event. My team decided to do our project on nuclear power, specifically what happened at Chernobyl. I was personally responsible for providing the information on how nuclear power works and what goes on inside the average nuclear power plant. Hours of research turned into one of the most interesting and eye-opening experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Nuclear power has so much potential as a zero-emission energy source and is much cleaner than many energy options today. This project changed the way I look at the energy sector as well as how I look at my homework. Even a small research project for a zero credit hour class led me to the industry I\u2019m most passionate about and I hope to work in.

My sophomore year of highschool however, my team failed to make playoffs. This was a heartbreaking experience for me, especially after so much time and effort had been spent preparing for this. This took a toll on the rest of the team, with many members putting there head down and losing faith in the team. For me however, I couldn't accept it.

Because of this, the community truly relied on the work being done by this manufacturing unit. Being able to be a part of the work being done here was truly an amazing experience as I really felt like I was making an impact on people with the work being done.

Another part of my job, however, is to be a counselor for freshmen who are struggling. Because I was in their position one short year ago, I have the fortunate ability to provide a lot of pertinent advice. Last semester I recognized that one cadet was struggling academically and with mental health in general. I pulled her aside and gave her some advice on her situation as well as encouraged her that she was doing a good job and was an admirable cadet. After our conversation she told me she appreciated the advice and was much more motivated. In the week following I noticed a change in her energy level and I felt more motivated knowing that I could make a difference by sharing advice on previous experiences."

Whether we decide to voice our angle during dull moments or package our ideals away from publicity, our outlook is something we can never outrun. However, the freedom to express our views molds society, culture, and missions. This same freedom is woven through the framework of the Student Engineering Counsel. Cultivating engineering awareness and professional advancements propels engineering students at Texas A&M and provides them a platform to reveal their voices. With a representative voice, students are provided a secure environment to aid their success and an education they can critique, alter, and spur forward through personal experiences. Through the display of one\u2019s mind, the School of Engineering can continue to work alongside students to ensure an esteemed future for all Aggie Engineers.

            "Question 8": "Failure is an option. In some cases, it proves to be the best outcome. Through failure, we arise stronger, growing and learning each step along the way. By virtue of my freshman general engineering experience, I grew individually and learned how to depend on my fellow Aggies. Rewinding to my second semester at TAMU, you would see a timid student unwilling to request educational aid in physics. It was not until the final exam I decided to drop the course. After calling countless upper-level students trying to decipher what this would mean for my future ETAM experience. Little did I know that dropping the course was the best educational and social gain I could have made. Due to such a decision, I had an extra semester to decipher which engineering disciple to undertake with hopes of a future career. Through academic failure, today, you can examine an outgoing Industrial and Systems Engineering student who is always willing to request aid or assist those in solace. We all have stories of failure, but the story about how we rise is a narrative worth distinction.",

As an engineer my goal is not just to graduate, but to graduate with a job that I will love in my field. Professional advancement is a tool that could help me turn my academic career into an engineering career. It is also important that the SEC stands by professional advancement as one of its pillars because professional advancement isn\u2019t necessarily taught in the classroom. In fact, the best forms of professional advancement can be found at the SEC career fairs.

            "Question 8": "Last semester I bombed my first organic chemistry test. The night before the test, I glanced over the material and told myself that I knew everything that I needed to know. However, I was in for a rude awakening. During the test I was caught off guard because I lacked the depth of knowledge necessary to succeed in that class. Upon getting our test results back I knew something needed to change. I had to take a different approach to my study method so I could fully grasp the material. I did this by sacrificing time with my friends in order to go to SI sessions. I also made sure I understood the material soon after we learned it in class. This allowed me to continue to build on a strong foundation as we got new material. Throughout this experience I learned that difficult classes require thoughtful time and effort in order to understand the material.

I really liked working on these problems because they allowed me to use the full extent of the chemical engineering knowledge throughout the semester. Moreover, I enjoyed working on these problems because it gave me a taste of what a day in the life might be for a chemical engineer who is trying to solve problems for an elaborate chemical process. Being able to bounce ideas off of like-minded engineers to solve a problem reminded me why I chose to be a chemical engineer. This work motivated me to work hard and succeed in my schoolwork so I can one day work on optimizing complicated chemical processes for a company."

For instance, even when we take high-level classes at this university, we look towards online resources like YouTube videos or Chegg to solve our problems and learn the material. What difference does getting a degree at an engineering college make when compared to learning the same information online? The access to resources such as career fairs, recruiters, and connections to major corporations is what sets Texas A&M apart from raw knowledge institutions like online courses. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop the professional advancement pillar of the mission statement by improving career opportunities for engineering majors, whether that be strengthening corporate relations or enhancing the engineering entrepreneurship department. Doing so will help create leaders who can make advancements in the world of innovation and spread the values of Texas A&M engineering around the world, rather than just giving people a paper certificate to work 9-5 jobs. Professional advancement is the essence of engineering; it is what gives value to engineering at TAMU, which is why it means the most to me out of the three pillars.",
            "Question 8": "It was the fall semester of 2022. After getting accepted into my major of choice and entering my sophomore year, I felt ready to tackle the world. I searched for every organization or club at TAMU that perfectly matched my interests and could further my development as an engineer. I applied to a total of fifteen organizations, out of which I got seven interviews for leadership positions. I prepared and studied strenuously for all of the interviews for over three weeks. A few minutes before my first interview, I get ready, skim through my notes, feel well-prepared, and enter the room. However, as soon as I entered the room, my mind went blank. The feeling of preparedness I felt was no longer present; I did not know what to say or how to respond, and my inferiority complex persisted throughout the interview. The next five interviews felt similar, and although there was a slight improvement for each consecutive interview, I always left the room with a feeling of emptiness. Failure after failure, I was at an all-time low.\nI spent the next few months trying to ensure that I do not repeat this mistake of interview anxiety and that I can speak my mind confidently. I reviewed many interviewing techniques, such as the STAR method and \"the 3 C's.\" Then, at the beginning of this semester, I got an opportunity to interview for the aeroshell lead position at the TAMU Solar Car Racing Team. During the interview, I walked in confidently, implemented every method I had studied over the last few months, and got the position. I then realized that if I let my failures sink into my head and ensure that I never repeat my mistakes, I can overcome my failures and any future obstacles. Since then, I have become more confident, stopped feeling inferior, and begun creating a calm and collected mindset before going to any interview.",
            "Question 9": "I have always enjoyed working for what I love, but the one time that I started to get mind-blown was around two months ago when I made a 3D airfoil using SolidWorks CAD and ran a flow simulation using STAR CCM+ CFD. This was a project I worked on for the TAMU Solar Car Racing Team. The goal was to design an aeroshell that would direct the flow of the car in such a way that when the car was going on the interstate, it would experience nearly zero drag, zero lift, and fully laminar flow.\nWhat blew my mind about this project was that, unlike the projects I have been doing for my entire life for school or my classes, this project had immense value in the real world. The skills I used to develop and test the airfoil are in extremely high demand by major corporate companies such as Boeing or SpaceX that focus heavily on aerodynamics-related skill sets. The idea that my work would make hefty sums of money someday gave me a feeling of value and importance, making me feel motivated enough to push through two sleepless nights of constant designing and trial-and-error to develop the ideal aeroshell with almost negligible lift and drag."

            "Question 7": "I think the second pillar mentioned (increasing engineering awareness) resonates the most with me, because I think that engineering is a truly marvelous thing, and without it we would still be stuck banging sticks together. I feel like when people choose a major, they may stay away from anything engineering related because they think it's a ton of math stuff, and they don't realize that there are TONS of specializations that could probably fit their niche better. Spreading the word about engineering would probably result in a huge turnout of new students in these programs.",
            "Question 8": "One time that I failed at something was when I had failed to be the valedictorian of my high school's graduating class. I only consider this a failure because it was a personal goal of mine, and I had wanted to be valedictorian so my parents wouldn't have to spend a whole lot of money sending me to college. Things did not work out, though. I didn't get valedictorian and I felt like I had let myself and my parents down, and even though they assured me I did not, I still felt a little guilty. What I learned from this is that I needed to stay diligent in completing goals I had set for myself, even if they didn't have a ton of impact outside of my own personal interests. It's extremely important to stay on top of it even if the going seemed easy at the time. Another way I grew from that experience is for me to try to see the good in every situation. Even though I wasn't able to get the tuition free by being valedictorian, I was still able to go to my 1st choice university, A&M.",
            "Question 9": "A time that I enjoyed doing work would be working on my senior project for my high school engineering class. I had this idea that resonated with me and it was something I thought could be useful. Our class spent an entire semester working on it, and even though I ran into problems with it at almost every step of the way, I sort of enjoyed having to constantly problem solve, prototype and test, make changes, etc. in order to try to make it the best version of itself. Doing something like this for my project really clued me in on the engineering experience. There are so many factors to consider when building something like this, and it proved to be a good challenge for me. I hope to maybe have similar experiences like this with SEC."

Engineering students come to Texas A&M to make something of their talents. The courses give students a competitive toolbelt of intangible and tangible skills necessary to being world-class engineers. The SEC vouches for the College of Engineering in the professional world, setting up career fairs and talking to companies so that the students get the necessary exposure to competitive employers to get the internships, co-ops, and jobs fit for their level of competence. This past semester I have had great success in my search for internships, due in no small part to the work of the SEC. It would be an honor and a joy to follow in the footsteps of those who made my early professional success a possibility and to give others the same opportunities that I had.",
            "Question 8": "Freshman year, I went out for FREE and I got rejected. I knew a counselor in FREE and many of my friends were going out for FREE. It was very disappointing to be on the outside of an exclusive group that I liked, especially when it would have afforded me a cohesive friend group. I have kept small circles of close friends my entire life. This changed when I came to Texas A&M. I did not struggle making friends, but I struggled finding a cohesive group in which I felt I was thriving. I tried orgs, and made friends in various places, but I did not belong anywhere. I had grown accustomed to relying on the security of the circle of people around me. Last year I was forced to spend time with myself in a way that I have never had to in my life. It was uncomfortable at times, but it was a necessary torture. Outside the security of a group of friends, I was able to start my quest for belonging from scratch. I began to discover what I truly value and that where I belong is not in safety but in service to others.",
            "Question 9": "I am the service chair of my fraternity, SigEp. I joined because I was recruited by an active member with infectious excitement who insisted that this fraternity would be different. The fraternity was newly refounded with the mission to change what the word fraternity means. I have always wanted to play a leading role in community service and I envisioned that I could take advantage of the virtuous disposition of the fraternity and organize them to really make a difference in the community. There are a few different SigEp service projects in progress all of which I have played a key role in bringing to fruition. Right now I am working with one of the biggest non-profits in the Bryan College Station area to create a big service event for this semester as well as a philanthropy event that will be unique to SigEp for the fall. I am also working with a mentorship organization to help at-risk kids recognize their potential, and have older people to look up to. The work never bores me because I have a clear vision of the positive impact I will have on the lives of strangers in need."

It is vital that engineers here at Texas A&M receive support to ensure successful professional advancement both while in school and once they graduate so they can use the revolutionary skills and innovative ideas they developed here to make the world a better place.",
            "Question 8": "A time I failed at something was freshman year of high school when I came up short during tryouts and didn't make it onto my school's varsity marching band. Seeing a lot of my friends successfully make it made me feel bad and motivated me to work harder. After marching season ended, I got together with the directors and older band members to hone my music-playing and marching skills. The next summer, when tryouts came around again, the work paid off and I was able to make it onto varsity. This experience showed me that failure is a learning opportunity and rather than losing ambition from it, one should instead use it to work harder going forward.",
            "Question 9": "It's a unique feeling when you enjoy doing work. A personal example of this is when I was I would prepare to compete in summer USTA tennis tournaments. When I enjoy working, I feel like I go into autopilot and get completely focused on one goal. In this state, I felt like nothing could distract me, including the heat, mosquitoes, injuries, etc. I enjoyed doing this because I get a sense of satisfaction playing tennis, pushing my body, and challenging myself."

            "Question 8": "To explain briefly, I am an international student from South Korea, and last semester was my first time in the United States. Everything was new, unfamiliar, and hard to be adapted to the new environment. I was scared of everything, especially about not getting good grades, and it happened. I have a high standard for myself. Before I came here, I believe I can do perfectly in my first semester, and my GPA goal was 4.0 because I plan to get into a computer science major. After I came here and school started, everything passed with unbelievable speed, and I couldn't control anything even myself. Everything was unexpected, and I felt that I was chased by something every single moment. I just studied in my dorm and never hung out with my friends even if they wanted to hang out with me. Later, they asked me, \"Do you hate us?\" I finally ended up my first semester with my broken mind.\nDuring the winter break, I realized that I did not enjoy every single moment that I was involved in. I only focused on good grades, good results, and a good resume for my future, but now I know that focusing that way will not make a good experience. And I decide to enjoy and be thankful for this semester. Studying hard is important. But it's not at all. I got how to control myself from unexpected situations.",
            "Question 9": "Last semester, as a freshman engineering major, I really enjoyed ENGR 102. I like coding and I have coding experience, so I had never struggled with that course. As I mentioned above, surviving a new environment was hard for me, but ENGR 102 was only healing time for me. Especially, I was so glad to help other students who struggled with coding and assignments. I'm going to apply for a teaching assistant for next semester."

The interactions we make here will most likely dictate our pathways later on in life, especially if you are planning to stay in Texas for your professional career. However, even if you are not, the network of Aggies is so vast that you could meet one anywhere in the nation, even the world.

            "Question 8": "I played baseball for over 10 years and received offers from various D2 and low level D1 schools but decided to come to A&M to pursue my engineering career. I was a catcher and had a struggle with a certain phenomenon called, \"The Yips.\" Funny as it may sound, it is basically a mental block that appears out of thin air where you can't do something you have done for years, and it occurs frequently in overthinkers/perfectionists. Personally, I couldn't throw the ball back to the pitcher, and it really made me question my validity as a human if I am being honest. Not being able to do something I had been able to do completely fine for years ate away at me. However, I persevered through this, throwing every day and went through heavy mental conditioning to overcome this barrier. I ended up moving to left field for a time, and when I returned to the catching position, I had overcome it. I learned that anything can be achieved through complete dedication and perseverance. This lesson has stayed with me since then, and I apply it to everything I do in my life. You really can do anything you want if you want it enough.",
            "Question 9": "I went on a camping trip last summer to Enchanted Rock, and I was completely unprepared if I am being honest. I was with two of my friends and when we got halfway to our camping spot, the wheels on our wagon literally snapped off, and all of our things that we brought just scattered around. Keep in mind we were about 3 miles still from our camping location on extremely uneven terrain, lugging around about 200 pounds of stuff that was difficult to conveniently carry. However, through teamwork, we made it to our camping spot in around 3 and a half hours with not a lot of water and just before dark. It was one of the most fun experiences of my life, and also one of the physically toughest ones. Although it was grueling and I got completely sore from it, I really just enjoyed being alive and being with my friends more than the actual work. The work is short term and you have to get through it to the other side, sort of like delayed gratification. Life is a beautiful thing and shouldn't be taken for granted, even if you feel some pain about it once in a while."

I was the primary soloist for three of the four songs and thus it was my responsibility to have my part memorized and practiced to the point that I could play it flawlessly. Our final performance was in San Antonio at AT&T Stadium. We spent the day prior enjoying the city and having fun but the day of it was all practice and nerves. We spent a few hours preparing and when our time slot was called we marched out onto the field and performed our final performance of the year. That performance in the huge stadium under the lights was the most nerve-racking but also enjoyable performance of my life.

I was also able to write about what I discovered and put it online, to moderate success (https://github.com/harrisonheld/AstrologyECS). If I had not failed in that initial approach, I do not think I would have been able to do it. I needed the knowledge of all the problems that the approach had in order to choose a different one.

I don't have to think about \"I am solving this problem because I want to get paid\", because I forget about everything outside of the problem itself.\nI have found the flow-state to be a very good thing for mental health. If you are able to get into it regularly, you will be a very effective worker. I try to use it whenever I can, like when doing homework. If I do it all at once without taking any breaks, I find the total time taken is less than if I took breaks, because it makes me lose my train of thought."

Since I was in middle school at that time, so I was at that vulnerable age, this accomplishment really helped me feel better about the other things I had been struggling with at the moment.",

Though there were many reasons as to why I enjoyed this job, there was one that mainly stuck out, and that was tutoring and helping these kids with their school work. I loved knowing that if the kids were ever unsure of how to do something that they felt comfortable enough with me to ask me for help, the fact that they trusted me so much. This was a time I truly felt so helpful, I loved helping these kids. I enjoyed being someone that others could trust."

This was a huge blow to my confidence, especially since I had been working so hard leading up to the season. Despite the immediate bitterness I faced, I realized I had to set aside my pride and be a leader to my present team. In addition, this experience helped me to push myself even harder so I could attain my starting position the following season. Throughout my many years of playing volleyball, that season definitely taught me the most in regard to leadership. I realized that no matter where I'm placed, I have a responsibility to do my best - continuing to push myself while also helping, encouraging, and prioritizing my team.",
            "Question 9": "Throughout my high school career, I was involved in an organization called National Charity League. Through such, I had many opportunities to volunteer and give back to my community. One of my favorite places to volunteer was at a childrens summer camp called Friends of Texas Wildlife. While not exactly an expert on wildlife, after being given a quick debrief over the showcased animals, I had the opportunity to help the kids with their activities and tell them a little bit about the animals that had been brought in. I loved seeing how excited they got as well as how well informed and passionate some of them were about learning about the wildlife. It honestly inspired and reminded myself of the excitement over learning something new."

There are many people out there who have the potential to be great engineers and do great things in the world, but they won't know because, for some reason, people don't know what engineers do for a living.

All the pillars aim to develop better Engineers that have experience in their respective fields of interest which is a big reason why I feel like I would be able to learn and grow under SEC, but if I had to choose one out of the 3 it would be internal. The College of Engineering is huge, to say the least, there are so many students that it would be almost impossible for the deans of the college to even hear the thoughts of a handful of those students. Internal committees of the SEC act as the \u201crepresentative voice\u201d for Engineering students which is incredibly important in order to share the student\u2019s perspective with the Engineering deans.

            "Question 8": "The Junior years of high school and university are often infamously cited as the toughest and most rigorous years of school for good reason. In my junior year of high school, I took AP Physics 1 and to cut my suffering short I did not do great. I did horrible, I failed most of the tests, and if not for homework/quiz grades I could\u2019ve easily failed the course. It sometimes felt like all the hours of studying I put into the course were ultimately fruitless, after all, I had little to no success as a product of my effort. Luckily, I did not let my personal failure cloud my judgment. I had a very clear understanding that quitting and complaining would get me absolutely nowhere, I would have to try again and again. Though my effort didn\u2019t manage to salvage my grade in the course, I would learn a lot about overcoming difficult obstacles. For my senior year, I took AP Physics 2, and despite my previous failures in Physics 1, it seemed like I had obtained a load of valuable knowledge about the course material, which would help me a lot in Physics 2.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer I got to work as a lifeguard, for Swim Houston. I would say I rather enjoyed it a lot. I would go in early in the morning probably 30 minutes before opening to clean out the drains and test the pool chemicals along with more procedural tasks. I would then open along with my co-workers, and we would be shifted to a stand to watch over a pool for about 15 minutes then change to our next station rotating through 8 before reaching break. At first, I didn\u2019t like my job, sitting under the burning Texas sun is almost unbearable, I came home with sunburns more times than I could count, and on top of that, there were multiple individuals that had no respect for the lifeguards. I began to like the job after talking to this one patron in the pool that had a son graduate from A&M\u2019s College of Engineering. I have no particular reason to value this moment out of all of my lifeguarding experience, but I began to see the patrons and my co-workers differently, I would start to converse with them more learning and sharing particular interests growing out of my shell."

One day I was doing tests on concrete that are being used to pour pillars and walls. The general contractor saw me testing and was furious over simple mistakes I made. He would grab my tools and do the test himself and say mean things to me. In this case, I failed both at doing a good job for my company, and the company who hired my company. However, it wasn't intentional that I was doing a bad job, on the contrary, I am very interested and eager to to be performing the tests. I sucked up all the remarks and confronted him, saying: \"I am new to this job and I am only nineteen and in college. I want to do my job well, can you teach me?\" Then we all moved forward with more contempt for each other. I grew from this experience by a willingness to confront and ask questions.

I was working its renovation project with my supervisor. My job is to make sure every quantity needed for this project are correct.

All these data are collected and tabulated in one of the first ten pages of the project. This is done through MicroStation. Bonnie View Road was three minutes away from my home in Dallas. I take this road to get gas and shop groceries. It\u2019s still shocking to believe that I will be one of the people deciding and designing how the road will be mended and renovated; I was part of this road\u2019s fate as an eighteen year-old.

As the year progressed, I kept studying circuits because I knew they would be on the AP test, and I needed to improve on them. In the weeks leading up to the AP test, I spent the most time studying them, and it became a real strength of mine. On the day of the AP test I was extremely confident in my ability to answer circuit questions. Whenever I got to a circuit question, I was always able to get an answer I was confident in, and when a harder question came up in the free response section, I was able to get a good answer.

I felt as though my window to study abroad had closed because I was rejected from my dream program, and I wasn't sure when I would have the opportunity to travel again because of the global lockdown. Two years later, I was not enthusiastic to reapply, fearing that I would face rejection and discouragement again.

            "Question 8": "The time when my team did not win the digital video production competition. It was our first competition, and it was something we had never really done before. So much work went into the production, like script writing, props, and editing. We knew it wasn't the best, but we still wanted to try. We didn't qualify for the next round, but I learned much from the experience. I learned that video production takes time and effort, so my respect for people in those fields grew immensely.",
            "Question 9": "Engineering projects I had done when I was in high school. For instance, one of the project themes was to create a design and prototype which incorporated a hydrogen-fuel tank and why we chose that design. I came up with an airplane design as aircraft are one of the causes of carbon emissions. It was fun designing and creating the prototype, which made it more sure that engineering is the path I want to follow in the future."

            "Question 9": "I worked at Quiktrip for two year during high school and I loved it. I was always talking to customers or helping make food in the kitchen. The experiences I had at the job and the people around me is what made it truly fun."

            "Question 8": "After I completed my eagle project, I got complacent. I figured that, since it was already done, filling out the paperwork, and making sure to submit it to the proper authorities, and setting up meetings with my scoutmaster would be simple and quick. However, a couple days stretched into nearly half a year and I almost didn\u2019t get everything done on time. That was probably the highest impact mistake I have made so far.",
            "Question 9": "My interview project in my sophomore year of high school, I made an animation in the Blender CAD software that basically was a a model and rendering of my grandparents old house. It was my first and only attempt at architectural visualization, and I think it turned out pretty well."
