            "Question 8": "At a school as big as A&M, in a college as big as the College of Engineering, it is hard to imagine that students would have a significant voice. After attending the SEC informational, I was amazed to see all the ways that students can improve and lead important events like Career Fair. I believe that the best way to inspire growth is through constructive feedback and diverse input, so SEC\u2019s pillar of being the representative voice of all engineering students means the most to me.\nAs a student, it is important to know that my feedback is heard and that my education is being tailored to my needs. When my high school was selecting a new counselor, I was selected to give the final candidates an interview. Seeing how my feedback was taken into consideration meant a lot to me, and I saw firsthand how much my school cared about its students. I felt the same way when I learned about the SEC's Legislation committee and how they communicate students\u2019 concerns with College administration. I am passionate about contributing to a better environment for my peers, and I believe that SEC is the perfect avenue to do so.",
            "Question 9": "In my junior year of high school, I was nominated to lead a team of 15 classmates in a fundraising campaign for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS), aiming to raise $40,000 in just seven weeks.\nAs someone who wants to be an oncologist, I am very passionate about LLS\u2019s mission: curing blood cancers and improving the lives of patients and their families. Initially, success meant meeting our fundraising goal, but as the campaign progressed, I began defining the success of our campaign in different ways. I found success when I completed a successful sponsorship meeting with the Corporate Social Responsibility representative of a company, a meeting I was initially extremely nervous for. I found success when I learned that passion can overcome inexperience, and that genuine belief in a cause can inspire others. I found success when over the course of the seven week campaign, I watched as a group of 15 people who barely knew each other grew closer, united by a common goal. The community and confidence I gained from this experience made our more tangible success, raising over $117,000 for LLS, all the more meaningful.",
            "Question 10": "One of the most valuable lessons I learned about working with others came from my first job. As a chiropractic assistant, I provided therapies like cold laser and e-stim to patients after their adjustments. Early on, I followed the \u201cscript\u201d I was trained to use. However, I added a simple, genuine question to my routine\u2014\u201cHow\u2019s your day been?\u201d\nI found that this question, one we typically don\u2019t give much thought to, changed the patients\u2019 experience altogether. People began opening up to me, and I was told stories about grandkids and terrible workdays, and I even got some great life advice. Years of conversing with patients taught me that we all have unique experiences that shape the way we think.\nThis knowledge has greatly influenced the way I work in a group. I realized that when we take the time to listen to the ideas of others, we are exposed to a variety of perspectives, which make us more well-rounded. When I work with others, I prioritize promoting an environment where everyone\u2019s input is valued, even those who may not initially speak up, whether it be encouraging feedback or checking in with people individually outside of the group environment.",
            "Question 11": "When I was young, my parents and I moved from India to the United States. Because I did not know much English, I struggled to communicate with other kids. My teacher, Mrs. Parks, noticed this and went out of her way to make sure I understood her lessons. She always showed interest in the traditional foods in my lunch, helping me view my culture as something special. She encouraged me to participate, and in this formative year I found my voice.\nThis experience influenced me to become someone who celebrates the ideas and backgrounds of others. Years later, I discovered the Vickery Meadow Summer Reading Academy, which provides English tutoring to children living in a predominantly immigrant community. Reminded of my own experiences, it was extremely rewarding to tutor other children whose second language is English. Because most of these children have significant responsibilities at home, I was happy to provide an environment for them to just be kids. I always made sure to remind the kids I tutored that they are more than capable of achieving anything, and it meant a lot to me that I was able to pay forward the encouragement Mrs. Parks showed me."

            "Question 8": "Engineering Awareness stands out as the most important pillar of the SEC Mission Statement to me because I believe it serves as the foundation for both professional advancement and the development of a representative voice. My experience as an Outreach Lead for my town\u2019s robotics team highlighted how crucial it is to promote engineering to spark interest in STEM among students. I led robotics workshops for students of all ages, many of whom went on to excel in STEM competitions such as Destination Imagination (My team placed 3rd in the Global Finals!). By engaging with students of all ages, we can raise awareness about the field and instill a passion for engineering within them. This is why I appreciate the SEC\u2019s efforts with the Envision Conference, which provides a platform for members to inspire a love for learning in students in a hands-on environment. Additionally, the SEC\u2019s involvement in Engineers\u2019 Week perfectly represents how awareness should be organized, creating an open atmosphere for prospective and current students to explore STEM while building meaningful connections. As an SEC member, I would love to contribute to events like the Envision Conference and Engineers\u2019 Week and build upon them.",
            "Question 9": "I've been passionate about computers and building things for as long as I can remember. Recently, I set a goal to build a watch using Nixie tubes, which required designing my own PCBs, selecting compatible components, using CNC machines to craft the watch case, coding the time functions, and then some. Success, for me, was defined by bringing this complex project to life\u2014turning a concept into a functional, tangible product.\nThroughout the process, I faced numerous challenges and made several mistakes, from circuit design errors to issues with machining the case. However, I viewed these setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures. My goal was not just to build a working watch but to grow through the process and hone my skills in design, coding, and problem-solving.\nFinally seeing the watch turn on was one of the most euphoric moments I've ever had. It wasn\u2019t just about completing the project; it was about realizing that with enough time and dedication, I could accomplish anything I once thought was out of reach. Building this watch reaffirmed my belief that success is achieved through perseverance and a willingness to learn from mistakes. You can check out my project page for the watch on my website: https://yusiali.com/projects/nixieWatch/.",
            "Question 10": "Launching a startup is not easy, and as with any new business, it requires a significant amount of human resources. LearnToBot, a company founded by my dad\u2019s friend to foster a passion for STEM in children, was no exception. When I first learned about it, I was immediately drawn to the idea of combining hardware and software to teach kids how to code through robotics. However, the founder faced significant challenges, including limited funding and a lack of staff. His initial plan was to hold a free pilot camp to introduce his mission to the community, but he needed help to make it happen.\nGiven my passion for coding and robotics, I volunteered to assist. I gathered a group of volunteer instructors from my local robotics team, and together, we made the pilot camp a success, with over forty children enrolled. Working together as a team, we provided 1-on-1 guidance to each student, helping them build and code their first robot. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration and how collective efforts can turn challenges into opportunities.\nToday, I curate the LearnToBot curriculum and teach over 100 students as a lead instructor during seasonal camps. My time at LearnToBot has shown me the power of working with others to achieve a common goal, and I\u2019m excited to bring this experience to Texas A&M to help build the next generation of engineers.",
            "Question 11": "While living in Saudi Arabia, I met many local workers who had left their home countries in search of better opportunities for their families. Unfortunately, many of them lived far from grocery and appliance stores, leaving them to rely heavily on company-provided amenities. I wanted to help change that, so I got involved with my school\u2019s student council to create the Saudi Shuf Shop, a store that redistributed donated goods to those in need.\nAs part of my role, I was responsible for finding contributors, assisting customers, and sorting donations around the store. It was a rewarding yet challenging experience, as the demand for essential items was high. However, through our collective efforts, we managed to distribute a year's worth of foodstuffs and kitchenware to over 100 local workers.\nThis experience taught me the importance of community service and how small acts of kindness can make a significant difference in the lives of others. Serving these workers not only allowed me to give back to the community but also deepened my understanding of the challenges they faced daily. It reinforced my belief in the power of service and the impact it can have on people's lives."

        "Questions": {
            "Question 8": "Increasing engineering awareness throughout programs and events means the most to me. During the SEC informational on Tuesday, September 10th, I was drawn to the outreach events focused on children, such as the Envision Conference and the philanthropy REACH events. I have been a nanny for years, and have gained skills to teach and inspire children. I find joy in educating them about things I am passionate about, in both engineering and academics. Through nannying, I have gotten to experience how early exposure can build a child\u2019s confidence and spark an interest in learning. These outreach events provide young minds the opportunity to understand concepts of engineering at their comprehension level.\nAs a first-generation student who once lacked the confidence to pursue a higher education, I understand the importance of having someone encourage your dreams. It\u2019s not just about promoting engineering but empowering young generations to believe in their potential, just as I needed someone to do for me. As an SEC member, I am committed to being an encouraging voice for younger generations. In SEC I plan to create a more inspiring environment for future engineers, ensuring they have the confidence and support they need to pursue their dreams.",
            "Question 9": "At the beginning of my college journey, I struggled with defining a direction for my future career. Initially, I was a student at Texas State University and lacked a vision for my long-term goals. A few months into my college experience, I gained confidence in my abilities and decided to pursue mechanical engineering. Recognizing Texas A&M as one of the best schools for this, I set a new goal: to transfer to Texas A&M. It wasn\u2019t easy, but a year and a half later, I accomplished this goal.\nThis experience taught me the importance of perseverance, and setting goals to achieve success. When I look back at the challenges I have faced that ended in success, I realize it was passion and commitment that got me there. As an SEC member, I can apply this mindset by encouraging my peers and younger generations to set ambitious goals and work towards them without worry of failure. Put your best foot forward, and you will succeed. Currently, even when I am overwhelmed by coursework, I am able to see the bigger picture. I have been given a wonderful opportunity to attend this school, which pushes me to be the best version of myself. I know that I am being given all of the tools to succeed but it is me who puts in the work to carry them out. Bringing this perspective to SEC, I will help and encourage others to achieve their academic goals with appreciation and dedication to carry through.",
            "Question 10": "I currently work for a nannying agency, where I come into contact with new people almost every day. About a month ago, I babysat for a bilingual family a few times. The children\u2019s parents mostly spoke Spanish to them, so the children did not know any English.\nTo overcome this challenge, I learned a few basic Spanish cues and phrases that were necessary to communicate with them. I used translation apps, some of my prior knowledge, and gestures to communicate. Over a few visits, I became more comfortable using this way of communication which made my interactions smoother and helped me to bond with them. By showing effort to communicate in their native language I gained trust and appreciation with the family.\nThis experience taught me that working with others, especially those from different cultures or linguistic backgrounds, requires adaptability, patience and willingness to learn. By stepping out of my comfort zone and making an effort to communicate in their language I realized that it is important to embrace diversity and people of all backgrounds. As an SEC member, I can apply these lessons by fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels heard and respected. Just as I adjusted my way of communication in this experience, I can work to make sure the engineering students at Texas A&M feel welcome and supported. We can work to bridge the gaps between all types of people and further work towards creating a thriving community within SEC.",
            "Question 11": "For many years I have volunteered for VBS camps and nursery work for bible studies/church service. Through this, I have been given the experience to teach children about Jesus. While parents get time to focus on their own spiritual journeys, I get to engage children in the same, at their comprehension level.\nThrough these experiences, I have learned the value of service, both in the church and in the community. Volunteering in the church has shown me that it is important to create an environment that can place seeds in their heart to grow a relationship with God. By teaching children about Jesus, I have found that I also get to take away something from this, by building a stronger relationship with God.\nAs an SEC member, I can apply these experiences by fostering an accepting and supportive atmosphere within the organization. Just as I help children learn about God, I can work to ensure that members of SEC and our community feel heard and supported. I will bring the same care to my SEC responsibilities by helping others grow academically and personally, just as I have done in the church community."

            "Question 8": "\"But, what does an engineer even do?\" This was always the question that followed after I told my friends that my dad was an engineer, and for a long time, I didn't know the answer to it. Engineering is a mystery to many children because it is such a broad field, ranging from software development to building bridges. This is why SEC's mission statement of increasing engineering awareness resonates deeply with me. The world is never going to stop needing engineers, and it is our duty to educate future generations about the field so that the human race can keep advancing.\nI would love to be a part of the EnVision conference, which would allow me to share my passion for engineering with younger kids and ignite an interest in them that propels them into a life in STEM. Growing the event to new heights, reaching larger audiences, and increasing the overall success is a challenge I want to meet head-on. However, the event\u2019s success is only as good as the impact it has on every individual, so I would make sure to scale the program without losing the essence of what makes it special for each individual kid.",
            "Question 9": "Moving to Houston from Costa Rica was like grabbing a fish that\u2019s lived in a tank his whole life and dropping it in the Pacific Ocean. I was exposed to people from cultures and backgrounds from all over the world, which comes with different societal standards. I decided I\u2019d measure my success during my first year in America based on whether I was able to fit in with the crowd. I assimilated, I adapted my accent, learned how to play (American) football, and even picked up new values. When I found my first friend group, I felt proud of all the effort I put in to fit in. However, it wasn\u2019t long before I realized that I was selling myself short.\nLearning about and appreciating other cultures is important, but never drown out who you are and where you came from. I was successful in my original goal, I was able to fit in. I now know that the real success of this story was redefining my idea of success. Rather than changing myself to fit in, I now take pride in sharing my culture. Meeting people from different backgrounds should be a two-way street, with both parties learning as much as they\u2019re sharing. By redefining what it meant to be successful, I was able to connect with the people around me on a much deeper level. I now apply these lessons to every relationship I build, hoping to connect as close as possible to the people around me.",
            "Question 10": "This summer, I worked for my dad\u2019s construction company. As a 19-year-old, I expected to be the youngest person on the job site by far. I was wrong. I worked with guys my age who found themselves at radically different points in their lives, most of whom were working to provide for their families or themselves.\nStudying engineering can be very overwhelming at times, often pushing the limits of how much stress I believe I can withstand. However, the pressure these guys were under gave me a whole new perspective. When you are the difference between putting food on the table for your family or not, failure is not an option.\nI tried to be the best coworker possible, often offering to help on the job they were doing or getting lunch for them if I was picking up food. I attempted to make them feel like we were in this together, hoping to shoulder some of the load they were under.\nIf these guys were going through such extreme amounts of pressure in their personal lives, what makes the older workers different? Or for that matter, what makes my 217 lab partner different? Chances are they don\u2019t have kids back home relying on them, but they have other stressful situations that are taking a toll on them. Sometimes all we need is to feel like we are not in it alone, that someone else wants us to succeed. That is the sentiment I try to ignite in others.",
            "Question 11": "The non-profit organization HUSL has allowed me to combine my love for sports with my desire to help others. Here, I served as a soccer and basketball coach for kids ages 3-15. We created a safe space where our players can enjoy themselves through sports and open up about their problems.\nThe program is hosted in a low-income area, and many of the kids grow up in troubled homes and have a rough upbringing. We teach them sports, but our real mission is keeping them on the right track. We made it possible for everyone to join our league regardless of their socioeconomic barriers by giving them cleats, basketball shoes, and practice shirts. Teaching them how to work as a team, respect others, and have a strong work ethic are all crucial goals of our program. During every practice, I took 10 minutes to talk with my players about the challenges they're facing. I offered advice to the best of my abilities, knowing it could impact them for years to come. I saw firsthand how guidance can completely change the trajectory of someone\u2019s life. This concept is deeply rooted in SEC\u2019s mission, which I would love to carry out."

            "Question 8": "Of the three areas in the SEC mission, the one that resonates most with me is fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students. I\u2019ve always believed that professional growth is key to success, and I\u2019ve actively sought opportunities to help both myself and others develop the skills needed for future careers.\nDuring my time at Texas A&M, I\u2019ve helped many students in Data Science Club with projects, where I got to share my knowledge of data analysis and AI with fellow students. I\u2019ve also co-founded a business, SwimMatch, which gave me invaluable hands-on experience managing a team and developing solutions that directly impacted clients. These experiences taught me the importance of not only learning but applying that knowledge in real-world settings.\nI'm passionate about creating opportunities for both myself and other students to gain experience and prepare for success in our future careers. Whether it\u2019s through mentorship, collaboration, or problem-solving, I know there\u2019s so much I can learn from working with others. I see professional growth as a shared journey, where we can help each other improve our skills and reach our goals together.",
            "Question 9": "Last year, I attended the SEC career fair with high hopes of securing an internship. I had prepared extensively, believing that success would be defined by walking away with an offer in hand. I was excited and confident that this would be my big opportunity to break into the professional world. However, things didn\u2019t go as planned, and I left the fair feeling that I didn't put the greatest impression on the recruiters. At first, it felt like I had failed and missed my chance to succeed and achieve my goal.\nThat experience motivated me to reflect on what I could improve. I worked hard to refine my resume, took on new projects, and joined clubs and organizations that allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. I started to define success not just by the outcomes but by how much I was learning and evolving. This shift in mindset pushed me to seek out new opportunities and develop my skills, which, in the long run, has been even more valuable than that internship I initially sought.",
            "Question 10": "One experience that significantly shaped my perspective on working with others was co-founding SwimMatch, a business aimed at connecting swimming coaches with students. Initially, I thought that the key to success was simply having a great idea and executing it efficiently on my own. However, as the venture grew, I quickly realized that success depended on collaboration and teamwork.\nWorking alongside my co-founders and coaches, I learned that each person brought different strengths and ideas to the table. We had to align our vision, communicate clearly, and constantly adapt to the challenges we faced, whether it was improving the website, managing customer expectations, or finding ways to scale the business. It taught me that no matter how capable you are individually, the ability to collaborate effectively with others is crucial.\nThis experience helped me understand the importance of listening, being open to feedback, and valuing diverse perspectives. By working as a team, we were able to grow SwimMatch into a successful business. It reshaped how I approach teamwork, highlighting that success is often a collective effort, where the contributions of each member are vital to achieving the shared goal.",
            "Question 11": "One experience that stands out is my time serving as an Educational Program Facilitator at Tawasol in Egypt. Every summer, I taught English to underprivileged students, helping them improve their language skills and boosting their confidence. It wasn\u2019t just about teaching the curriculum; it was about connecting with the students and making sure they had the resources and support they needed to succeed.\nHowever, it was also a learning curve for me. I had to adapt my teaching style to meet the diverse needs of the students, many of whom faced challenges outside of the classroom that affected their learning. This experience taught me the importance of patience, empathy, and flexibility.\nServing at Tawasol wasn\u2019t just about giving back; it was a mutual exchange. While I helped the students improve their English, they helped me grow as a mentor and a leader, teaching me the value of service and the impact it can have on both the giver and the receiver."

            "Question 9": "For me, success is not necessarily the end product of what I started; rather, it is about how much I grow during the journey and how I overcome the challenges I face along the way. This past summer, I co-founded a business named Meals4U, which is an UberEats-inspired platform but with a healthy, home-style cooking twist. When I embarked on this venture, I initially believed success would be defined by achieving $1,500 in revenue by the end of the summer. However, as I began building the full-stack application, marketing the service, and networking with potential partners and customers, I often felt overwhelmed. The weight of potentially not reaching this financial goal clouded my mind.\nSoon, though, I had a revelation. I realized that every step forward\u2014whether it was debugging a piece of code, or having meaningful conversations about my business\u2014was a form of success. I began to see that the process itself was where the true value lay. Even when the progress seemed minor, I was learning something new every day, sharpening my skills, and gaining deeper insights into both entrepreneurship and myself.\nUltimately, the experience taught me that success isn't necessarily tied to an external metric like revenue. It\u2019s about staying committed to the process, embracing the small wins, and trusting that the cumulative effort will lead to something meaningful\u2014even if it\u2019s not exactly what I initially envisioned. My focus shifted from being solely outcome-driven to appreciating the journey, and that mindset change was a success in itself.",
            "Question 10": "During my freshman year at Texas A&M, I participated in Aggies Invent, a 48-hour competition in which my team of seven upperclassmen was tasked with designing a drone to disable unexploded ordnances. As the only freshman on the team, I was surprised to be elected team leader. However, I was immediately met with skepticism. One teammate, a junior aerospace engineer, even suggested that he should lead instead, doubting my ability to \u201chandle the pressure.\u201d\nAt first, it felt isolating to receive little attention or trust from my teammates, but I knew that to earn their respect, I had to prove my value. I spent the first night deeply researching the project, preparing to contribute both technically and strategically. Additionally, I implemented regular check-ins to ensure everyone\u2019s ideas were heard and that we remained aligned as a team. Slowly, these actions started to change the team\u2019s perception of me. As I facilitated smoother collaboration and guided us through technical roadblocks, my teammates began to trust my leadership.\nBy the end of the competition, the team\u2019s initial doubt had transformed into confidence. We placed third and earned $1,500 toward our education, but more importantly, we had grown together throughout the process. This experience taught me that leadership and teamwork are built on communication, persistence, and mutual respect\u2014qualities that can overcome any initial skepticism or doubts.",
            "Question 11": "This summer before entering university, my friends and I wanted to invest in the stock market and soon we realized we did not have any financial literacy. Later, when we tried learning we realized many reliable courses are quite expensive online. In fact, I also noticed how people from my own community were not able to afford such courses. This led me to create software that would spread financial literacy among school districts within the DFW metroplex for free. By first becoming financially literate, I decided to target high schoolers. Within 15 weeks I was able to deploy a fully functional website that consisted of interactive games, videos, and even personalized quizzes. Later, I distributed my software to 14 underfunded school districts, and in less than 3 weeks the software gained over 1000 student users. Additionally, I was able to partner up with people from these underserved communities and I built a network where students can ask questions and seek help from people with similar backgrounds to create comfort. Overall this experience of serving others with knowledge has been a beautiful experience and continues to motivate me."

            "Question 8": "Growing up, I was always encouraged to become an engineer as I come from a long line of engineers who saw engineering as a path to independence. While I\u2019ve always wanted to become an oncologist, choosing biomedical engineering as my undergraduate major as my future career has been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. Engineering has shown me that there are no limits to growth and innovation and will allow me to pursue the field of medicine in a unique and inspiring way, which has always been my dream. SEC\u2019s pillar of engineering awareness resonates with me because I want to help others discover the same freedom and opportunities in the field of engineering. Since 2020, I\u2019ve been tutoring elementary school children in math and science. My goal has been to inspire them to become the next generation of innovators\nby introducing and teaching these subjects in fun and unique ways. If given the opportunity, I would love to be part of the Envision Conference and continue working on sharing the possibilities engineering offers!",
            "Question 9": "In high school, I was ranked first in wrestling during my senior year. However, during the regional quarterfinals, I dislocated my arm. Despite this, I managed to finish the match, win the tournament, and advanced to state. Unfortunately, I re-dislocated my shoulder during the first match at state, which limited all my upper body movement. Even with this setback, I pushed through and still managed to place. This experience transformed my understanding of success. Initially, I saw success as a straight line, from the starting point to the goal (in this case, 1st). Now, I view success as something that is fluid. My injuries weren\u2019t roadblocks but hurdles to overcome, requiring me to redefine what success was with each match. Even though I didn\u2019t win state, I consider myself successful because I persevered, pushing both my physical and mental limits. I\u2019ve come to realize that success isn\u2019t just about achieving goals, it\u2019s about the effort I put in overcoming challenges, and most importantly, growing as a person. As team captain, I also understood that my success wasn\u2019t just personal, it meant leading and inspiring my teammates to push through their own challenges. By setting an example of perseverance, I was able to motivate my team to strive for their best, even in difficult times. Success became not only about my growth but also about helping others achieve their potential.",
            "Question 10": "This past summer, I worked as a medical assistant at a primary care physician\u2019s office. In addition to triaging patients, the MAs and I split all the tasks we had to complete throughout the day to balance the workload. The office was constantly busy, which meant we often had to stay late to finish our tasks. One of my coworkers, Carol, consistently went beyond her duties, staying to help others even after she had finished her work. Observing her, I realized how impactful it is to be proactive in supporting your team. Inspired by her example, I began to do the same. When my own tasks were complete, I would look for ways to help my coworkers. This not only made us more efficient but also created a stronger sense of camaraderie among us all. I also worked to create a collaborative atmosphere where everyone felt comfortable asking questions and sharing knowledge, just as Carol had done before. This experience taught me that leadership is about more than just achieving your own goals, it\u2019s about empowering those around you to succeed. If given the opportunity I want to bring these qualities into my participation with SEC. Helping others feel supported so that together we are able to hit our respective potential socially and academically.",
            "Question 11": "This past year, I volunteered with a hospice company as I was motivated to understand my cousin's experience in hospice. Through this, I learned that serving others is not just about giving, but also about the shared growth and connection that comes with it. Spending time with patients who had visitors, listening to their life stories, and engaging in their hobbies showed me the impact of simply being present. A memorable experience I had was with Rick, an 87-year-old with Parkinson\u2019s. Initially, I planned to visit him once a week, but after Rick had told me that he enjoyed our conversations, I began visiting him every day. A few days before he passed, Rick had thanked me for brightening his days, and I realized he had done the same for me. The time I spent with him didn\u2019t just bring him comfort, it enriched my life, teaching me patience, empathy, and the reward of forming meaningful connections. Through this experience, I came to understand that service is not a one-sided act of giving, but a shared experience that gives something to both parties. Serving others is just as much about learning and personal growth as it is about helping."

            "Question 8": "I am deeply passionate about increasing engineering awareness. I come from a smaller city out west where very few people even dream of leaving the area for college, much less going to a big university to study engineering with plans of building rockets that will fly to the moon. Programs to introduce K -12 students to engineering deeply impacted my choice to take the leap and come to Texas A&M to pursue my dreams. I am particularly interested in the EnVision conference, which would allow me to work with high schoolers and pursue this passion. As part of SEC, I plan to do what was done for me and expose K-12 students to the world of engineering. I want to give these students the knowledge and resources that were critical for me and \u201creturn the favor\u201d of helping young students pursue their dreams. I am also interested in the Student Relations committee. I want to follow through with the students who are passionate about engineering and help them continue to succeed through programs like Mental Health Week.",
            "Question 9": "I have always found that the successes I am most proud of cannot be quantified and have far more to do with the impact I can have on people. As a high school student, I was captain of a robotics team. Within robotics, there are a lot of quantifiable successes: awards, points gained, and matches won. Despite all these traditional metrics of success, I never made those my objectives as team captain.\nInstead, I made it my goal to help my team members improve and develop their skills. Many of my team members came into the program very shy and nervous about networking with others. I wanted to help those students come out of their shells and learn to showcase their knowledge to others.\nWithin this goal, I deemed myself successful if my teammate was comfortable going up and speaking to another team by the end of the year. My proudest moment as team captain was when one student went from being so shy that she would freeze if anyone approached her to that same teammate becoming the director of outreach for the entire robotics program. Knowing that I had been able to help her get to that point was a much bigger success than any award could have been.",
            "Question 10": "Last year, I had the opportunity to work on the GeoRGE rover project within AggieSat Laboratory. This project had over 40 members, and I felt very lost amongst my more experienced teammates. I wasn't sure what I could do to help or how I fit into the project's goals. At the beginning of my time on the project, I mostly sat back and watched everyone else, waiting for someone to tell me what to do.\nHowever, I quickly realized that staying passive would mean getting overlooked. I began to ask more questions and start doing the small tasks that I noticed were getting forgotten in the rush to get the project completed. By the end of the project, I was writing most of our documentation and actively constructing and testing the rover.\nThis experience shaped my perspective on teamwork, teaching me that initiative is one of the most valuable qualities in a teammate. I learned that collaboration requires more than good leaders; it requires each team member to seek out opportunities themselves. I now understand that a good teammate makes the leader's job easier by finding ways to help without being asked.",
            "Question 11": "I come from a tiny K-12 school with a close-knit community. In the 8th grade, my school was at risk of closure due to a lack of funding. This seemed like an insurmountable obstacle. What could I do to fight the all-powerful administrators? After reeling from the initial shock, I decided to write a petition. The chances of this succeeding were next-to-none, but I couldn\u2019t sit down and watch as the community I loved crumbled around me. I drafted the petition and shared it online. Everyone around me told me my little petition was useless, but I stood firm. Something had to be done. Soon enough, my petition circulated online and had over 2000 signatures. I planned to present this at the open forum after the meeting on the school closure, but much to my chagrin, there was no open forum. Instead of letting this be the end of my efforts, I walked straight up to the administrator and presented my petition during her meeting. My little petition managed to forestall the school closure and buy time to get more funding. I was able to serve my community by helping to preserve it."

            "Question 8": "I grew up in a family of engineers. From a young age, I was exposed to the endless possibilities of engineering. I\u2019d make cars from LEGO robotics kits. I\u2019d watch as my dad coded on his self-made PC. I\u2019d play with my snap circuits set and make the speaker blast the birthday song for hours on end, much to my parent\u2019s encouragement and slight annoyance. All of these experiences fostered my passion for engineering and ultimately compelled me towards computer science. I realize I want to help others have similar experiences as well, which is why I am most passionate about the pillar of engineering awareness. There are so many amazing people around the world who have a passion for engineering but have never been given the opportunities provided to me and many others to cultivate that passion. I want other little girls like me to be able to play with LEGOS, learn elementary coding websites, and circuit sets while feeling love for what they\u2019re doing. Expanding opportunities to others would allow them to discover their own passion and one day become engineers themselves. SEC\u2019s outreach program to younger engineers aligns with these values.",
            "Question 9": "In my senior year of high school, I and two other students were selected to participate in a machine-learning research project. Despite bounding with excitement into our first meeting, we were met with soul-crushing news: the professor assigned to mentor us had pulled out. Rather than give up, we decided to undertake the task of completing this research project alone. In the coming weeks, we failed repeatedly, continued to pick ourselves back up, and pushed ourselves harder. In the end, we were able to stand in front of our camp and present our findings on which machine-learning algorithm produced a more human-like bot in an obstacle game we\u2019d created.\nOur success didn\u2019t come when we gave our presentation, when we finished writing our findings, or even when we finally completed our project. We found success the minute we decided to pursue our research despite not having a professor to mentor us. We found success when our first idea didn\u2019t work, so we just moved on to the second. We found success when none of us knew how to use Unity or code in the language, so we learned how to use Unity and how to code in the language. To me, success comes when, in the face of adversity, you decide to keep going and push yourself to grow as a person. Success comes when things aren\u2019t going your way, so you make them go your way.",
            "Question 10": "Each summer in high school, I attended a six week math camp called Mathworks. Every night, a group of students and I were tasked with solving a series of difficult proofs. I\u2019d never struggled so much with a problem before and I was scared to ask the others for help out of fear of judgment. And so we sat, in separate corners of the room, silently stewing over the problem sets. Alone, I furiously scribbled on my paper, filled the board with fruitless ideas, took one too many breaks to play with the chalk, and left the session feeling entirely unaccomplished.\nThe next day, I\u2019d had enough. I courageously ventured from my humble corner and asked another member of my study group for help on an Abstract Algebra proof I was particularly struggling with. She graciously accepted my request and detailed her initial approach to the problem. However, she too was stuck on another part. To my surprise, I knew how to continue from where she\u2019d been stuck. After reaching out to the rest of the group, we discovered that each of us thrived in different areas, even viewing the same problems in different ways. Our collaboration exposed us to different perspectives, and our varying experiences helped shape these perspectives. Without my reaching out and communicating with them, nobody would\u2019ve been able to be successful. That day, I understood that collaboration and the consideration of differing outlooks is crucial for development and some problems cannot be solved on their own.",
            "Question 11": "For two years, I served as an officer in my varsity dance team. The epitome of this role was service, both to my team and the surrounding dance community.\nLife as an officer was demanding yet rewarding. A Thursday night found me meticulously poring over every task necessary in hosting our annual regional dance competition. A Friday afternoon entailed Red Bull-fueled late night meetings. A Sunday was spent directing a dance summer camp for elementary students. Throughout all the hard work, I found gratification in seeing the impacts of my service on my team and all the young dancers we worked with.\nThis role increased my understanding of the significance of dedication to others, and the idea that service is the backbone of a strong community. Prior to my leadership role, I never fully comprehended the true value of servant leadership. I now understand it means taking initiative when nobody else does, taking action without the promise of recognition, and constantly considering what\u2019s best for the communities I\u2019m impacting.\nI strive to continue serving those around me and carry on my passion for service through magnifying my impact in different communities. I believe I can do so through SEC."

            "Question 8": "The SEC mission statement that means the most to me is to be a representative voice to all engineering students.\nIn high school student government, I had the honor of representing over 2000 students, ensuring each person's opinions were heard. My favorite memory occurred during a meeting where we listened to ideas from students. One student from our special needs program presented an idea about hosting a music competition during lunch. The idea entailed a bracket system where every week two people would compete, and the people would cheer for who they thought won. While he was nervous and stumbled over his words, I loved his idea and it was highly successful. We eventually used this idea multiple times after that and made it a semi-regular event.\nSeeing an idea like this come to fruition filled me with joy, and to continue to be a spokesperson for underrepresented students at A&M would make me even happier. In SEC, a committee like legislation where I can help to present valuable data to uplift the student body around me would be a perfect place to be a representative voice to my fellow engineers.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer, a close friend and I decided to design a drone to apply Aerospace Engineering principles to hands-on-experience. Designing a drone from scratch was difficult, and my partner and I encountered many challenges. Although we both put forward our best effort, we did not have enough knowledge to fully assemble and fly the drone.\nWhile we were not successful in fulfilling our goal of creating a functional drone, the experience was still highly valuable. I learned essential skills in machining and troubleshooting that I would not have learned otherwise. With this newfound knowledge, I plan to conduct further research into drone construction and flight dynamics in the future so I can continue to work on the drone and complete the project.\nUltimately, success is not defined by just achieving the goal you initially set out for yourself. Rather, it is in the lessons that you learn and can take away from the experience. As an aspiring member of SEC, I hope to work on projects where I can apply these principles to remember that even if the goal is not fully realized, the wisdom learned along the way can help to make great products in the future.",
            "Question 10": "During my first year of college, I joined FEST, a freshman leadership organization. Through this organization, we participated in many fun events. One of my favorite events was the FLO Bowl. In the FLO Bowl, all of the male members of FEST competed in a dance and cheerleading routine to be performed in front of hundreds of people.\nGoing into FLO Bowl practices, I had no dance experience. I was nervous because my coordination and rhythm were severely lacking. Further, our coach had extensive dance experience and very high expectations of us. However, all of the guys on the team were also new to dance, so encouraging each other to step outside our comfort zones made the experience so much more fun. The supportive environment allowed our team to grow together, eventually leading us to a third-place finish at the event.\nAfter competing at the FLO Bowl, my perspective on teamwork was transformed. This experience revealed how in uncomfortable situations, relying on those around you can give you confidence you would never have achieved individually. In SEC, we will get faced with events like the career fair or industry night that seem like they are impossible to handle. However, with the combined effort of a team all working towards the same goal, I truly believe that I can produce results that make a real difference in the lives of thousands of engineers at A&M.",
            "Question 11": "During high school, I worked with a company called Life Stream. Life Stream organizes a blood drive once every quarter attended by over 250 students and staff. While I donated blood, my favorite part of the drive was working behind the scenes to ensure it went smoothly. For example, offering food to the nurses, working in the canteen, and talking to students about their experience donating was highly impactful. These personal interactions with the individuals making the drive possible allowed me to realize that my work was having a tangible impact on the community.\nSpecifically, a highlight of my experience as a coordinator was interacting with a hospital administrator. One of the days we ran a blood drive, he came up to me and expressed his gratitude and told me all about how the work we were doing was actually saving lives. I felt so proud to make a positive impact on my community, and I want to continue to give back to the community here at A&M. Through SEC, I would be honored to participate in philanthropy events to bolster the community and influence the next generation of engineers."

No one knows more than engineering students the difficulty of challenging classes, competitive recruitment cycles, and maintaining a fulfilling college experience that we as engineers face. Because of this, it is vital that engineers have a platform where they feel like they are taking part in solving these issues they face. For me, the SEC has been that platform, and it would be a privilege to contribute to fostering the inclusive environment I have enjoyed. In a department with more than 20,000 students, it's inevitable for issues to arise, but one must remember that each of those students is not just a number, but a unique perspective. Ensuring they feel heard creates a more engaged, satisfied student body that can reach its full potential. At my first Industry Night, I assumed it was just another TAMU-sponsored event, but to my surprise, it was almost entirely student-ran. When I was asked for feedback on how to improve it, I realized the power of giving voices to thousands of incredibly bright minds. When that many brilliant people collaborate, real change is not just possible\u2014it\u2019s inevitable.",
            "Question 9": "During my freshman year, I set the goal of winning TAMU\u2019s HowdyHack competition. Confident in my coding ability, I believed I had the skills to win a beginner-level competition. However, once the competition began, I encountered several unexpected challenges. Having never worked on a large-scale coding project, I struggled using collaborative coding tools such as Git. This poor communication with my teammates led to persistent bugs we couldn\u2019t fix, and as my frustration grew, I felt my goal slipping further away. Recognizing our current approach wasn\u2019t working, I chose to redefine my goal. I made the bold decision to lead my team in changing our tech stack, despite being halfway through the competition. While this meant scrapping everything we\u2019d made so far, my teammates worked better with the new stack, which improved our workflow, communication, and troubleshooting. Although we didn\u2019t win, our final submission was a creative solution to a difficult problem, and I was proud of what we accomplished. I\u2019d poured hours of work into the product, and yet I felt successful despite not reaching my original goal. The experience of adapting to new technologies and working effectively as a team taught me more than any first place prize would have. I knew these skills would help me achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a successful software engineer. These experiences would be invaluable to helping me achieve my long-term goal of being a software engineer, and thus success for me was learning, not winning.",
            "Question 10": "I used to work at an upscale jewelry store in a wealthy part of my hometown. As such, it was common for entitled people to come into the store who had little sympathy for mistakes, leading to a stressful work environment. In addition, my coworker, who used to be helpful, now spent a majority of his shifts hiding in the break room, leaving me to deal with every customer on my own. After a particularly stressful shift, I found him hiding in the break room, and my frustration boiled over as I confronted him. To my surprise, he broke down in tears and explained that his grandmother to whom he\u2019d been close had recently passed away, and he\u2019d withdrawn from social interaction to cope with his grief. I immediately felt terrible for assuming the worst about him and apologized for my earlier tone. He then apologized to me for his behavior, promising to improve. This experience profoundly impacted how I viewed working with others as I realized the importance of empathy in any team environment. Instead of jumping to conclusions, it\u2019s vital to consider what someone is going through. You\u2019re both working toward the same goal, and kindness only helps you both get to where you want to be. By approaching this situation with compassion and patience, I was able to help my coworker get back on track and get my reliable teammate back. Now, my approach to teamwork is built upon the sturdy foundation of mutual support and empathy.",
            "Question 11": "While attending a racially diverse high school, I enjoyed the privilege of meeting people of all different backgrounds, but I saw a disturbing amount of racial discrimination. This prompted my goal to found an organization of promoting discussion and improvements to our campus, creating a more inclusive environment and giving a platform to underrepresented voices in the school. I led open discussion forums for people to tell their story, seek support for traumatic events, and brainstorm ideas on how to fix these issues. Eventually the organization gained enough traction to be heard by the school board, where we successfully lobbied for stricter punishments for racial discrimination actions. Though I never experienced attacks myself, the trust of my organization's members to serve their needs was incredibly humbling, and taught me an important lesson about leadership: amplifying the voices around you. In putting my head down and serving my community, I was able to and leave a lasting impact of positive change at my alma mater. This club provided me with little gain on an external level, but the joy I was filled with seeing previously silenced people gain the bravery to stand up for themselves made the service well worth it."

Texas A&M\u2019s college of engineering is one of the largest in America, which creates a unique and diverse environment of engineers. With that, though, it makes it all too easy for the voice of individual students to get lost. SEC provides a structured means for students to ensure their ideas are being represented. While it would be easy for SEC to just ensure their own members' voices are heard, the council prioritizes the engineering student body as a whole, ensuring that all students feel valued.\nI personally believe in this pillar also due to its relation to fostering a community full of unique perspectives. I moved states multiple times in high school, and being in such different environments really allowed me to appreciate new perspectives. What I\u2019ve realized from experiencing these different places is that society thrives as a melting pot. Every single engineering student has a unique perspective based on their life experiences that culminates in their ideas and feedback they can provide the college. When you open this opportunity up to almost 20,000 students, it paves the way for positive, lasting change.",
            "Question 9": "My junior year of high school, I had just moved to a new school and was looking for ways to get involved. Mathematics was by far my favorite subject, with its multitude of applications and its potential to model nearly any scenario. While my last school had a math club I had joined, this school had no math extracurriculars. After realizing that, I made it a goal to start a math club myself. Originally, my definition of success was merely to start a legitimate organization and accumulate at least a few members\u2014small things to get it up and running. From there, I created flyers, advocated for the club on social media, in announcements, and in classrooms, and roped all my friends I could into it. I then worked with a teacher to recharter the organization with the national math honor society. The club was official, and I started weekly meetings and got the club involved with a number of national and local competitions. At this point, I was more than satisfied with my previous goal and set a new goal to reach 30 members (which I completed the following year). While originally my definition of success was deliverables, I shaped that definition after I had accomplished my goal. After seeing how I was able to increase math participation in my school and provide an avenue for advanced students to showcase their skills, I changed my definition of success to being able to positively impact those with similar interests as me.",
            "Question 10": "Over this last summer, I had the opportunity to work as a research intern with the Houston Methodist hospital. Once there, I was placed in a research environment with mostly PhD students in their 20s. I worked closely with one of the PhD students, who taught me a lot about being a mentor. She was always available for a question, always willing to help, and very communicative about what\u2019s expected of me. While the difference in knowledge was quite apparent, I felt like a peer working with her, and I appreciated that deeply. On the other hand, the lab\u2019s principal investigator was quite quick to react and often took an agitated tone. While I can understand the difficulties that lie with that position, it was very intimidating at times. Both these experiences shaped my perspective on how to work with others given a power dynamic. From my first mentor, I now have experience to use whenever I\u2019m put in a mentorship position, utilizing patience, clear communication, and kindness, along with the EDGE method of learning. From my PI, I took away that no matter how high up in a position I\u2019m in, no matter how bad my day was or how overworked I am, I will always treat my colleagues with respect and with a calm temper. People often judge organizations/companies/etc. based on interactions with people in them, and good interactions can leave lifelong impressions of those groups, as Houston Methodist left with me due to my mentor.",
            "Question 11": "A time I had served others is when I served as a den chief in Boy Scouts. This role involved joining the leadership of a cub scout pack (grades K\u20135) to help serve as a middleman between the kids and the adults. I did the technical parts of this role, teaching basic scouting knowledge in the smaller meetings, helping run the large group meetings, and attending campouts and service events with the kids. More than anything though, I talked with all the kids and was able to relate and laugh with them. The feedback I got at the end of the 3 years was truly heartwarming, with the kids telling me that they had wanted to quit the program, but I was the main reason they continued, and parents telling me that I was a great role model for their kids. I think being put in a position like that, you have to realize it\u2019s more than just doing a job, it\u2019s positively influencing the lives of kids looking up to you for guidance. I want to continue making lasting relationships with younger kids looking for guidance, and the Envision Conference would be a great way to continue that."

            "Question 8": "Of the three pillars in the SEC mission statement, serving as a representative voice strongly resonates with me. This pillar stands out to me as it emphasizes addressing and advocating diverse perspectives and needs for students. While the previously held Engineering Town Hall successfully allowed students a platform to share their thoughts and ideas with representatives of the college, I would be interested in continuing to improve upon this newly implemented event through the brainstorming process. Through this event and others like it, I can help to facilitate student representation, allowing voices to be heard, something which I believe is necessary to improve the student experience.\nEffective representation is critical for success as students receive the opportunity to share their needs, challenges they are facing, and aspirations they hope to accomplish. Goals are achieved through increasing resources to help accommodate, and cannot be done without realizing how to provide support. Having a platform to voice these concerns can significantly impact a student's social, professional, and academic journey. By serving as an active representative for the students in the College of Engineering through SEC, I aim to facilitate meaningful connections, advocate for students' needs, and contribute to a supportive environment.",
            "Question 9": "In the past, I defined success solely by my tangible results; however, now I have learned there is much more to goals than this. Now, I view success as feeling fulfilled while also being able to create an impact on the things I am passionate about.\nAt age five, I began piano lessons, and over the years, my journey was more than just learning music. Originally, my objective was to just keep learning new pieces, but my piano teacher\u2019s abundance of knowledge introduced me to a realm of creativity that inspired me to spread the same passion to others.\nAs I became older and began teaching piano, my main goal wasn\u2019t just to share my technical musical skills; it involved sharing joy in exploring their interests while creating an environment where students are encouraged and supported, just like my teacher had done for me. Success, for me, was reflected through their growth in music and the enthusiasm that similarly impacted me. Every new song a student learned marked their progress and I felt rewarded for sharing this passion with them. I discovered that measuring success isn\u2019t always necessarily through quantifiable values, as proven by the fulfillment I felt in guiding others and the positive influence I could have on others. My shift in perspective of valuing personal fulfillment has redefined how I set and accomplish my goals. Through this, I learned that true success is making a positive difference and encouraging growth for myself and others.",
            "Question 10": "As a young child, I spent many mornings learning to swim and even felt terrified of approaching a 13-foot-deep end. In my high school career, I became a swimming teacher and through this, I recognized a glimpse of myself in the children I taught and sympathized with the worries they faced. I eased their fears and put a smile on their faces by mentioning that they were swimming in pools of their favorite ice cream. I felt rewarded for passing on my knowledge to others and inspiring the youth to achieve their goals in the same ways my teacher did for me.\nThis experience helped to change my perspective when working with others. When working with children, patience, kindness, and encouragement are crucial to help motivate students to learn how to swim. Although it was initially difficult to work with younger children, perseverance was essential when striving for progress. Since each student had a unique way of learning, effectively adapting to each student was vital to support them. I noticed that even simple acknowledgments of small advancements can motivate them, contributing to their ultimate larger goal. But, like any other team, in a broader sense, it is important to be encouraging so that the team has a safe space to share their thoughts and ideas. Through this, my perspective when working with others was shaped as I understood that with all teams, a positive environment creates a productive environment, helping to result in collective growth and personal success.",
            "Question 11": "The true message of serving others often becomes lost in the translation between routinely packaging food and mundane work. Yet, a heartwarming story of a food bank worker sharing his experiences with food insecurity changed my perception of what it truly meant to serve my community.\nDetermined to create a greater impact, I became more involved, discovering just one hour can significantly affect someone's life. Involving in a youth chapter allowed me to have a larger influence. It was rewarding to organize my own service projects while also incorporating one of my favorite hobbies\u2014gardening. I found that I could help to serve the community while still enjoying and pursuing my passions. I learned that community support is valuable, leading me to spend months planning a fundraising project spanning North Texas, impacting thousands of families. I realized that serving others was more than advocacy and awareness but also connecting with others to create lasting change. As I became more involved each year, I noticed the strong impact I had on the community. Gaining a deeper understanding of the issue allowed me to create meaningful differences and turn my visions into reality through long-term service projects and raising awareness about food insecurity."

            "Question 9": "As a freshman, I approached my first career fair with apprehension and hesitance. My primary goal was to establish meaningful connections with recruiters aiming to create a recurring presence that would benefit me in future career fairs. In addition, I believe creating a strong foundation was essential for developing a network that could support my professional growth. After numerous conversations, my efforts resulted in three interviews and one offer, which I chose to accept. With this, success was not defined by the offer; it was defined by the preparation and drive that enabled me to capitalize on the opportunity and present myself effectively. This process has allowed me to approach short-term and long-term goals, helping me advance personally, academically, and professionally and be resilient in the obstacles that may come my way. This experience has inspired me to support others in a similar journey.

For example, assisting in career development workshops such as those focused on resumes and elevator pitches allows me to help refine professional skills. My definition of success entails overcoming fear and uncertainty as these emotions allow for an opportunity to seize growth. Helping others who may feel the same apprehension provides an environment to strengthen confidence and develop professionally.",
            "Question 10": "In a fundamentals of design course, we were tasked with a semester-long project that entailed designing a business-card holder and forecasting financial implications. In a team of four, differing and conflicting ideas arose throughout the design process and led to numerous stalemates. In order to advance, we had to reach a compromise and find a solution that satisfied our stakeholders. While members of our group felt that our personal ideas may have sufficed in targeting respective areas of the project, we learned to set aside our opinions and appreciate the diversity of thought that came with working together. I became more adaptable and learned that leading isn\u2019t about pushing a single vision but about facilitating collaboration to leverage the group\u2019s goal. The importance of collaboration and consistent communication across our delegated teams helped shape my mindset and approach to future group work. Instead of attempting to vet personal ideas, my team sought to play to our strengths and converge our ideas into a more cohesive and versatile idea that capitalized the full potential of our team. My approach to teamwork emphasizes communication, adaptability, and compromise, fostering flexibility and collaboration to achieve the best outcome. This approach has encouraged me to seek leadership opportunities, where flexibility and facilitating collaboration is key in leveraging the strengths of each team member. I want to create an environment where my peers can develop and be innovative in the ideas they present for individual and organizational success.",
            "Question 11": "Throughout my time in high school, I had the chance to assist a youth soccer team of ages eight to nine. Having a passion for soccer, this gave me the opportunity to mentor young kids and develop their skills in an activity that I find fulfilling. With young athletes comes the responsibility of patience, encouragement, and a need for a basic framework of skills. Assisting the coach included guiding drills and breaking down activities to help the kids gain confidence in their abilities. Fulfillment came from working with the kids one-on-one, seeing their excitement rise as they saw progress in their skills, and receiving positive feedback from their coach and parents. Encouraging them through their struggles allowed me to see their progress throughout the season and remind them of the growth they were undertaking. Playing a role in that gave me pride and emphasized the impact of mentorship and the development that applies to our youth. The EnVision Conference provides me the opportunity to apply principles of mentorship by developing our youth and empowering them to pursue a future in STEM. By inspiring the next generation, I am honing essential skills for professional advancement, including guidance, teamwork, and fostering innovation."

            "Question 8": "Fostering professional advancement means a great deal to me as I have faced struggles navigating the American professional sphere, so I know personally just how powerful this pillar is. I come from Iraq, where the British-based education system has little similarity with the American one, so as the eldest child of an immigrant family, it was difficult to find my way forward. I felt like I was always learning things past their expiration date for relevance.\nI then joined the two organizations that taught me the most: Robotics and Future Health Professionals. There, I was finally able to gather the first useful information towards a successful US career, showing me the first steps into the robotics and medical fields. Nudges from mentors and organizers led to me taking my first steps into engineering, but many haven\u2019t had the same opportunities. Professional advancement holds the most weight in my career, and its underscored importance in college drives me to help and give back so others may have opportunities to move forward in their careers. I look forward to helping others in navigating their careers as I was helped, through SEC as part of the Engineering Development Committee.",
            "Question 9": "As a lover of running, I came to college expecting I\u2019d be putting in the same weekly mileage I did in high school. However, ETAM and the growing pains of being a freshman blocked my return to my daily four miles or more. When I went back home this summer, I tried to return to running, but being weighed down by new responsibilities and nearly a year of Commons food left me in a difficult spot.\nMy goals had to evolve and adapt. I had started running to meet people and stay healthy, but it changed over time into competition. My new situation called for a return to form. My training regimen and its high expectations needed to be shifted to something achievable, manageable, and stable so that I could continue running and stay healthy. My success was therefore defined by consistency and moderation. I\u2019ve since kept my runs short and sweet, focusing on form rather than on power or speed. I am proud to say that with this new plan, I\u2019ve been running consistently these past few weeks, and to me, that is the definition of success.",
            "Question 10": "This summer, I interned at TxDOT and worked on the first step into the intelligent transportation future: variable speed limits (VSLs), LED speed limit signs which can change the number they display. Using TxDOTs weather and crash databases, I developed an AI time-forecasting model that used the data to decrease the speed limits depending on risk factors.\nMy coworkers, who were unfamiliar with AI, would ask me how it worked. To explain I used a video game analogy which I had used a lot previously with other computer science students. Unfortunately, this analogy only worked for people who played video games, so I needed to change my approach if everyone was to understand.\nThroughout the week, I learned everyone\u2019s interests and formulated relevant explanations tailored to them and their teams. This experience taught me that a core component of a successful team is effective communication and knowledge of every sub-team's goal, setting a prime foundation for the following work. Bridging the knowledge gap between me and my teammates allowed us to better understand the project and our roles within it, creating a more collaborative and engaged team dynamic. I know that, as an engineer, much of my future work will be done in collaboration with other engineers from other disciplines who won\u2019t know all the ins and outs of every facet of a project. Going forward, I will ensure that mutual understanding will be a pillar of every team I\u2019m part of, driving all of us faster towards success.",
            "Question 11": "For two years, I volunteered at the Austin Heart and Stroke Walk. After the initial setup for the race was complete, I was tasked with providing a positive and welcoming environment for the participants in the Walk. Pom-poms in hand, I cheered on every participant that walked by. It was heartwarming to see them smile at the support and push forward a little bit in response.\nI was amazed by the impact a few hours of work had on the joy of hundreds of people that day. The efforts given by myself and the other volunteers developed a small community right there and then, one of camaraderie and friendship. That is the true joy of service \u2013 inspiring others to keep on moving forward, helping them on their journeys, and building relationships with the community. These experiences have deeply inspired me to continue volunteering, knowing that my actions contribute to something larger than myself and foster lasting connections that strengthen communities with every step forward. SEC is the greatest driver of service within the College of Engineering, and the opportunity to contribute to that calls to my passion for volunteering and community service."

            "Question 9": "My goal was to train my bunny to perform tricks like jumping through a hoop, doing circles, and giving high fives. Success to me meant that she could perform these tricks consistently and enjoy the process. However, the journey had many challenges. At first, she would mix up the tricks. There were even times when she seemed more focused on the treats than the actual training, often trying to \"cheat\" by doing part of the trick to get her reward, like completing a loop around one leg instead of both. This made it difficult to keep her focused and follow through with the entire process.\nThese challenges tested my patience, but they also helped me grow. I had to adjust my training techniques to be clearer, stay consistent, and develop ways to keep her engaged. It was essential for me to remain calm and persistent, even when progress was slow or inconsistent. Over time, I not only saw improvement in her ability to do the tricks, but I also became a more patient and effective trainer.\nFor me, success wasn\u2019t just about my bunny hitting the targets, it was about personal growth and building a stronger connection with her. Seeing her enjoy our training sessions and watching her enthusiasm made the experience all the more rewarding. Plus, seeing how much joy it brought to others as she performed tricks made the effort feel truly worthwhile. This experience reminded me that success is not just about the goal but also the journey.",
            "Question 10": "During my IT internship at veterinary clinics, I had the opportunity to work with professionals who weren\u2019t very familiar with computer systems. While the veterinarians and nurses were exceptional at their jobs, they often faced challenges when it came to using the clinic's technology. This experience was eye-opening and significantly shaped my perspective on teamwork and communication.\nI found that much of the staff struggled with the computer systems, which were integral to their daily tasks. To address this, I had to adjust my approach to make sure that explanations were in simple terms and free of technical jargon. It became clear that being patient and clear was crucial in helping others who might not be as comfortable with technology. Although explaining complex systems in an accessible way came naturally to me, I realized how important it was to ensure that my coworkers felt comfortable and confident with the systems they used every day.\nThis experience taught me that effective teamwork involves meeting people where they are and ensuring that everyone understands the basics, regardless of their initial level of familiarity with the subject. It reinforced the idea that clear communication and patience are essential in any collaborative environment. By helping my colleagues become more comfortable with the technology, I contributed to a more efficient and supportive work environment, which ultimately improved our overall teamwork and productivity. This perspective has continued to influence how I approach collaborative efforts and problem-solving in all areas of my professional life.",
            "Question 11": "During my freshman year of college, I began tutoring students in my academy class for free. Many of these students, who are about a decade older than me, were balancing demanding family responsibilities and jobs, leaving them with limited time to focus on their schoolwork. Their dedication to improving their lives despite these challenges deeply inspired me to offer my help. I felt fortunate to have gained my knowledge early on and believed it was important to extend that benefit to those who hadn't had the same opportunities.\nTutoring them has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I\u2019ve seen significant improvements in their academic performance, and many of the students I worked with eventually began to excel beyond my own achievements in certain subjects. Witnessing their progress and growing confidence has been deeply fulfilling. Their success was more than just better grades; it reflected a renewed sense of purpose and hope for their future. Knowing that I contributed to their achievements and personal growth has been one of the most gratifying aspects of this experience. This journey has reinforced my belief in the impact of support and the positive difference it can make in helping others succeed."

            "Question 9": "One of my goals throughout high school was to enter my artwork into the city\u2019s rodeo art competition. I wanted to at least have a chance to showcase my work on a competitive level, even if I did not win. However, I often struggled to accomplish this because I could never finish enough of my artwork in time for pre-selection. This was largely due to my problem with perfectionism, which delayed me because I was often undermining my abilities and obsessing over unnecessary details. I took a break from art for a year before returning in my senior year, ready to try anew. When self-reflecting, I realized I placed too much focus on impressing the judges, instead of working with my natural capabilities. To change this, I took a risk in trying coloring techniques which were not entirely photorealistic, but true to my artistic style. Not only was I entered in the competition, but I was selected for a second competition as well and won. It was not winning or being entered which defined this moment, but how I embraced my abilities through my work process. I did not just grow as an artist, but as a person in taking a risk and learning not to treat my abilities as restrictions. My success came from my journey of personal growth, where I learned how to reflect on my failures, and implement this reflection into a purposeful solution.",
            "Question 10": "I never disliked working with a team, but I often found myself shouldering the brunt of the work. I developed a mindset that communicating this was pointless, because others would often not put in the same effort to complete the task. I thought this would stay the same in college, but a teammate in my math lab group admitted that she struggled to finish the labs because she did not understand the content. This simple act of communication reshaped my approach to working with groups. I made an effort to help her and my other teammate with learning the concept, then encouraged them to attempt the work on their own. If there were any mistakes, I tried to help them find where they went wrong instead of correcting it myself. In a later project I drew from this experience to encourage my groupmates to take initiative and speak up about their ideas. This motivated them to contribute their share to the assignment, and facilitated a creative mindset for the group because we were actively communicating with one another. I learned communication is a tool for how I can use my abilities to uplift others, and vice versa. I not only became more open-minded, but I learned how to approach working with a team to play to our collective strengths. I want to bring these values to the SEC, where working with others is adapting to new situations together and ensuring that all members can shine in their roles.",
            "Question 11": "My Girls in STEM club in high school hosted a science fair for hundreds of elementary school students twice a year. We would invite other student organizations to participate, and our most popular station was tie-dying clothes which was hosted by an art society. Because of its heavy traffic, having many volunteers was necessary to facilitate it, but there were not enough. Though it was not my original position and I had no experience with the station, I volunteered to assist them because I knew they were overwhelmed. I worked with the other members to streamline the process of dying t-shirts, including reorganizing the number of people responsible for each individual task so more people were working on the parts that took the longest. My assistance not only reduced the workload for the other volunteers, but it also made sure people attending could get through the line quicker so they could go to other stations. This experience was important because I had to adapt and learn a new skill quickly in order for the larger event to function smoothly. Additionally, I assisted in a team effort to adapt to a difficult situation, and improved the overall experience for fair attendees."

            "Question 8": "The pillar of acting as a representative voice for all engineering students most resonates with me. I am currently serving as Recruitment Co-chair of Sling Health, which involves reaching out to students and encouraging them and mentoring them as they complete research, work through the bio-design process, and create a business model. So far, this experience has helped me see the value in advocating for students for the good of their education and college experience as a whole. I have loved meeting students and hearing their stories and goals for the upcoming school year, and being able to plan events around their unique goals. In SEC, this value of supporting students through engineering really appeals to me. A&M is such a large university, and the engineering department is so large; it\u2019s easy for students to feel lost or overwhelmed, especially with engineering being so difficult. I want to make sure that every student feels heard, at home, and welcome. Hearing from students about what events they want to see and how they want to be represented would allow me to give back to the engineering community while helping students find their place in engineering at A&M.",
            "Question 9": "This summer, I completed research at Houston Methodist Hospital as part of a 10-week long internship. At the end of the program, we had to create a poster presentation about our work from the summer. While this presentation was judged as part of a competition, my personal goal was to have a clear understanding of my research and its future impact on peoples\u2019 lives. This understanding would allow me to make a detailed presentation and explain everything to people with no previous background in my topics. I don\u2019t particularly love presentations (public speaking is a skill I\u2019m always trying to improve), so presenting my work to PHDs, physicians, hospital employees, and my peers seemed daunting. My mentor and PI also didn\u2019t speak English very well; I felt unsure of the importance of my research and felt alone trying to figure it out. To better understand my research, I read numerous papers and talked to members of different labs to try to connect everything together.\nAll of the work I put in outside of lab allowed me to have a clear understanding of the implications of my research and create a presentation I was proud of. I considered myself successful when I was able to explain everything to my audience and when I was able to see understanding and appreciation on their faces. I ended up placing 6th out of about 90 interns, but it was explaining the impact of my research to my audience that really defined my success for me.",
            "Question 10": "Growing up, I was always involved in team sports. I played soccer, volleyball, softball, and ran cross country. My love of team environments continued in high school; I joined student council, marching band, debate team, and continued to play team sports. However, it wasn\u2019t until moving to Texas during junior year and starting tennis that I realized the importance of working with others.\nTo me, tennis seemed like an individual activity. I had to motivate myself, encourage myself, and strategize by myself through each and every match. I didn\u2019t enjoy this. I was so used to the contagious energy and support of teammates in other sports that I felt isolated during points. I also felt isolated from my team members; we were constantly competing against each other for spots and I didn\u2019t have the same connections they had amongst themselves from playing together for years. I wasn\u2019t able to play at my best and didn\u2019t have much success.\nHowever, this stopped when I decided to leave my comfort zone and ask my teammates for help. I began to see them as opponents less and less, even though we were still competing. Though difficult, I realized that in order for me to improve, I had to rely on others; you can\u2019t really practice tennis by yourself. I learned to appreciate people\u2019s unique experiences and personalities. This experience taught me the importance of building relationships with people as individuals; a team is built upon this foundation until it becomes a collective unit.",
            "Question 11": "I think my strongest example of serving others is as a mentor. I am currently a mentor to student teams in Sling Health, and am a mentor to multiple freshmen in engineering through the FLO I was in last year. In high school, I served my community as a volunteer tennis coach for young children and I am always willing to give younger students guidance or advice.\nBy volunteering my time to serve younger students, I am helping them figure out who they are now, how they want to grow, and who they want to become in the future. It is really motivating to see people in positions I was once in be inspired to do something they are passionate about or be reassured by certain advice I give them. It is also really rewarding to be able to give back to the community by serving in a role that I myself value as I grow into the best version of myself. In SEC, the opportunity to serve the needs of the college of engineering is really exciting; I\u2019m excited to serve students\u2019 individual needs through events such as E-week and help the college improve and develop as a whole."

            "Question 8": "The SEC\u2019s mission to increase engineering awareness means the most to me because engineers design and create solutions that impact every aspect of our lives. Promoting this career path to young students can inspire a diverse group of future engineers and drive innovation. The SEC\u2019s EnVision conference embodies this idea as it sparks curiosity in young students through engaging events such as the Grand Design Challenge and RoboMasters Demo. Engineers\u2019 Week embodies this idea as well, as it promotes engineering to Texas A&M students through community engagement and celebrating engineering achievements. These initiatives help break down misconceptions about a career in engineering to underrepresented groups who may have not considered pursuing an engineering career path due to a lack of exposure. Having a diverse group of engineers to solve real-world problems brings creativity and innovation. Examples of this include prosthetic limb design tailored to the needs of different demographics, building earthquake-resistant homes in Nepal or Haiti with the help of engineers from the area, or even Microsoft creating an Xbox Adaptive controller for people with disabilities. By increasing awareness, we can inspire a diverse group of engineers who can drive innovative and inclusive solutions.",
            "Question 9": "In my sophomore year of high school I decided to join the tennis team, even though I had never played the sport before. By the end of the year, I wanted to compete with the varsity team and play in tournaments, but I knew it would require stepping outside my comfort zone and extensive practice. I regularly practiced after school with the varsity players and even practiced outside of school on the weekends. I focused on developing disciplined habits and had a rule of practicing at least 10 minutes a day, knowing that what mattered the most was showing up consistently. Setting a minimum practice time requirement helped me avoid relying on fleeting emotions and motivation. Instead, it allowed me to embrace discomfort and be guided by consistency. Over time, my commitment paid off. I earned a spot in varsity tournaments and even was elected team captain my junior year of high school. Achieving this goal taught me real success is defined by consistency, perseverance, and sacrificing comfort for long-term results. I like to think of success as a distant object. I can either stand still, squint my eyes, and imagine what it looks like, or I can simply start walking towards it and eventually find out what it is. To conclude, this experience has shown me embracing challenges and consistent effort brings true success.",
            "Question 10": "Being able to effectively work with others is an essential professional skill. In my sophomore year, I was randomly assigned a lab partner. When I introduced myself to him, he seemed rude, and I was confused as to why. He appeared very introverted, and I initially thought he just wanted to work alone since he gave short answers whenever I tried to communicate with him about our approach to the lab. I became frustrated, but I continued trying to work with him instead of escalating the situation since this was still my first time meeting him. As I kept working with him, I realized that he was not trying to be rude and he was just a bit introverted. We ended up being very productive and I got along with him well. This experience shaped my perspective on assuming how people are simply based on first impressions. Although they are important, people react to situations differently and we cannot simply rely on our initial impressions to judge a person. Two people can perceive a certain behavior very differently. This experience taught me to approach working with others with patience, empathy, and open communication in order to adapt to all types of situations.",
            "Question 11": "In the summer after my freshman year at Texas A&M, I volunteered at a local food drive for children from low-income families in my school district. Inspired by the drive\u2019s mission to combat food insecurity in our community, I contributed by going door to door with my fellow volunteers to raise awareness. Despite my initial nervousness, I communicated effectively with people of various backgrounds and encouraged participation despite their initial skepticism. Together with the volunteers, we distributed breakfast and lunch meals, kept the food cool in the summer heat, and provided over 300 meals a day. I was even able to practice my Spanish speaking skills, as most of the families had a Hispanic background. This experience taught me the value of perseverance and emotional intelligence when serving my community. Engaging with people from different backgrounds developed my communication and problem solving skills, as I found creative ways to increase participation by bannering in community hotspots such as the local grocery stores. Driving change in my community through small, impactful actions can lead to significant change in people\u2019s lives. This experience has shaped my approach to service, emphasizing the significance of collective action and dedication."

            "Question 9": "Throughout middle and high school, I was never the strongest or most physically gifted. Whether during basketball practice or casual meet-ups with friends, I often found that I was never one of the strongest people in the room. Determined to make a change, I set a clear goal during my senior year: to significantly enhance my physical strength through dedicated gym workouts, with a main goal of benching 225 pounds, a benchmark representing the power of routine and dedication. Initially, lifting even lighter weights was extremely challenging, but I maintained focus on my broad goal. I defined success by adhering to an organized training regimen and making gradual, measurable progress. Each workout and incremental increase in weight was a step closer to achieving that target. This experience taught me valuable lessons in perseverance, discipline, and strategic goal-setting. Reaching the 225-pound milestone was more than just a physical achievement; it embodied the dedication and resilience required to excel. This approach to goal-setting and problem-solving is directly applicable to the engineering field, where complex challenges often require methodical planning and strenuous effort. The skills I developed like consistency, strategic thinking, and pushing beyond perceived limits are essential for success in engineering. Just as I tackled my fitness goals with determination, I approach engineering projects with the same mindset: setting clear objectives, applying rigorous problem-solving techniques, and persisting through challenges to achieve impactful results.",
            "Question 10": "One experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was my role in developing a versatile shoe cover as part of a project management team during my senior year design class. The project involved designing a product that could be used to protect everyday sneakers from the elements, requiring coordination between multiple team members with various skills. This project highlighted the importance of clear communication and collaboration. Each team member brought different expertise to the table. Some focused on design, others on materials, and some on functionality testing. I learned that effective teamwork required not only aligning everyone\u2019s contributions but also integrating their diverse perspectives into a cohesive product. A significant challenge arose when conflicting ideas about the design emerged. Navigating these differences required collaboration and compromise. I realized that fostering an environment where team members felt comfortable sharing their opinions and working together to resolve conflicts was essential for the project's success. Ultimately, the experience taught me that successful collaboration involves not just coordinating tasks but also valuing and incorporating diverse viewpoints. It reinforced the idea that effective teamwork is achieved through mutual respect, flexibility, and a shared commitment to the project\u2019s goals. This perspective has since influenced my approach to team-based projects, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and open communication.",
            "Question 11": "As the captain of my high school tennis team, I had the opportunity to serve others in a leadership role. My responsibilities extended beyond performance on the court, including fostering team cohesion and supporting my teammates. A key aspect of this role involved organizing additional practice sessions and team-building activities to enhance both our skills and morale. I managed drills to address specific areas of improvement and facilitated team meetings to discuss strategies and objectives. When a teammate struggled with their game, I provided tailored guidance and encouragement, helping them regain confidence and enhance their performance. This support not only benefited individual players but also strengthened the team as a whole. This experience underscored that effective leadership is intrinsically linked to serving others. It involves actively listening, understanding diverse needs, and cultivating an environment where every team member feels valued. By focusing on the development and well-being of my teammates, I learned that successful leadership is built on empathy, dedication, and a commitment to collective success. This perspective has informed my approach to leadership and teamwork in all areas of my life."

            "Question 8": "I feel the strongest connection to the Engineering Awareness Mission among the three pillars. Being part of Texas A&M\u2019s largest college offers countless opportunities to grow and build connections, but navigating through all the available resources can also feel overwhelming. Many students including my current roommates, weren\u2019t aware of important engineering events like career fairs, E-week, or other campus opportunities until I let them know. This showed me how easy it is for students to miss out on crucial events simply because they don\u2019t know where to look.\nOne of my main goals as a member of the SEC would be to increase awareness about events like Pre-Career Fair Week, which provided me with invaluable advice and preparation for career fairs. These types of opportunities are essential for engineering students\u2019 development yet are often overlooked or not emphasized enough.\nBeing part of an organization like SEC, which has a meaningful mission, would allow me to help spread awareness and career growth resources to both incoming freshmen and graduating seniors. I believe I can contribute to SEC by making sure more students have access to the same guidance and opportunities that helped me, making their college experience more fulfilling and successful.",
            "Question 9": "Last semester, I had the opportunity to work on a collaborative project between the Aggie Data Science Club and General Motors. Our team of four freshmen was tasked with developing a machine-learning model to predict electricity usage for EV chargers, even though I had little experience in data analysis or machine learning. The goal was to create a functional model that could be used nationwide by General Motors. However, we faced several challenges, including limited data on electric chargers, our inexperience in data manipulation, and a tight two-month deadline to present our progress. In the end, we developed a demo version of the model using data from the Colorado region. Though we didn\u2019t fully achieve our initial goal, I walked away with valuable lessons and hope to develop this project further. I learned the importance of seeking help when needed, the value of clear communication, and the necessity of showing up for team collaboration.\nFor me, success isn\u2019t just about reaching the final goal. It\u2019s about the growth and learning that happens throughout the journey. Despite not fully completing the project, I consider it a success because of the personal and professional development I gained along the way.",
            "Question 10": "Since starting college, teamwork has become an essential part of my daily life. One notable experience I can share is during my freshman year in my MSC FLI (a freshmen leadership organization) where I was part of the service subcommittee, Latitude. At the time, I had little experience planning on-campus events, but the older staff members were supportive and willing to guide our freshmen on how to communicate and present our service projects to other FLOs. Their guidance helped me understand the importance of collaboration and effective communication.\nSimilarly, when I was working on my first data science project, my project manager went out of his way to teach our team data analytics and regularly checked in on my progress. His support helped my team successfully build our first machine-learning model, something I thought I could never achieve.\nThese experiences have shaped the way I approach teamwork. I\u2019ve learned that being a proactive team member means not only focusing on my tasks but also stepping up to help others when they need it. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to a struggling teammate or offering guidance, I\u2019ve come to realize that small acts of support can make a big impact. As a member of the SEC, I\u2019m looking forward to taking what I\u2019ve learned and using it to help others grow, just as others have done for me. Lastly, I\u2019m excited to continue developing my leadership skills in a collaborative and supportive environment like the SEC.",
            "Question 11": "When I served on the service subcommittee for my FLO, we organized an incredible program called SHARES, a campus-wide clothing and hygiene drive. The items were donated to refugees through a partnership with an organization in Houston. Planning and advertising for the program involved detailed coordination with other organizations and the University, ensuring everything ran smoothly. In the end, we collected over a thousand pairs of socks and underwear. We also organized an FLO-wide trip to Houston to sort the items and create welcome signs in different languages for the arriving refugees.\nDespite receiving no compensation, the meaningful impact of the program kept me motivated to contribute as much as I could. After the program, I realized how rewarding it is to be part of a service initiative that makes a real difference in people\u2019s lives. That experience inspired me to return as a staff member to help the next class of freshmen develop their event-planning skills and organize meaningful initiatives just like I did. My passion for service continues to grow, which is why I sought out SEC, as the organization's missions align closely with my dedication to serving others."

            "Question 9": "Success in a goal for me is broken up into two parts. The first part is the end result, for example if I wanted to lose 10 pounds in a month, my weight at the end of the month would be the end result, and if I lost 10 pounds, the goal would be partly successful, depending on the second part of the goal. The second and more important part is the growth that I gained through the process of pursuing the goal. For the weight loss example, I would consider the second part of the goal successful if I was able to build and implement the correct weight loss routine and habits that would benefit me in the long-term.\nThe reason I define success like that is because I have learned through my athletic journey that if I base my success on results, my confidence can take a hit. After many years of dealing with mental battles, I understood that I was overlooking the amount of hard work I put in, and once I began to recognize that, I became more confident and the results followed suit.\nI believe the second part of the goal is so important as many people are very result oriented and don't recognize the growth they encounter through the process of pursuing the goal. Even if I don't achieve a goal, I ensure that I can identify how I've grown through the experience, and how I can try again using what I have learned.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was my time on the Texas A&M Varsity Disc Golf Team. I was recruited on the team right before the national tournament in South Carolina, so I had to compete as a team in another state with teammates I barely knew. Through this experience I learned that if I can be open-minded, self-aware, and adaptable, I can work with anybody.\nSome teammates weren't very welcoming to me as I was a freshman who just joined the team right before the most important tournament of the year. I predicted this possibility before joining and so I knew I had to be open-minded. Whether it was listening to strategy, or advice with my form, I was able to be open-minded which deeply improved the chemistry.\nBeing self-aware allowed me to recognize how my actions and presence impacted the team dynamic, especially as a newcomer. By understanding when to step back or contribute, I was able to avoid any tension and build trust over time, smoothly integrating me into the team.\nAdaptability was crucial, as it enabled me to adjust quickly to new roles and team expectations, ensuring I could contribute positively to the team's success despite the situation. This flexibility not only helped me fit in but also demonstrated my value as a teammate under challenging circumstances.\nMy time on the TAMU Disc Golf Team gave me the perspective that if I can be open-minded, self-aware, and adaptable, I can work with anyone.",
            "Question 11": "A time I served others was when I volunteered at St. John Baptist Church during the holidays, helping to organize and sort food donations to distribute to the homeless. This experience was particularly meaningful because I knew that the effort we put in would directly benefit those in need, bringing them comfort during a difficult time of the year. I was motivated by the opportunity to give back, especially considering the privileges and opportunities I have been fortunate to receive. By passing it forward, I felt a deep sense of purpose, knowing that even small acts of service can have a significant impact on someone's life.\nThis experience was one of the main reasons I wanted to apply to the SEC. I want to continue passing it forward to the engineering community and the entire College Station community. By joining the SEC, I see an opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects that can benefit both students and the wider community. I am eager to collaborate with others who share a passion for service, and I believe that through the SEC, I can help foster a culture of giving back, making a lasting impact both inside and outside the university."

            "Question 8": "Growing up all I really cared about doing after school was going home and playing video games. This wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t care about school, I was still a straight A student, rather it was because I wasn\u2019t exposed to anything else I particularly liked. When eighth grade came around, I was exposed to Robotics as my friends and I participated in a school-sponsored Robotics competition called Seaperch because it meant we would get free food, and fell in love with it. My team and I made it to the international tournament and were flown out by our school to participate. I had no idea that I would ever enjoy something that wasn\u2019t videogames as much as I did until I happened to stumble across Robotics by complete chance. The engineering awareness pillar means the most to me because I\u2019m someone who likely wouldn\u2019t even be in engineering if it weren\u2019t for an event that I just happened to attend.

            "Question 9": "Freshman and Sophomore year of high school I was a very unhealthy and skinny kid which was my biggest insecurity at the time. I was participating in too many activities for my body to handle such as Model UN, Extra curricular volunteer activities, and being on the drumline. By the end of sophomore year I knew I had to make a serious change and concluded that I would have to sacrifice one aspect of my life to take care of myself. This was when I found out the importance of goal setting. The main purpose of powerlifting is to lift as much weight as you can with perfect form. I initially set myself the goal of bench pressing 135 pounds and thought it was impossible. After seeing little improvement I decided to set smaller goals and told myself to aim to add 15 pounds to my max per month and found that goal easier to achieve as it was somewhat realistic - allowing me to stay motivated. By the end of the year I was able to bench 140 pounds (95 more pounds than my start). Despite there being some months where I didn\u2019t reach my goal, I defined success based on if I genuinely did the best I could and was proud of myself as I did in fact push my limits. This entire experience taught me how to set realistic goals and how to properly gauge my success - it depends on how much effort I put in.",
            "Question 10": "Freshman year I was a part of the Aggie Investment Club. This was the first year the club opened a smaller Equity Fund subsection. Members were chosen based on interviews and had to manage $50,000 in an Investment Banker environment. As the only engineer that made it into the fund, I initially found myself a little intimidated because I thought people would ignore my inputs. The first meeting started with a message from the president, Logan, that we\u2019re all there to learn and to not get too emotional about any decisions. This immediately made me feel better. Once we split into our respective teams, I found that people were willing to help me out when I didn\u2019t know something because I was pulling my weight in my own way.\nI quickly found that as someone with a CS background, I knew more about the tech industry than the rest. Because of this, I was able to quickly bring up new and emerging technologies and helped give my team specific companies to look into such as Dollar General based on technological advancements. Despite feeling out of place initially due to knowing less about finance, I learned that teams exist so that people can balance each other's strengths and weaknesses out. If it weren\u2019t for the rest of the team I would be behind the rest of the fund on things such as developing finance models, and if it weren\u2019t for me, the team would miss out on new technologies.",
            "Question 11": "My local temple hosted a personality development curriculum referred to as Prajna. These classes completely shaped me into the person I am today, so after graduating Prajna I signed up to be a TA to pay the deed forward. As a young teenager I understood that these students were forced by their parents to attend, and volunteered to teach the next class in hopes of making it more engaging. The next week came around and instead of going over what was initially planned, I instead went over how much I benefited directly from Prajna and noticed that all the students were actually paying attention. Since that day, I started class with a story about how Prajna helped me in life. Slowly, over the rest of the year students started to engage and participate in the class. At the end of that academic year one kid came up to me and hugged me saying that hearing the way I applied Prajna to my life helped him do the same and excel in school. Due to that one kid I realized that volunteering isn\u2019t about seeing the results, it\u2019s just about helping others. I\u2019m still involved with that organization to this day."

            "Question 8": "My first exposure to engineering fit the stereotypical description. At a 4th-grade summer camp, I was the only girl in a room full of boys. The experience scared me away from engineering as I thought that coding was just \u201csomething that boys did.\u201d\nHowever, at my all-girls high school, I needed a computer science class to graduate. I walked to class, dreading what I thought would be a repeat of my past experience. I was surprised at how much I began to enjoy the class as it progressed. My teacher was passionate and advocated for women in engineering. My classmates and I bonded through study sessions, shared anxiety, and our support system, and I finally thrived in an environment in which I felt I belonged.\nMy experience showed me the importance of engineering awareness. I know that many kids grow up with the same thought process I did; even college students may have these misconceptions. Through SEC, I hope to pay this forward by serving the A&M and BCS communities through opportunities such as volunteering at the Envision Conference or appreciating engineers and their work during Engineers\u2019 Week.",
            "Question 9": "I have played piano competitively from the first grade to my senior year in high school. For much of that time, my idea of success was taking home the title of first place. I wanted tangible evidence that those efforts weren\u2019t in vain. So that\u2019s what I set out to do: I poured in hours of practice every day with my eyes set on a prize.\nIn my freshman year, however, I switched to a different piano teacher who changed the way I understood music. During lessons, we\u2019d sometimes spend more time discussing how to produce sounds that conveyed the ideas and emotions of the composer\u2019s time period, musical style, and overall demeanor. When she gave constructive criticism, it was more than a \u201cPlay louder here!\u201d or a \u201cDid you practice this week?\u201d She told me that each piece had its own story, and I was the storyteller who could add my personal flair into it.\nWhile I still went into competitions hoping for the best, my view of success changed. It was whether I felt proud of the story I just told, my passion for music evident by playing heartfelt music. Now, I define success as the lessons I learned and skills I gained along the journey to achieving my goals. This aligns with and would allow me to add my own touch to SEC\u2019s mission of helping students achieve their ideas of success in their own journeys through engineering.",
            "Question 10": "This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the Houston Methodist Research Institute. I learned a variety of wet and dry lab skills, but one of the most important things I took away from my experience was the tight-knit working environment in my lab.\nAlongside my mentor, I attended weekly lab meetings, brainstorming sessions for RO1 grants, and shadow procedures on the rats in his experiments in addition to working on my project. Through these moments, I observed how each lab member would update any important news or findings from the past week at meetings. I saw my PI check in on everyone, interns included, before delving into the nitty gritty of applying for a lab grant. I felt a sense of satisfaction in helping my mentor with his experiments, even if sometimes, it was simply holding a pipette or two.\nAdditionally, one of the things I noticed and admired about my lab was everyone\u2019s genuine willingness to help their colleagues. Despite having individual tasks, I not only got to witness the specialized knowledge of the lab members but also how they wanted to share that knowledge to achieve the common goal of improving lives. It was inspiring to see how each person played an integral part in the success of both the individual and the collective. This new perspective now drives me to want to create the same sense of community with the people I will have an opportunity to work with.",
            "Question 11": "Saturday mornings were at my local food pantry.\n8 am\u201310 am: The volunteers and I would prepare meals for those scheduled to pick up their food that day. We bustled shopping carts through the pantry\u2019s tiny aisles, filling them with bags stocked with the food items requested by each family. While we sorted and organized the donations, the volunteers, a diverse range of ages, shared stories ranging from past experiences in the pantry to their personal lives.\n10 am\u201312 pm: The pantry became chaotically efficient as we pushed out the shopping carts to each car. While loading their cars, I had the chance to talk to many of the families on a personal level.\nI witnessed volunteers constantly seeking ways to help those in need. When I served families in need, I was moved by their determination and joy despite the struggles they faced. Through every interaction I had, I realized that service isn\u2019t just when it\u2019s a grandiose act of assisting those in dire need; it\u2019s giving empathy and a lending hand to those we may overlook in our own communities. This experience has inspired me to serve others in my daily life, even in the smallest of ways."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that resonates with me the most is the representative voice of all engineering students because I have the courage and confidence to speak my voice when necessary. From my experiences with leadership positions in high school, I learned that not everyone feels comfortable speaking up, especially if they are shy or unsure of how their opinions will be received. In situations like these, I would like to be one of the voices that represents them, making sure that their thoughts are represented with the same importance as anyone else's. For instance, in high school, I was part of a district wide program called VOICES. One of my responsibilities was to collect data on what students considered an issue within the community and propose solutions. As part of SEC, I want to promote a welcoming and inclusive environment for engineers who are looking for that support. I am not afraid to speak up and stand for what I believe in. On top of that, I appreciate criticism and look at it as an opportunity to grow and improve myself. By serving as a representative voice, I want to ensure that every opinion is heard and respected.",
            "Question 9": "Over the summer, out of curiosity and passion for rockets, I decided to build a rocket from a model kit and launch it. My goal was to have a successful launch that would qualify me for my L1 certification. In this process, you have to build, launch, and recover your rocket in a fair condition. During the build process, I was anxious because I had to save money for this project, and I was scared to damage any of the components. During the launch day, everything seemed to go smoothly, and the rocket ascended nicely, the parachute was deployed, and it landed safely. However, the launch wasn\u2019t considered a success until I recovered the rocket and presented it to the moderators. The rocket landed far away in the field, and my dad joined me to help me search for it. After thirty minutes of searching in the field, we finally found it. When we caught a tiny glimpse of the end of my rocket at the field, seeing the pride in my dad\u2019s eyes made the experience even more rewarding. In that moment, I realized that success wasn\u2019t just about the launch itself but also about the journey of taking the risk and believing in myself, the and the shared experience with my dad. His pride and excitement made the accomplishment feel even more meaningful.",
            "Question 10": "During the senior year of high school, I was part of a committee called FBISD VOICES, where I was one of five students representing my high school within the district. Our goal was to host a summit at the end of the year, where we would present our proposals for change to over 500 students, the superintendent, and staff members. One of the important lessons I learned from my experience was the importance of negotiations. Since we had to collaborate with students from other high schools to meet the deadlines for the summit, it was challenging to incorporate everyone\u2019s views on what the summit should look like. From designing flyers, finding a venue, to budgeting the sponsorship money responsibly, I learned that everyone had a unique perspective on how every task should be handled. In such situations, it was necessary to find a solution that worked for everyone. For instance, when we were designing the flyers to promote the summit, some people disliked the logo of the summit, stating that it was not eye-catching. After reconsidering everyone\u2019s inputs, we modified the design such that it represented the main purpose of our summit, and the majority agreed with the final design. From this experience, I learned the value of finding a healthy balance between listening to everyone\u2019s input and negotiating to achieve a solution as a team.",
            "Question 11": "For four years in high school, I was part of the Student Tutor Partnership (STP) Club, and I served as president for three years. Our mission was to provide academic support to students at our high school and a nearby middle school. We organized a team of tutors to help students in various subjects, including math, history, and English. As a tutor myself, I had the chance to help students better understand their homework and class materials. Since every student has a unique learning speed and the way they comprehend the material, I had to change my teaching style to meet the needs of each student, which helped me grow in my ability to explain complex content more easily. I applied what I learned from STP at the Physics Festival, where I presented astronomy-related topics to an audience ranging from young children to parents and grandparents. Explaining complex astronomy concepts to such a wide range of audience made me realize how much I enjoy simplifying difficult topics and making them accessible to others. Through SEC, I want to continue my passion for service by joining branches like philanthropy and motivating younger students to remain curious and become lifelong learners."

Ensuring that every student feels heard fosters a sense of community and belonging. Learning about how the Internal Committee serves this purpose has been eye-opening, and if accepted into SEC, I would strongly consider joining this committee. The surveys conducted by the Internal Committee play a vital role in allowing students to express their opinions and concerns. These surveys are analyzed and presented to the engineering deans and department heads, highlighting the importance of each student's input. It's also essential for students to be informed about events and opportunities within the College to increase awareness and engagement. Communication is vital not only in personal life but also within groups, organizations, and the entire College. Regardless of the group's size, every individual should have a voice, and that is why this pillar resonates most with me.",
            "Question 9": "Over the past two summers, I served as a counselor for Fish Camp, which profoundly shaped my understanding of success. During my first summer, I had no specific goal; I participated to have fun and help incoming freshmen transition into college. Without a clear definition of \"success,\" I simply engaged in the experience. That summer, I met a freshman who later joined the same student organization as me. At our spring retreat, she publicly shared how I helped her find her place on campus and realize Texas A&M was her home. She had considered transferring to another university, but my support convinced her to stay. This revelation deeply impacted me. Motivated by this experience, I set a goal for my second summer at Fish Camp: to leave a positive impact on at least one person. It didn't have to be the entire camp or even my discussion group; helping just one individual would signify success for me. This new definition of success\u2014positively influencing others\u2014has since shaped my everyday life. Success now means making a meaningful difference in someone's life, no matter how small. This perspective has enriched my life, guiding me to prioritize empathy and support in all my endeavors. It redefined success not just for Fish Camp but for my life as a whole.",
            "Question 10": "Throughout my college experience, I often encountered projects or events where either one person dominated without listening to others, or everyone voiced their opinions without reaching an agreement. This made working with others less than ideal, as I found myself on both ends of the spectrum. Despite these challenges, I now love collaborating because it allows me to grow and help others. This change in perspective occurred when I worked with fellow tutors to found a coding summer camp in my neighborhood. During the first summer, we didn't meet our goals: our curriculum wasn't effective, we had fewer participants than expected, and we didn't achieve our desired revenue. These shortcomings were due to a lack of communication, flexibility, and collaboration. Before the next summer, we met to address these issues. We created a new marketing strategy, developed a website to centralize information, and sought input from our community about what they wanted in the camp. By listening, being flexible, and collaborating toward a common goal, we surpassed our expectations the following summer. This experience profoundly changed my perspective on teamwork. I learned that working with others means being patient, appreciating small successes, having empathy, and maintaining proper communication. Because of this, I am now committed to pursuing collaborative work that benefits not just one person but everyone involved.",
            "Question 11": "This past summer, I had the privilege of serving as a counselor for Camp Kesem\u2019s Texas A&M Chapter, a camp for kids whose parents have been affected by cancer. It provides a space where these kids can forget about their challenges and just be kids. Going in, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but past counselors all emphasized how fun and life-changing the experience was. At Kesem, there\u2019s something called \u201cKesem Magic,\u201d and after feeling it firsthand, I understood its impact. Kesem is about being part of something bigger than yourself and creating a supportive community where kids can share without judgment. It\u2019s about standing by these kids through tough, unique circumstances, learning their stories, and providing them moments of joy and happiness. Serving these kids and making their lives a little brighter is what embodies \u201cKesem Magic.\u201d This experience redefined what it means to serve others; it taught me that by positively impacting just one person\u2019s life, you\u2019ve served to the best of your ability. In helping others grow, you also grow and become inspired to keep serving and contributing to something greater than yourself."

It gives equal opportunities to all students no matter what their background may be. Allowing them to be exposed to various fields igniting curiosity and innovation allowing them to find areas they never thought they would have an interest in.\nBy attending a large university especially, it can be quite difficult to navigate all the resources available, engineering awareness gives students a clearer view of what all is available to them. This exposure helps to bridge the gap between potential and opportunity. Bringing these two together makes a huge difference since many will be able to find a passion and in turn make meaningful innovations in their field. Engineering awareness makes sure that all future engineers are provided with the knowledge to solve real world problems, advancing not only their field but society as a whole.",
            "Question 9": "I defined success in a past goal during my internship last summer by focusing on both the outcome and the learning process. My goal was to develop a maze-solving algorithm for search-and-rescue robotics, but success went beyond delivering a functional solution. I measured success by how much I grew in technical expertise, my ability to navigate complex problem-solving, and the quality of collaboration with my team.\nBreaking the project into smaller, measurable milestones such as, researching algorithms, implementing code, and refining through testing, helped me track progress. The real success was not only in the final product but in how much I learned about robotics technologies and in the personal clarity I gained about my future focus in engineering. This multi-faceted approach ensured that the goal was impactful both in the short term, through project success, and in the long term, by shaping my professional growth.",

Throughout this process, I learned how vital it was to ensure that every team member's voice was heard in shaping our approach, ensuring we addressed the diverse learning needs of our audience.\nWe regularly adjusted our materials based on the feedback we received, and each team member contributed ideas that helped improve the workshops. This collaborative environment highlighted the importance of balancing individual contributions while working toward a shared goal. Through this, I realized that effective teamwork is about more than just dividing tasks, it\u2019s about ensuring that all perspectives are understood and integrated, enhancing the outcome. This experience taught me that valuing different viewpoints and fostering open communication creates a more unified team effort.",
            "Question 11": "One of my most meaningful experiences was being able to work with Thirst Project, a non profit organization focused on building wells in countries that don\u2019t have access to clean drinking water.

Thirst Project focuses on developing countries such as Guatemala, Uganda, and Kenya where access to clean water impacts communities dramatically, improving health, which in turn impacts education and economic stability as well.\nMany of the events I organized focused on the global water crisis\u2019 impact on women and children in particular. By connecting with many of the local politicians and schools in the area, we were able to raise funds to support the construction of wells in the Kingdom of Eswatini. Working with this organization introduced me to some of the most hard working people I know, who showed me the power of collective action and the importance of improving other people's quality of life. I was able to contribute to a global cause and was taught the value of empathy and how to use resources to make a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives."

Therefore, of the three pillars, professional advancement is the one that resonates most with me as it fosters unity and pushes each student to become the best version of themselves. Thus far in my undergraduate career, I have honestly found my focus on professional development to be minimal, which is something that I wish I could go back and change. I wish that I would have attended more professional workshops and career fairs earlier on, as I felt very anxious when talking with recruiters and employers when I began to attend these events. After talking with friends, I have realized that my experience is not unique, and that many of my friends share the same sentiments, wishing they had devoted more time to this aspect of their college career earlier on.

            "Question 9": "As most engineering students are, I am very driven by academic success. I have found that most of the goals I have set for myself in the past have been based solely on a number I earned or an achievement I have completed. Last school year I challenged myself to work towards a goal that did not involve numerical success, but one that focused on the cultivation of friendship. As a sophomore, I served as a staff member of a FLO. I made it my goal to be a mentor, to be the person my freshmen felt comfortable coming to to celebrate their successes and to comfort them through difficult times. For the first time, I had set a goal for myself in which success could be quantified in a cut and dry manner, but that only could be measured by the intangible impact I had on others. It was not until the very end of the year that I felt I had succeeded in this goal as I had grown in true friendship with the freshmen and found that they would confide in me in good times and bad. Fostering that true friendship with them and being there as a strong mentor they could always come to is one of the things I am most proud of thus far in my college career. Through this goal I discovered truly how important relationships are and how important it is to show up for others in times of need and celebration.",
            "Question 10": "Last year, I was in a class in which all assignments were to be completed in groups that remained constant throughout the semester. My teammates were randomly assigned to me, and I did not know any of them prior to this class. To complete assignments, we started by assigning each person a few problems from each homework assignment and coming together before class to check over and combine our work. However, quickly we found this system was not effective, as one member of our group consistently did not do his portion, and if he had done it, it was oftentimes incorrect or illegible. My two other group mates and I became frustrated with him and with ourselves, as it felt as though we were barely getting the assignments done. Because of this, my two group mates and I decided to talk with our fourth member. We approached this situation with kindness and understanding, and aimed to pose the issue in a way that highlighted the fact that we all, the fourth member included, would benefit from being more organized and prepared when we met as a group. He agreed, recognized his lack of timeliness, and apologized for not being more prepared. From then on, we communicated in our group chat and delegated problems within our group based on each person\u2019s strengths and weaknesses rather than randomly assigning them. From this experience, I learned how crucial it is to foster consistent, respectful communication when working on a project in a team.",
            "Question 11": "Two summers ago, I worked as a camp counselor at Camp Ozark, a summer camp in Mt. Ida, AR. At camp, I was assigned to lead a cabin of sixteen and seventeen year old girls. I became good friends with these girls and engaged in deep conversations with them over the course of the two weeks they were at camp. With these girls being some of the oldest at camp, topics brought up in the cabin during devotional times were very mature or heavy, and I found facilitating these conversations to be particularly eye opening. These girls each had their own stories, and for a lot of them, they found camp to be a safe environment in which they could open up. They would often ask for advice on difficult situations or simply just ask for me to listen. In this role, I served these girls by practicing intentional listening, because in a lot of cases, I was the first person they had truly opened up to about difficulties they were facing back home. From this experience, I learned how important it is to step back and listen, and how each person\u2019s life experiences shape them into who they are."

I chose to focus on the annexation of Hawaii and began my research early in the semester. I knew that the paper not only was the defining grade of the class, but would be the defining experience too.\nFor me, success wasn't just about getting a high grade; it was about producing something I could truly be proud of. I defined success by my high levels of dedication and the depth of my research. I spent weeks reading books, articles, and personal accounts, and I gave myself ample time to refine my work. When it was finally time to turn the paper in, I was incredibly proud of the work that I had done and the time that I had put into it.

            "Question 10": "During my internship with a civil engineering agency, I often collaborated with two other interns from different disciplines: civil engineering and industrial distribution. As a materials engineering major, our diverse academic backgrounds often lead to varying outlooks on projects. We frequently collaborated on making changes to company plans to accommodate for things such as greater project scopes or changing budgets. These change orders required detailed justifications, including scope, items, cost, and plan sheets. While some change orders manageable individually, many required a collective effort. The civil engineering intern, equipped with skills in CAD programs learned in his classes, focused on creating and updating plan sheets. The industrial distribution intern and I managed the extensive item and pricing justifications. This division of tasks allowed us to leverage our respective strengths and effectively address the complexities of the change orders.\nThis experience highlighted the importance of diverse perspectives and skill sets in problem solving. Our combined expertise was crucial for tackling larger and more intricate tasks. The process underscored how teamwork can enhance efficiency and impact, as we were able to quickly deliver more comprehensive and accurate solutions together than we could have individually. This experience emphasized the value of integrating diverse viewpoints and skill sets to achieve success. It reinforced the idea that effective collaboration is able to solve complex problems while fostering professional growth and success.",

I made sure that my younger cousins were engaged in the moving tasks, decorating and organizing to get their minds off of the situation. We wanted to ease the immense burden that my aunt and uncle were facing and allow them to focus on my cousin's recovery. This experience was incredibly moving, and I was grateful to be able to assist my cousin's family in a crisis. I learned the importance of coming together to support those in need and was deeply moved by how collective efforts can transform a devastating situation into a testament of resilience and care."

            "Question 9": "While setting a goal, I ensure I can measure my progress and completion. This keeps me motivated and shows if I am on the right path. I define success as achieving my goals. A recent significant goal I accomplished was purchasing and renovating a house. This was a huge lifelong ambition for me that initially seemed daunting, but breaking it up into smaller goals and those smaller goals into more specific tasks made the process extremely rewarding. I defined this success by taking things step by step and celebrating small victories keeping me motivated as I saw my progress. I broke this goal up into many smaller goals such as saving up money for the down payment, budgeting for renovations, and saving funds for furniture. I had measurable goals whether it was reaching a savings milestone, completing renovations, or furnishing a room. These goals made it easy to define progress and success throughout the different stages of this process.\nThis was one of the most intimidating things that I have approached but I learned that setbacks are a part of the process and adjusting my plans without losing sight of my end goal was crucial. Achieving this goal taught me that success is not just about reaching the finish line but also about adapting to challenges, learning from each step, and celebrating each victory no matter the size. By defining my goals clearly and celebrating each achievement, I found a greater sense of fulfillment and resilience in my accomplishments.",
            "Question 10": "This past year I was working on a personal project that converts plastic water bottles into filament for 3D printers and ran into a block in which I needed funding. I presented my project to my freshmen leadership organization, which provided funding with a caveat that I had to make it a group project with 10 other members. This was a challenge since it was originally designed to be a personal project and bringing on 10 new people would be difficult since I wanted to provide them with a didactic experience. I Co-led this project with one of my FLO\u2019s mentors, his leadership was extremely impressive. I was struggling to delegate work and keep it interesting but seeing how he managed 10 people on such a small project with not that many parts, yet ensured that every person was on task and most importantly that they felt like they had an impact on the project was impressive. This caused morale to be high and ensured that we worked together as a team. Co-leading this project with him has opened up my perspective and has shown me the importance of not just delegating tasks and collaborating but of defining roles carefully and ensuring that the group is progressing but also feel that they are progressing ensuring that morale is high which pushes work to be higher quality. His leadership style showed me the importance of communication, empathy, and positive team culture, which are lessons I carry into every collaborative project.",
            "Question 11": "In High School, I was a swim instructor, and one of my students with special needs was terrified of the water. I had worked with students with disabilities before but he was different. He was taller than me and most instructors were afraid to teach him as he kicked and swung, refusing to enter the pool. In the first class, we spent nearly the entire time trying to get him to sit down in the water and get accustomed to it. Each week I learned more about him, what worked best for him, and how to comfortably and safely push him to improve while making sure he had fun and felt safe, learning and avoiding his triggers while gently exposing him to his fears. His progress, though subtle to others, was amazing to me and his parents. They went from dreading his classes to looking forward to them. The difference between seeing him screaming and not wanting to enter the pool to smiling and waving, eagerly entering the pool is one of my proudest accomplishments. The fact that I was able to make an impact by just being patient and understanding is a lesson that I carry with me."

            "Question 8": "This is the pillar that really resonates with me: \"fostering the professional development of all engineering students within the College of Engineering.\" My academic path has always been not only about building skills but also making sure my peers grow with me. Be it holding leadership positions or tutoring, I have seen how far providing opportunities for professional advancement can go, which parallels with the mission of the SEC.\nRecently, I was selected as a Thermal EOR Research Assistant at the Petroleum Engineering Dept., which I secured through persistence. While I am yet to begin, this role will present me with an opportunity to work with senior researchers in finding advanced methodologies in petroleum engineering, and this knowledge I hope to share with other students. I started working as a Peer Tutor for General Chemistry and developed study plans to improve academic performance among my fellow engineering students.\nBesides academics, in my previous school, I founded the Developer Club, organized seminars, and did hands-on projects for collaborative learning amongst students. In fact, I hope to bring this same spirit to the Student Engineers' Council and contribute toward the professional growth of fellow engineering students.",
            "Question 9": "Previously, I defined success as setting clear, impactful goals that focus on creating lasting value for others. In my previous school, Founder and President of the Developer Club, my aim was to establish a successful coding club that introduced students into game, web, and software development and simultaneously equipped them with practical skills they could carry forward. Success, in my opinion, was measured by how the club transformed its members into efficient coders of languages such as C#, HTML, and Python.\nTo this end, I designed the club with a curriculum that balanced practical projects with exposure to the real world. I further arranged seminars by professionals from NYU Abu Dhabi, the University of Waterloo, and Ubisoft in order to offer students insights into future career paths. Probably one of the biggest indicants of success was the first-ever Coding Fair, organized for the club, which attracted over 60 attendees and allowed students to showcase their projects-a new tradition set for the school.\nFor me, success wasn't defined by the numbers; rather, making an environment where students felt motivated to grow and be creative in their desire to learn how to code, and watching them develop skills and gain confidence was the greatest reward toward watching me on-the-go achieve my goal. Reaffirmation of impact from the club within the student body was seen through several positive reviews by participants and professionals alike.",
            "Question 10": "One of the experiences that really shaped my perspective in working with others is founding the Developer Club in my high school, combined with serving as a Peer Tutor for General Chemistry here at A&M. I worked hard during my time as President of the Developer Club to foster a collaborative environment where students with all levels of coding skills were able to come together and find ways to continue learning and challenging themselves. Whether leading projects and organizing seminars or recognizing the unique strengths of each member, I realized how important it was to make sure everyone's contributions were valued. This was especially so during the first-ever Coding Fair in school, where teamwork was highly essential in pulling off a successful event.\nSimilarly, being a Peer Tutor required working with students who struggled with chemistry, working out study plans that would best suit them and their learning styles. All in all, this job reinforced the importance of adaptability, empathy, and listening when working with others. That is, by recognizing each student's challenges and strengths, I was able to help them succeed academically and build their confidence.\nBoth experiences taught me that effective teamwork and collaboration are premised on understanding, communication, and fostering a supportive environment. Be it leading a club or helping peers, I came to realize that working with people works best when the perspective of each is valued and respected.",
            "Question 11": "The most important time and what counted toward serving others was when I worked as a Peer Tutor for General Chemistry. Many of my students were having a hard time grasping complicated chemical concepts, and soon enough it dawned on me that my role wasn't just helping them pass but actually helping them understand and build up confidence. I made individualized study guides tailored to each student based on their learning style and areas where they needed more practice. No student was alike, with some needing step-by-step explanation, others requiring illustrations, and yet others learning through practice problems.\nThe realization and visible improvement in their academic performance was gratifying. One of them improved his grades by 30%, reaffirming the power of personalized support. More importantly, I have witnessed students approach their studies with fresh determination and self-belief-the true measure of success. It taught me a lesson in service that has stayed with me through every leadership and support function since. In either academic or professional terms, service to others means the enablement of growth and success in one's own light. The ripple effect then occurred when these students started helping their classmates, creating some sort of learning community."

            "Question 8": "Of the three pillars of the SEC Mission Statement, increasing engineering awareness through programs and events resonates with me the most. I am particularly drawn to the Philanthropy Committee, as community service is a passion of mine. Serving as a subcommittee member for the Engineering Honors Executive Committee has been such a rewarding experience, allowing me to give back to the College Station/Bryan community that has been my home throughout college.\nI am especially excited about events like Engineering Day for young students, as early exposure to engineering can be transformative. I remember my own introduction to this field in elementary school, when learning to code simple robots like Sphero sparked my interest in engineering. This inspired me to launch \u201cSTEM Siblings\u201d at my high school, a program where Science National Honor Society members taught elementary school students STEM disciplines through hands-on activities. I\u2019m eager to continue this passion for service and education, and I look forward to Big Event, canned food drives, and more with SEC.",
            "Question 9": "In high school, one of my key activities was being part of the debate team. A significant aspect of being on the team was mentoring underclassmen in public speaking and critical thinking. When I first started, upperclassmen had a big impact on my development as a debater, and I was determined to pass on that guidance by mentoring a group of first-year debaters during my senior year.\nTo prioritize my mentees\u2019 success, I decided to pause my own tournament season and focus on their development. Instead of competing with a varsity team, I competed alongside the novice team to help them grasp the mechanics of debate and offer tips in real time. Seeing my leadership, my coach appointed me Debate Captain, and I felt responsible for helping the novices grow into skilled debaters. This journey consisted of many losses in the beginning, but each one provided valuable lessons. With every round we lost, we understood how to improve our argumentation and public speaking skills. Eventually, the wins came, but I wasn\u2019t sure I had succeeded because they still seemed to rely on me during rounds. It wasn't until the team went to a competition without me and won all their rounds that I realized I had achieved my goal\u2014my team was ready to navigate the debate world on their own.",
            "Question 10": "One of my favorite experiences working with others was in my ENGR 102 group. Although the group was assigned by the professor and none of us knew each other, we quickly became friends and enjoyed collaborating on our group labs. This positive experience shifted my perspective on group work, making me excited for future teamwork in college, which seemed very different from high school, as my group was just as dedicated and committed as I was.\nHowever, my next semester in ENGR 216 proved more challenging. The lab reports were long and tedious, and my group members often didn\u2019t communicate well, waited until the last minute, or submitted subpar work. While the groups rotated for each lab, it was still difficult to work with people who didn\u2019t share the same level of commitment. This experience taught me that not everyone I collaborate with, both in college and in my future career, will have the same work ethic or dedication to the project.\nDespite these challenges, I learned to adapt and find ways to ensure the project still met the requirements. Whether that meant taking on more work myself or repeatedly reaching out to encourage better participation, I had to do what was necessary to submit a quality final product. While working with others may not always be as easy as it was with my ENGR 102 group, these difficult experiences have better prepared me for the real world, where I\u2019ll encounter diverse working styles.",
            "Question 11": "As a Hullabaloo U Peer Mentor, I support freshmen as they transition from high school to college. I meet with each student at least once during the semester to check in on their adjustment, offering advice and guidance. Having been through the same experience just a year ago, I enjoy being a mentor and answering their questions. Additionally, I help plan activities like \"Taco Tuesday\" and a picnic at Aggie Park, fostering a sense of community and connection among the students.\nSelfless service is an Aggie core value that I resonate with, and I\u2019m grateful for the chance to give back to the school and community that has welcomed and supported me. This is why I serve as an Engineering Honors Ambassador, where I introduce prospective students to the Honors program, lead tours, and answer any questions they may have. I also volunteer two hours weekly at the Engineering Honors front office, assisting visitors and ensuring a welcoming environment. Serving others brings me great fulfillment, and I look forward to continuing this commitment with SEC."

        "Questions": {
            "Question 8": "Engineering awareness means the most to me because not having an understanding of available courses for students entering college skews the decision of what students concentrate on. In other words, if a student loves to learn about space and aircrafts, but grew up in a family of doctors, they may dispassionately pursue medicine because they had not been exposed to aerospace engineering concepts.\nGrowing up, I was heavily invested in macroscale (sand) and nanoscale materials, but I was told being a doctor was the only \u201csignificant\u201d job that made money, so I neglected other professional fields. I entered college as a pre-pharmacy student, taking after my father because I was taught that if he could do it, I should be able to as well. After being exposed to the engineering fields that fit my interest in nanotechnology, I realized I had made the wrong decision. I never really wanted to become a Pharmacist.\nWithout exposure to engineering fields through events and friends, I would\u2019ve never found my fit as a materials science student. Having engineering awareness can help incoming students, even students today, realize their passions for the little things can be bigger than they think.",
            "Question 9": "I told myself in high school that I was going to graduate with a 4.0 and attend an Ivy League institution. At the time, success was to \u2018just do it:\u2019 I set a standard for myself and I have to meet that standard. At present, I did not graduate high school with a 4.0 GPA and I am not attending an Ivy League institution, so did I fail to succeed in my goal? If I asked myself 5 years ago, I would\u2019ve said yes; but, after experiencing hiccups throughout my race toward my goals now, I realized success is not a one-way street to completing one\u2019s goal.\nI had defined success as an \u201cend-all-be-all\u201d where if I didn\u2019t complete the goal, regardless of my efforts, I did not succeed. Today, I believe that despite the difficulty of the goal, success is defined by what you were able to accomplish en route to completing your goal. I may not be an Ivy League student who graduated with a 4.0 GPA as a high school senior, but I was able to receive scholarships and attend opportunity events through my efforts toward that goal, which has led me to where I am today.\nSuccess is not defined by how I complete my goals but by the efforts along the way that help me get closer to my goal, even if I may not obtain what I wanted, I learned what I needed to through my experiences.",
            "Question 10": "Before entering college, I stood firm on doing everything by myself because it was easier that way. Throughout my high school experience, I would help my peers learn concepts that I knew, but I did not think it was necessary to do the assignments with them. It was isolating, but I figured that was how older students did well in their assignments because they knew so much already.\nOnce I entered college, I struggled in the first few months with the assignments being thrown at me. I felt overwhelmed and did not have anyone to turn to because I isolated myself from other people. It wasn\u2019t until I began reaching out to peers in my classes and booking library room times to go over difficult concepts together, that I learned I was slowing myself down academically by doing my work alone. An experience that seems trivial, but it essentially changed my life in not only helping peers with assignments but also having peers help me. This shifted my perspective on working with others from \u201cwasting time trying to get on the same page\u201d to brainstorming with peers in coming to a collective understanding. Education works both ways, to lead and to \u201cfollow\u201d.\nAs of now, I have used that experience to cooperate with organizations to mentor middle school students for high school education, educate other college students as a peer tutor, and pick up on communication skills that are usually learned through extracurriculars that I shied away from.",
            "Question 11": "Growing up, I was blessed to be a member of organizations that worked to promote students\u2019 academic growth such as Breakthrough Houston and EMERGE. During that time, I was exposed to a variety of academic materials that prepared me for the next stages of my educational journey. Those experiences had immense impacts on my education and exponentially grew my love for learning, so when I was offered a position as a PreCalculus Peer Tutor for the TAMU Math Department, I jumped on that opportunity to share my love for learning.\nAs a peer tutor, I mentored students in MATH150 for a semester, watching their love for math slightly grow every day made me realize how electrifying it is to have such an impact on other people. Whenever students were confused or couldn\u2019t grasp mathematical concepts, I was able to comfort those concerns and guide them through the process that they needed. I was an aid in preparing students for exams and giving them little tricks that helped me when I had taken the course the year prior. Watching as students began to fully understand precalculus and want to learn more made me love my experience that much more."

Aggie engineers have access to the strongest professional network in the world, and SEC perpetuates a critical role. Through incredible programs such as the career fair, the SEC bridges the successful Aggie engineers of the future with already accomplished Aggies, establishing the network that makes Texas A&M the most unique university. I have reaped so much from these prodigious opportunities, and I feel a compulsion to pass it on to my fellow Aggie engineers. Through the career fair and engineering development events like industry nights, the world of a professional engineering career that appears intimidating, outlying, and impregnable at first becomes so much more grounded. For so many students, the SEC\u2019s emphasis on the professional advancement pillar is their first genuine opportunity to immerse themselves into an engineering career. It\u2019s only right that I put in the work to provide equally fruitful opportunities for my classmates, providing the opportunity to apply their classroom technical knowledge to industry. With my substantial prior corporate relations experience, I believe I have much to contribute to sustain the excellence of these programs and elevate them to new heights.",
            "Question 9": "I\u2019m fortunate to explore a lifelong passion through my lab, where I integrate machine learning models with wet lab pathogen diagnostics research. I entered Dr. Erickson\u2019s group as the only undergraduate at the time, with no delineated roles or promises. I reasoned that my success in the group would consist of simply learning and acquiring as much technical, communication, and interpersonal knowledge as possible. I realized very early on that involvement with the projects was entirely self-driven and self-initiated, and I deliberately created critical connections within the lab to dive in. The time has certainly been earmarked with objective goals of success (running all the necessary cultures by the end of the week, obtaining a target accuracy on a mode), and goal-setting is undeniably an essential aspect of productivity. However, I\u2019ve always primarily been guided by my beacon of passion and thirst for knowledge. If that is pointed in the correct direction, the traditional metrics will take care of themselves, and I\u2019ve already been published after one only summer. I want to bring that drive to the council: I know my plenary compass for wanting to join (a spirit of service to my fellow engineers, and passion to embody and advance the representative voice of engineering), and it will reflect in the promptness, quality, and energy behind my work in my committee. The best work is produced by a powerful overarching goal, in addition to specific benchmarks and a desire to initiate, which I seek to exemplify in the council.",
            "Question 10": "The student leaders chosen for the Brown Scholar UK trip consisted of an eclectic mix of juxtaposing personalities, and I felt apprehensive about how we would work together. We had different visions of the perfect trip, in addition to contrasting leadership styles. To be completely transparent, the planning meetings spurned conflict. However, it was beautiful to watch it dissipate the moment we met the freshmen at the airport. The diversity within our expertises and backgrounds allowed us to supplement each other to facilitate the best possible experience for the freshmen. Disagreements couldn\u2019t interject between our shared desire to provide a memorable, informative, and transformative trip. Through honest and upfront communication, concrete solutions that were mutually beneficial could quickly be devised. Each leader demonstrated exemplary work ethic for trip tasks, amplifying the positive impacts of our effective communication. As we learned how to supplant each other's weaknesses, we greatly deepened our mutual respect. Each freshman could attest to the trip being life-changing. Overcoming our personality differences led us to realize that our whole could be so much greater than the sum of our parts. As a part of SEC, I\u2019m excited to work in a team of diverse and driven engineers with unique perspectives, where we can identify how to best position ourselves to maximize our skillsets. I know that a shared desire to elevate the engineering experience unites committee members, and I trust that I can thrive and contribute mightily in this selfless environment to put on transformative engineering programs.",
            "Question 11": "My non-profit that I co-founded focuses on serving underprivileged children through weekly activities and service trips. This past thanksgiving, I led our trip to New Orleans focused on affordable housing and volunteering for local orphanages. Our cause resonates extremely close with my heart, and I occasionally found it challenging to juggle leading some of the younger volunteers who may not take the service aspect of the trip as seriously as me. From my perspective, service essentially never feels like work; the smiles that emerge on the visages of the people I impact are the most fulfilling and coveted prize I can possibly attain. What discerned this trip from past ones was a conceited focus on inspiring that service mentality on my fellow volunteers. Through inspiring that spirit, the experience was unequivocally elevated for both the orphans and the volunteers. I can bring that leadership experience and service mentality to SEC, as I have a fervor to provide professional advancement, advocate engineering awareness, and embody the representative voice. SEC is such a unique platform with vast resources the truly reinvent an entire professional outlook for Aggie engineers, and I have a passion to do so out of a obligation of service."

Because engineering is such a foundational aspect of society, it deserves to be celebrated and promoted. Engineering is very fulfilling to me because I know I am working towards improving the ways of life for both individuals and communities. It would be very inspiring to be able to share my fulfillment and aspirations with younger kids and introduce them to the concepts of engineering. Educating younger kids about the aspects of engineering is very purposeful and should be promoted. Additionally, because engineering is frequently demanding and stressful, it is important to celebrate current engineers and make them feel valued and worthy of being an engineer. I would love to help engineers feel pride towards their accomplishments and efforts and feel worthy of their degree. Engineering awareness is integral to communities and promoting this awareness is what I value the most about the SEC.",
            "Question 9": "I believe that success can be defined as mental achievements as well as physical. Coming into college as an engineer, I was most nervous for the coding part of my classes. In high school, I took a coding class where I struggled to understand the concepts. Because of my struggle, I took a coding class the summer before freshman year. I learned the basics of Python which helped me start off strong in my coding class, ENGR 102. However, as time passed, the coding projects became more advanced and I struggled significantly. As a result, I dedicated a couple of hours each day to work on my coding assignments so that I never fell behind. Although I was turning in my assignments on time with perfect scores, I still felt unsuccessful because of all the time I was spending on the class. It was degrading to hear classmates bragging about how easy the assignment was while I had spent hours on it before figuring it out. However, I realized that I was still successful. Success changed from how quickly and easily I could complete an assignment to how much effort I was willing to put into my work. The fact that I was this dedicated to achieving my goals filled me with a sense of accomplishment. I have proven to myself that I am capable of putting in maximum effort to achieve my goals. My dedication suddenly became my goal rather than simply getting perfect scores.",
            "Question 10": "Over the summer, I worked at an independent living facility where I was a server in the dining hall. When I first started, I was very closed off in terms of my responsibilities. As a server, I was assigned a section to wait on and I dedicated myself to my section and my section only. I only interacted with my residents and when I finished closing up my section, I left. However, as time went on, I started helping out the other servers and waiting on the residents in their sections as well as mine. As I became even more comfortable in my position, I would help out the kitchen staff as well. When I finished closing my section, I would stay and help out my coworkers until everyone was finished so we could all go home together. I truly felt like part of a team and our staff became more efficient when we all came together to help each other out. In addition, I became close with more of my coworkers and residents as working together brought us together. I integrated myself into each role and after two months of working, I was given the opportunity to train two new staff members. In the past, I had defined teamwork as a group of individuals dividing up a large task into smaller, individual tasks. However, after working at my summer job, I now define teamwork as a collaborative effort where individuals come together to efficiently achieve a common goal.",
            "Question 11": "To answer this question literally, I was a server at an independent living facility over the summer. Our dining hall staff averaged about 80 residents for each meal and as a server, it was my responsibility to wait on each resident, make their drinks and appetizers, bring them the dessert cart, and check in on them frequently. Although my task as a server was important, I believe my most important role was establishing relationships with all of my residents. I knew everyone by name and had established numerous personal connections, including some residents who were Aggies and loved hearing about my experiences at Texas A&M. During the Olympics, our facility put on Olympic games for the residents and on my break, I would join in on the fun and interact with the residents. Seeing their smiles and hearing how much they enjoyed my time there brightened my day filled me with purpose. Leaving to come back to school was very difficult for me and tears were shed on my final day. I am very grateful for the opportunity I had to serve residents of all different backgrounds and life stories and to this day, I think about them often."

This is important because every field of engineering, as well as every individual, deserves to be equally and fairly represented. All in all, having a voice and being able to represent your peers is what means the most to me.",
            "Question 9": "When I decided to work on my basketball shooting confidence, I didn't only measure success in terms of how many shots I made; I also measured success in terms of how comfortable I felt making those shots. I came to understand that self-belief and regular practice are the foundations of confidence. To achieve this plan, there would be no shortcuts. I tried to shoot more shots during games and in my own practice. I concentrated on my form and shot selection in addition to making shots. I also focused on the mechanics of my shot. I practiced release, follow-through, and good footwork. Drills helped me achieve my goal of a consistent motion.\nFinally, I concentrated on the mental side of shooting. I set out to focus on the next shot and maintain a positive attitude even after missing shots throughout the game. I was able to handle the pressure and not let a few shots rattle my confidence. As time went on, I realized that I was becoming more confident since I was shooting with greater ease and confidence. To succeed, I had to have faith in my hard work and confidence in my ability to perform to the best of my skills.",
            "Question 10": "I collaborated closely with another intern during my internship on a project to optimize a flow map for an assembly build of a plane. This flow map was crucial for streamlining the assembly process. Initially we both had different approaches to try and tackle the problem. My coworker gave top priority to making sure the map was easy for technicians to grasp, while I concentrated on enhancing the effectiveness of components and tool mobility throughout the floor. At first our different strategies caused some conflict, as we each believed our approach would have the biggest impact. Realizing that clarity and efficiency go hand in hand, we choose to integrate our methods. Furthermore, we consulted the technicians regularly to make sure our flow map took into account the difficulties they encountered on the floor. By working together, we created a flow map that shortened the assembly time and was easy for the technicians to use. I learned from this experience how important it is to combine different viewpoints and abilities in order to produce a more complete solution. It changed the way I saw teamwork, seeing it as an opportunity to combine our abilities to achieve more than we could separately.",
            "Question 11": "I tutored middle school students in an underprivileged neighborhood as a volunteer during the breaks between my freshman and sophomore years. Many of these students were having difficulty in many other courses, but especially in math. Realizing the importance of basic algebra for their success in all upcoming math subjects, I decided to organize weekly tutoring sessions. A number of students came up to me and complained about how hard some topics were and how they were afraid they would fall behind. In order to combat this, I used study rooms in the library and made a schedule to teach depending on students' availability. Each session focused on the most commonly challenging topics and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps.\nMany of the students who attended felt more confident in their talents and achieved higher exam results by the conclusion of the break. This experience helped me grow as a leader. It was rewarding to see my effort making a visible difference in these students' success. Tutoring taught me patience, empathy, and most importantly the value of giving back to the community."

            "Question 8": "One of the pillars from the SEC mission statement that I really gravitate towards, would be the engineering awareness pillar. This aspect of engineering really came into light for me when I was able to be a counselor for fish camp. What I did not realize, by talking to incoming engineering students, was that many of them did not know much about the different types of engineering, as well as the many opportunities there are both in college and in career choices. After learning this, I talked to the freshmen about different engineering clubs and academic opportunities, hoping that I could help them explore what engineering has to offer.\nIn today\u2019s world, I find that engineering awareness is vital for students pursuing engineering, due to the increasing amounts of different careers and fields. Therefore, I find it imperative to reach out to different aspiring engineers, and to be able to give them access to the many opportunities that engineering has to offer.",
            "Question 9": "When I was in 7th grade, I really enjoyed playing sports like football and lacrosse, and I really wanted to pursue my dream of playing lacrosse in college. However, during that year, I unfortunately had a knee condition that prevented me from running and playing sports for the rest of middle school. Although this setback really hurt my confidence and my dream, it shed light on a major goal that I still uphold to this day. I learned that even though I was not able to play sports at the time, there were still many opportunities for me to take advantage of. Realizing this, I went from being stumped by failure to excelling in academics, getting through physical therapy, and finding my strong passion for engineering.\nSeeing the success from my hard work and dedication throughout middle and high school, I wanted to make it my goal to not give up when met with failure or setbacks in the future. Instead, I want to always look for different opportunities to overcome any obstacles to not only find success for myself, but to be able to help others find success as well. As I have continued to progress through my college experience, I have been able to stay true to my goal and overcome different challenges. Whether it was challenges in group design projects, rejections in my freshmen year, or working with others to plan for events, I always dedicated myself to find solutions and ideas to overcome any obstacles.",
            "Question 10": "Throughout the COVID pandemic, I was able to get my first leadership role as a section leader in my band. Although I was just transitioning to a junior, I didn\u2019t realize the amount of weight that I was about to carry as a leader, especially once the pandemic hit. The pandemic was completely new to everybody, and the people around me began to struggle with many newer, complex problems that I have never experienced being around before. The reason that this experience had such a major impact on how I work with others, was because I had to learn how to be an adaptable and supportive group member, as well as a leader. I learned that when it came to problems with group practices, that listening to feedback from other group members was one of the most effective tools that I used during the season. Listening to others\u2019 concerns and ideas from the group allowed me to gain insight on different perspectives on a situation. This allowed me to try out different solutions that ended up being more helpful, than just coming up with a solution on my own. This experience from being a leader of a group during the pandemic showed me how important and effective it is to allow for feedback and communication within a group setting. These tools have allowed me to create a stronger group environment within any group that I am able to be a part of.",
            "Question 11": "In south Austin, I used to volunteer at a church where a group from my neighborhood would help clean and build projects. One of the most impactful service opportunities that I volunteered for, was for one of their food drives during the pandemic. During the drive, the church had more people than expected and were understaffed. When our group arrived, we were able to take the stress off of the church staff by helping them with their orders. Additionally, when I was loading people\u2019s cars with food, some of the people would thank us and share how much the food would help their families. Many of them stressed that the pandemic made it hard to get access to food, and that the food drive will relieve that stress off their families. This experience showed me that there are a lot of unshown hardships that people have to deal with. I learned that providing help, even a little amount, can make a difference on someone\u2019s life, which I really resonated with. With this, I make it my goal to try to help others when I can, because there is always an opportunity to make a positive impact on those around me."

Through attending the SEC\u2019s plethora of professional development opportunities, including last spring\u2019s HP Lunch and Learn and the SEC Career Fair, I have gained a strong foundation for the skills needed to be successful in my future career, including learning about networking tips and what software is most used in industry. At these events, I was able to directly network and interact with recruiters interested in hiring TAMU students specifically, a truly unique opportunity. Moreover, I am passionate specifically about Development because I am interested in becoming a Career Fair Coordinator. Having the opportunity to work on this large-scale project would allow me to leverage my planning skills and passion for the Development pillar into action by fostering the same opportunities that I benefited from. For instance, I would seek feedback from major specific students for what companies they would be interested in attending the Career Fair and reach out to those companies directly to ensure a greater spread in major attendance.",
            "Question 9": "In high school, I competed in a regional German competition where I worked in a team to build a non-traditional gingerbread house. To best utilize our efforts, my team delegated specific tasks to each team member; my focus was on finding a recipe that was structurally sound that could advance my team to state. Although a seemingly simple task, this duty was more difficult than I had initially anticipated due to my lack of baking expertise. I surfed the web tirelessly for a recipe that promised gingerbread that could withstand the weight of heavy candy. Finally, I discovered a recipe that promised to do all of the above and was highly rated by reviewers\u2014a perfect match. However, once I finally tested the recipe, I discovered that my creation was a complete miss, and the gingerbread completely crumbled under the weight of a couple of gumdrops. Though initially frustrated, I took this minor setback as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and went back to the baking process, this time reading more into how long to let gingerbread cool and specific techniques to reduce air bubbles within the batter. As a result, my later attempts were much improved from my first\u2014strong and reinforced. My success on this task was a result of my determination to not let failure define my efforts but rather to fuel my later attempts. Eventually, my team finished 4th at the state competition after placing 5th at the regional level.",
            "Question 10": "During my time in high school, I had the opportunity to serve as the Student Body President. In this position, one of the projects I planned was a campus-wide service event regarding the importance of mental health awareness. The idea for this project was to use a large cloth that would serve as a mural for our message, and to cut the cloth into small pieces that were distributed to 20+ clubs on campus for their personal interpretations for why mental health was important. Originally, I had anticipated that most of the cloth pieces would look similar, but I was pleasantly surprised and blown away by the true creativity of each piece of the mural. Some were art paintings, others were essays on the value of prioritizing mental well-being. Eventually, we sewed the pieces together and displayed them in the school hallway. From this service project, I truly understood the value of seeking unique opinions and input from multiple perspectives, as the diverse range of cloth pieces we received back were a testament to the power of partnering with other groups and utilizing each other's unique strengths and viewpoints. In addition, I discovered the paramount importance of collaborative teamwork. Through our individual efforts focusing on specific parts of the project, we were able to create a unique mural that truly represented different facets of the student body and each organization\u2019s unique perspectives.",
            "Question 11": "Last spring, I had the opportunity to participate in a service project with my Freshman Leadership Organization. For this project, we collected donations of emergency hygiene and household supplies such as shampoo, body wash, toothpaste and toothbrushes. Once we collected donations, we took a trip down to Houston where we created welcome kits and signs in different languages for the refugee community to see when they first got received at the airport. This opportunity taught me about how small acts of service can have large impacts, since by volunteering a little bit of my time on the weekend, I was able to make the transition to a new home for many refugees much more comfortable. This experience allowed me to give meaning to why I joined my FLO originally, having the opportunity to serve others with a global perspective to become more internationally minded and informed. Because of this experience, I have fostered my passion for service by actively partaking in volunteer groups on campus and returning to my FLO as a staff member to foster the same passion for service that I gained to our incoming freshmen."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that stands out to me the most is engineering awareness. As an incoming freshman, I had mentors in my scholarship, my engineering FLO, and engineering honors who all helped me navigate my first year of college as an engineer successfully. However, not everyone has these resources. Engineering is often viewed as one of the most difficult majors (rightfully so), but this makes a lot of incoming freshmen nervous they chose the wrong major or they won't be successful in something so challenging. SEC's EnVision Conference helps with this by creating a community of engineers from a young age. By giving younger students the chance to connect with current engineering students, it provides that all-important guidance early. And once the students are at A&M, SEC's E-week helps show all engineers that they have a place at A&M and they are appreciated. I want to use my membership in SEC to help make every engineer feel like they have a place at A&M.",
            "Question 9": "I set a goal for myself freshmen year to keep a perfect GPA so I could auto-etam in Mechanical Engineering. At first I defined success as just the number on my transcript, and first semester I achieved it. But surprisingly I didn't feel successful afterwards. I spent a lot of that semester procrastinating, barely scraped by in a class because my professor rounded up an 89.5, and felt like I was barely hanging on the whole year. Going into my spring semester I understood that if I kept up that low level of effort I wouldn't achieve my goal. So I changed how I viewed my success from the number on a transcript to how efficient I was with my time. I screen timed my phone, and made a point to use my free time better. I stayed on top of my classes, was less stressed, and achieved my goal again. However this time, I felt successful. I got out of that semester what I put in, and because I wasn't procrastinating I had more time to put towards my orgs and my friends. Through this experience I learned to judge success not by the outcome, but by the work I put towards the outcome. This semester I'm treating everything, from my grades to my job to hopefully SEC, the same way to get the most out of my time at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 10": "My Aggie SAT Lab design team freshman year helped me learn how to trust and rely on teammates. For all of my project groups freshmen year, I knew as much or more than everyone in the group, and was able to be a leader in every single one. But SAT lab was the opposite. The other three members of my subteam were two juniors and a grad student, all of which knew much more than me and were more experienced. At first it was overwhelming, and I had to work hard outside of the team to learn the necessary coding and electronics to understand enough to hold a conversation with them. I learned to ask questions when necessary and to just rely on my teammates when necessary. I learned to trust the critique from my team members, and to approach every piece of work with an open mind and humility. Through this, I was able to earn the trust of my teammates until I was able to complete pieces of the project on my own and contribute and equal share. It was humbling, but it taught me so much about a real team where other members will know more and listening is more important than talking. Coming into SEC I'll be a new member, and I'll have to learn from from more experienced SEC members. Because of my experience with SAT Lab, I'm prepared to tackle challenges together and work in a group.",
            "Question 11": "This summer I got to serve the class of 2028 as a fish camp counselor. From the beginning our chairs emphasized how important it was that our camp was freshmen focused. When we went to camp, I and the rest of the counselor's took our chairs' advice. I made a point to know my DG and cabin personally, and would walk up to and sit next to random freshmen just to get to know them. I'm normally terrible with names but I made a point to remember all of their names because I knew how much that would mean to them. And it paid off; the freshmen came to trust us as mentors in their life. As the engineering counselor, I got the chance to be the representative to over 30 incoming engineers who were curious about what their life would look like the next year and how they could make the most of it. They still reach out to me even now weeks after camp, and I'm glad to be the person who helped make their transition easier. After all of the support I've received from upperclassmen, it was gratifying to have an opportunity to give back to A&M."

This course offered a valuable opportunity to collaborate with various types of teammates, each bringing different strengths and challenges to the group dynamic. I encountered both positive and difficult group experiences each of which taught me important lessons about teamwork. In some groups, communication flowed easily, and accountability was upheld, leading to successful outcomes. In my group, one of my teammates went above and beyond and helped walk us through the parts we were confused about. Seeing someone go out of there way like this really stood out to me and encouraged me to start implementing it in all other teams I work in. However, other groups presented challenges such as teammates who were unresponsive or waited until the last minute to contribute. These experiences underscored the critical role that effective communication and accountability play in a team's success. Despite the difficulties, I came to appreciate the power of well-executed teamwork and its ability to drive outstanding results when everyone is aligned and committed.",

Throughout the event, I gained insightful knowledge and feedback about what professionals are looking for in my industry of Computer Science and how I can improve my application to become a more competitive candidate.\nI came into Texas A&M not having any prior knowledge as to how industry dynamics work and the events hosted by the SEC, including the Career Fair, have been crucial in helping me navigate the process. This support has not only clarified the steps I need to take but also motivated me to pursue excellence in my field and take advantage of the opportunities around me.\nOverall, SEC\u2019s commitment to professional development has been essential in helping me build a strong foundation for my career and has inspired me to take proactive steps towards my professional goals as I continue through my academic career and beyond into the professional world.",
            "Question 9": "One of the biggest ways I defined success in a goal that I set for myself was when I was coding my Library Management System (LMS). Throughout this process, I had one end goal which was the creation of a functional LMS but in between I set weekly deadlines for myself for each component of the project. For example, completing the login system early on in the project was a critical milestone that not only advanced the project but also boosted my confidence.\nEven now, I use a similar approach with my daily to-do lists that are my \u201cgoals\u201d which I review at the end of each day. This method of breaking down a large goal into manageable tasks helps me stay focused and organized. It helps me gauge my success regularly and allows me to adjust my approach as needed.\nMy method of defining success through multiple small goals that eventually lead to my ultimate bigger goal being accomplished is how I am able to stay consistent throughout my work.

Because of that, I decided to take lead on the project and proceeded to delegate tasks to each member of the group and made sure I found a time that worked with everyone where we could all meet in person. In the end, we successfully completed the project that met all the requirements.\nThroughout this experience, my perspective on working with others shifted. I learned that effective collaboration sometimes requires strong leadership to keep everyone on track and motivated. This experience taught me the importance of having a balance between collaboration and leadership to ensure a successful project.\nThis shift in perspective has influenced how I now approach group work. For example, in another group project for a different class, I applied these insights by taking on a leadership role early on in the project. This helped our team work more cohesively and achieve our goals more effectively.",

Over the ten weeks, I helped load five shipping containers that went to countries such as Ukraine, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Knowing that our dedication to our work here was helping hundreds of people thousands of miles away was deeply fulfilling.\nOne significant project I led involved packing respiratory kits that contained Laryngeal Mask Airways and Endotracheal Tubes along with many other essential supplies. Over several weeks, we assembled and shipped 1,000 bags to Benin. Reflecting on this experience, I realized that serving others is not about just completing tasks but also being able to connect with people, addressing their needs, and finally making a positive impact in their lives."

            "Question 9": "Success is defined differently per person. For me, it is not the amount \u201ccorrect\u201d. Rather, the amount I have taken in and learned through an opportunity. This summer, in my internship, I wanted to put my best foot forward. That was my goal, to perform my best and gain new skills wherever I can. Through the internship, I made progress on my project with bumps in the road. However, I also made sure to grasp as much knowledge as I could from the opportunity. I did so by asking for feedback from others to see how I can strive to do my best within the company. Beyond that, I ensured to learn more technical skills outside of my project scope to be able to talk to company leads in specific technical areas. Through my goal, I found success by making sure I took the most out of a learning opportunity, technically and non-technically. Within my project, when I faced issues in my code, I did not immediately go ask for help. I would try to research and solve it by myself and if that did not work, I would go ask my team. I found success in learning something new through the challenges I faced. Nontechnically, I ensured I met many people in the company in different technical areas.

            "Question 10": "Working with other people can always be a hit or miss. Having like-minded people can make things monotonous. While differing opinions can be valuable, they are hard to implement. Last year, my friend and I worked on a hackathon project which is now known as Maroon Rides, a bus app for A&M students. We decided to scale the project to fully implement a functional application after the hackathon. We took on new team members who could help us achieve our goals. However, as everyone was passionate about getting started, each member had differing opinions and paces about the project and the structure. Through this experience, I learned that strong communication and adaptability are important. In the beginning, as a team, we struggled as some team members would take charge of a feature while others may have been lost. This lack of communication and structure did not allow us to be efficient at the beginning. Through creating a project structure and team guidelines, we followed a structure of meeting once a week, having independent updates weekly, and demos each month. This allowed team members to not get lost in the group. This experience taught me that differing opinions are valuable to allow a project to grow but are not efficient without communication. Embracing a community and ensuring that each person is heard is important to allow for growth individually and collaboratively.",
            "Question 11": "Growing up, Metrocrest Family Services was where I would spend most of my weekends and summers. My family and I would go to the food bank every weekend and help people get food for the week, stock up the shelves, sort the donations, and etc. This taught me the value of food from a young age and is an experience that has shaped me into who I am today. This interest came into a passion project that I worked on a few years ago as well. I crafted and sold jewelry online and in my community and donated all profit to the North Texas Food bank. Currently, I try to volunteer at food banks around me to help those in and out of my community.\nBeyond these, I have served others in unconventional ways. Whether that is through spending extra time in office hours to ensure a student better understands a concept or helping a friend with a task. I hope to serve Texas A&M and the College of Engineering through SEC. The EnVision conference interests me as it would allow me to serve younger students and get exposed to new opportunities."

            "Question 8": "SEC\u2019s mission to increase engineering awareness aligns entirely with my passion in spreading STEM knowledge among youth. As a high school freshman, my friends and I founded STEM Siblings, a club that engages elementary students in STEM through monthly meetings, fascinating experiments, and guest speakers displaying real-world applications and career paths.\nOver the next few years, we spearheaded initiatives such as science fair mentorship (increasing participation by 30%), a STEM Night interactive event (engaging over 300 students districtwide), and field trips to NASA robotics facilities. Our biggest achievement was that students, regardless of their backgrounds, became interested in pursuing STEM pathways. I cannot describe how rewarding it is to see a young girl\u2019s face when she realizes she can solve a math problem, build a robot, or go into the STEM field.\nBy introducing real-world applications of STEM to young students of diverse backgrounds, we build a stronger generation of doctors, engineers, scientists, and people who can positively impact the world.",
            "Question 9": "My whole life, pursuing engineering has been a lifelong goal of mine. However, I often questioned whether I had the perseverance and grit to meet its demanding challenges.\nDuring high school, I was selected for a summer engineering design program. With pandemic constraints, we were forced to do many hands-on experiments at home. Our teacher announced that our final project would be a ballistic catapult system that shoots projectiles at different angles.\nAt first, I was lost and worried that the project was out of my league of experience. However, as I started researching ballistic catapult systems, ideas began to come to mind. After rummaging through my garage, I found some old pipes and an air compressor from our pool and began working. For the next several days, there were many iterations of paper drawings, design changes, and consultations with my teacher. There were interim happy moments when a subsystem worked and nights of desperation when the air compressor failed. Then finally, we were asked to demonstrate our ballistic mechanism. My project launched beautifully and excelled beyond simply completing the challenge. At that moment, I began believing in my capability to pursue an engineering career.\nMy ability to take an engineering problem from idea to implementation is what drives me to stay resilient in all of my professional pursuits.",
            "Question 10": "I strive to help others in my everyday life and in ways that will have a lasting impact. Through the creation of a STEM Siblings club at my high school, I was able to touch the lives of over 500 elementary students of diverse backgrounds. I continue to spread STEM knowledge as a CoderKids instructor, teaching children how to efficiently use technology.\nAs a CoderKids instructor, I ensure that I provide a creative and inspiring learning environment. I want all students to feel they have the capabilities to accomplish their ambitious engineering goals. When I feel a student is struggling with a lesson, I extend my help by separating them into a group so I can provide extra instruction. I was thrilled when they started staying late to ask questions and share their ideas.\nMy persistent motivation to serve others has undoubtedly improved my professional development. I am confident this will translate into my future goals as an engineer. As a prospective industrial engineer, I aspire to systematically solve problems to improve the efficiency of the ever-changing problems of society. I hope my efforts can reach the needs of others and provide comfort in our rapidly advancing technological world.\nI strongly believe that my background in spreading STEM knowledge among youth has contributed to my determination in being a voice for the next generation of engineers. This directly aligns with SEC\u2019s mission statement of increasing engineering awareness and I believe I can be an asset in continuing to achieve this.",
            "Question 11": "As a freshman, I quickly realized how grateful I was for my Fish Camp experience, my discussion group parents and the friends I made during my time at fish camp. It was a relief to know I did not have to worry about who to attend the first game with, who to sit with at the MSC, or finding someone to walk to class with.\nThis inspired me to become a Fish Camp counselor and make the incoming class of 2028 feel the same way I did. By fostering an inviting and uplifting environment through fun activities, silly skits, and discussion time, the freshmen were able to open up. This allowed them to feel comfortable around both the counselors and the other freshmen at camp.\nNow, I strive to continue being a support system for my freshmen by hosting weekly group hangouts like pickleball, MSC lunches, Midnight Yell, and other fun activities they enjoy.\nThis passion for serving the freshmen class and fostering a welcoming atmosphere, directly aligns with SEC\u2019s Special Events Committee. Their goal of supporting the new engineering students at Texas A&M mirrors my commitment to ensuring every student is confident in taking on their college journey."

Trying to fathom how I would achieve an internship with absolutely zero experience, now competing with other students who had some, was daunting and mentally taxing. However, with the help of the SEC Career Fair, I was able to secure my first internship following sophomore year, which then turned into a return internship following the next year. Because of my personal experience, the pursuit of the professional advancement of all engineering students means the most to me. Forever grateful, I now hope to pay it forward, providing students who, like I was, are discouraged and overwhelmed, with the best possible opportunities to kick start their early career.",
            "Question 9": "I view short-term goals as specific, often serving a single purpose, while I view long-term goals as large milestones with a theme. As such, I think success is defined differently for short-term goals versus long-term goals. For short-term goals, I take a results-oriented approach for defining success. Did I achieve the goal? These goals are short yet targeted, so it is important that they are completed. How accurate was my timeline? Achieving the goal well before or well after the deadline suggests the goal was too easy or too hard. A goal that\u2019s too easy is not challenging enough to learn something new while a goal that\u2019s too hard is too challenging to take away something of value; neither is successful. For long-term goals, I take a more journey-oriented approach. What did I learn that I will continue to use outside of this goal? These skills make you adaptable, leading to success in more than just this goal. Did I make progress on a consistent basis? These goals are marathons, not sprints; they should be treated as such. Procrastinating and achieving the goal at the end indicates it wasn\u2019t a long-term goal. This is a failure in planning. Lastly, how did I adapt during the journey? Long-term goals are seldom achieved in a straight line. Overcoming obstacles and redefining plans is necessary for successfully avoiding setbacks.",
            "Question 10": "A group member plagiarized roughly 80-90% of an abstract for a lab report using the example from the TAs. When questioned by myself and our other group member, he nonchalantly responded that \u201cthere are only so many ways to write an abstract, so it\u2019s okay.\u201d We quickly questioned this claim, and in the middle of the lab, an argument broke out such that the rest of the class fell silent. My other group member and I collectively decided we didn\u2019t trust our third member, and elected to take on more work so there was less plagiarism. While it did make an impact, there was tension for the whole semester. This experience shaped my perspective on the importance of handling disagreements, no matter how small, emphasizing the significance of the group dynamic, and just how quickly it can change. Had we resolved the issue through mature discussions rather than childish arguments, the group dynamic may have been salvaged. Today, I make it a top priority to ensure a situation does not escalate, regardless of how strongly I believe in my position. I focus on trying to understand why we disagree, so that we can find a solution together, ensuring the group dynamics are maintained.",
            "Question 11": "While a long time ago, the most memorable, because of how close it was, service for me is Lovepacs. Lovepacs was born when the founding families became aware of 6 kids at Camey Elementary in The Colony, Texas who were being sent home from school every Friday with a backpack of food because they were not getting enough to eat on the weekend. After talking with the school counselor, they found that many of these kids would go hungry over the Thanksgiving holiday when they were out of school for a week. At the time of this discovery, I was a student at Camey Elementary. The thought of kids not eating is enough to make anyone flinch, but the emotion is heightened when those kids are the same ones you see at school. My community was able to provide not just 6, but 46 boxes of food - each feeding one child 2 meals and a snack each day for the 9-day break. Being part of the reason kids at your own school get to eat is an irreplaceable experience that teaches the importance of community and service, and I am forever grateful that I was a part of it."

            "Question 8": "Out of the three pillars, the one that means the most to me is development. This semester, I have really been trying to step out of my comfort zone and get involved with engineering outside of the classroom. Because of this, I am really drawn to the SEC\u2019s focus on development and its effect on all of the engineers at A&M. Personally, I think it would be very rewarding to work on one of the councils that directly impacts and benefits us as engineers. For instance, I just recently learned that the SEC sets up and runs Industry Nights. I really liked Industry Night as it gave us some early exposure to professional company events. I feel that it would be rewarding to work on the Engineering Development council because I know that I would be helping engineers with their development. The Career Fair has been many students\u2019 best tool for professional development such as myself, which is another reason why I most value the SEC\u2019s development pillar. Just these two events have had a big impact on me and being able to help provide these resources for other engineers like myself would be rewarding.",
            "Question 9": "Starting from the 8th grade through high school, I played the French Horn and found a deep passion for music. For the first three years of high school, I tried out for the All-Region Band, and placed well each year. I was Horn player at my school to make Region and so my senior year, I decided to set the goal of inspiring my section by making All State Band. After practicing every day for months, eager to prove to myself that I could make my goal, I tried out and advanced to the final audition for state. After the audition, I missed state by a few chairs, and was convinced that I had failed my goal. It was only until one of the freshmen in my section came up to me after and told me that I inspired him to push for region, that I realized I was wrong. He saw that I put all my effort into it and he wanted to do the same. I realized that though I didn\u2019t make State, I still succeeded in my goal by inspiring some of my peers and changing their mindset on playing the French Horn. Since then, my perspective on the goals I set has changed as I\u2019ve realized that I can succeed in many different ways. Going forward, I make sure to approach goals with an open mindset and realize that the path to success is never completely clear, yet always there.",
            "Question 10": "While volunteering for an organization called Awesome Fridays, we were assigned one special needs person to take care of while the parents got a night to themselves. Although I had experience with special needs people, I quickly found that it was very difficult to take care of the man, and in just a short amount of time I was exhausted, confused, and admittedly a little frustrated. One of the other volunteers noticed that I was struggling and came to work with me. She had a lot of personal and volunteer experience with special needs people, and I was exposed to her different perspective, allowing me to better tend to the man. Working with her, I was able to approach taking care of the man in a new light and it significantly helped me overcome problems. That night, I truly learned the impact that others can have when working to get something done. She helped me realize the importance of working with others with different experiences because it has a huge impact on solving problems. I\u2019ve come to see that it\u2019s easy to work solo or with like minded people, but it\u2019s not always the best choice; differences are what make people special and provide new insight. Now, I know the importance of working with different backgrounds and getting exposure to unique insights as it makes a big difference when focusing on a goal.",
            "Question 11": "Through the Young Men\u2019s Service League, I volunteered several times for an organization called Streetside Showers which provides clean, safe showers through a portable truck, and provides needed food, clothing, and toiletries. While volunteering, I cleaned the showers, and provided clothing, toiletries, and food to the people. It was always sad to see struggling people from my community, but it was rewarding to be able to help them in the small ways I could. From volunteering, I learned the importance of giving back to the community and how much we take everyday things for granted. Seeing kids my age needing the resources of Streetside Showers emphasized my goal of treating everyone fairly as you never know what their day to day conditions and story are. Organizations like Streetside Showers help me realize how important serving others is and how a little effort goes a long way, especially when helping people with nothing else to lose. This year and going forward at A&M, I am trying to get more involved with serving the community, as I realize that I am in a privileged position to be going to a great college and studying engineering."

            "Question 8": "Going to the career fair freshman year and being able to talk to these companies while gaining opportunities helped me tremendously in becoming a better engineer. This is why the pillar that resonates with me is fostering professional advancement. The development division is important for several reasons. First, career preparation through events like career fairs gives students like me a chance to meet potential employers and find internships or jobs. Doing this benefits students so much as they not only get ready to join the real world of engineering but also allows them to be great candidates once they do. Also, different types of workshops, guest speaker speeches, and networking events helped me build confidence as well as improve my technical skills. I feel like this pillar goes hand in hand with the Aggie Network as they both link these promising students to a wide variety of industry professionals to help guide them to success. For me, the pillar of professional advancement is not just about helping students find academic opportunities, but rather shaping them into promising candidates in the real world to help guide them towards their professional dreams.",
            "Question 9": "My definition of success has changed as I have grown. First, I used to consider a project successful by simply reaching the end goal. For example, when I was given the task of creating an engineering assignment in my junior year of high school, my mind was set on just completing the task at hand before the deadline. If this was accomplished, I would associate the project with success, just like that. However, as I entered college, my viewpoint on success completely shifted. Instead of defining success by the final product, I now associate it with the process I took as well as the impact that it has. For instance, this past summer, a couple of my friends and I wanted to develop an application as a professional project. My goal for this project was to learn and collaborate cohesively while completing the final result. Once all of these criteria were met, only then did I think of it as a success. Success for me dives deeper into the connection with the task, in which the quality of work I put in, the learning experiences gained, and the overall contribution to the community are all crucial factors. Ultimately, success has become more than just completing a task for me. It\u2019s about the journey, the growth, and the impact that comes along with it.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others occurred during a collaborative project in my senior year of high school. Our task was thought to be simple: you have one entire school year to create a product of your choice. Engineering Design and Development was the name of this class in which 4 students got together in order to create a functioning prototype by the end of the year. I very quickly realized that this would be much more challenging than I would\u2019ve thought. With each group member bringing diverse skills and viewpoints, our group soon dealt with a variety of challenges. We had different opinions on the type of project to make, our communication was sporadic, and stress was at an all-time high. I realized that we had to work well as a team in order to be successful, rather than individually doing whatever we could. I learned that it is better to first listen and understand the viewpoints of each team member. Once we did this, it became very easy to bring our ideas together to tackle the task at hand.  Clear communication was another one of the most important aspects of getting a team to properly collaborate. Setting expectations to prevent misunderstandings helped us create a more organized environment. Finally, I realized that collaboration is also about building trust and recognizing each other's strengths. Doing so could even transform a group of strangers into an amazing team.",
            "Question 11": "During winter break of 2023, I had a great time being a volunteer to serve and assist teachers/students during a State Farm STEM program for young children. This experience consisted of helping elementary school students get introduced to STEM. My role involved leading some small workshops on different topics related to STEM. This 3-day long workshop included setting up interactive academic games to encourage fun while learning among students. Quickly after the first day, I realized that serving these students was much more than just teaching them about academics. On the second day of the workshop, while teaching math, a young student struggled to grasp some of the concepts that I was teaching. I then began to spend extra time with him, trying to teach him different ways so that he could understand. While doing so I saw the impact of patience and personalized attention. I began to see his eyes sparkle with understanding and his confidence grew as well throughout the next few days. Through this experience, I realized that serving others needs commitment, empathy, and flexibility to make a difference. This perspective has influenced how I approach service and will continue to do so."

            "Question 8": "The most important pillar from the SEC Mission Statement is \u201cengineering awareness\u201d as this focus on educating the public is crucial to expose the next generation to STEM. By promoting earlier education in STEM, the SEC helps young minds improve their ability to solve complex problems in the future. This was pivotal for me personally, as I initially had minimal knowledge and interest when it came to the engineering field. It wasn\u2019t until my 8th grade, where I took a class that required woodworking to solve fairly straightforward problems, that I realized my passion for problem solving and engineering. One of my favorite projects during that class was creating a miniature car out of wood and wheels and competing to see how far it could travel. That hands-on experience sparked my interest in engineering, as it showed me the practical side of problem-solving and the creativity involved. This personal connection to STEM makes the SEC's emphasis on engineering awareness especially meaningful to me, as I believe early exposure to these fields can inspire others the same way it did for me.",
            "Question 9": "For me, success is defined not solely by the outcome but by the personal growth and improvement gained along the way. While reaching a goal is certainly important, I believe the obstacles faced and lessons learned during the process are significantly more indicative of success. An example of this was when I was an intern for the social officers in the Vietnamese Student Association at Texas A&M last year. At the beginning of the year, I had set a goal to join a group where I could invest my time and effort, as I prefer to devote time into nurturing a space where I feel comfortable and helpful. I had joined the VSA Intern team as a way to enable this, planning several events for hundreds of people such as VSA Week in spring semester and the Lunar New Year event where over 700 people had come.\nOne event that stood out to me was the End of Year Banquet, where me and the other interns had to start planning for nearly 5 months prior, with difficulties finding a location to book and managing the funds to make the event happen. Through this experience, I\u2019ve grown comfortable with thinking flexibly while working with others and depending on them instead of tackling everything on my own. By the time the banquet arrived, we had organized multiple food drives to fund the event, resulting in an event that was said to be better than those of previous years.",
            "Question 10": "Back in high school, I volunteered regularly at the Texas School for the Deaf summer program called the Communication Skills Workshop with minimal signing ability. I primarily worked behind the scenes with preparations and menial tasks, working with the faculty for the majority of the time. Through this experience, I was able to understand the importance of making yourself useful regardless of ability or skill. I wanted to help the program work but without any ESL knowledge, I struggled with communicating with the students and couldn\u2019t help them directly. Instead, I focused heavily on alleviating any form of stress from the small team of faculty members that decided to stay over the summer by doing any sort of tasks possible such as moving around boxes to folding clothes and organizing merchandise. This made me realize that it isn\u2019t necessarily important to always be the person leading when it comes to working with others, and that it\u2019s perfectly fine to depend on others for guidance. Every person has a different skill set and can be proficient at very different things. The effectiveness of a team lies in enabling these diverse skills and placing people in an environment where they feel as though they can contribute most effectively. By focusing on contributing to the CSW in ways that my abilities allowed me to, I gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to work with others.",
            "Question 11": "During my time as a barista at Sharetea, I had the opportunity to serve others in a meaningful way in both professional and personal settings. There were several times where people would require someone to pick up their shift at the last minute due to personal emergencies and it would be difficult to find someone willing to substitute them. Since the shifts include only 2-3 people, missing a person would affect the work speed significantly. One specific case was when my coworker at the time had an essay that they needed to finish by the end of the day. Instead of letting them stress about it, I decided that I could handle the evening portion of the shift by myself while they worked on it in the seating area. This led me to take every order and every drink by myself over the course of 2 hours. This experience, although grueling at the moment, enabled me to elevate my coworker relationship to a friendship. While stressful, I believe it to be important to cover for friends when they need it as it will more often than not, show to be fruitful in the long-term."

            "Question 9": "To define success in a goal, I believe it\u2019s crucial to focus on the journey of working towards it and making consistent progress. My goal was to build a routine and stay organized to set and achieve other objectives. Success wasn\u2019t just about reaching a final milestone; it was about how I approached each day with intention and structure.\nDuring COVID, when my life lacked structure, I set a small yet meaningful goal for myself: to ride my bike every day. This simple routine provided a sense of purpose, each ride became more than just exercise\u2014it was a chance to clear my mind, enjoy the outdoors, and establish a daily rhythm. Achieving this goal daily gave me a sense of accomplishment and helped me create a new routine. This experience taught me the value of setting manageable goals and the impact they can have on maintaining both physical and mental well-being.\nThis success in maintaining my bike routine laid the foundation for setting and achieving more significant goals.

This experience taught me that consistent, manageable goals can lead to broader achievements and help create a more balanced and fulfilling life.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was when I worked at a juice and smoothie bar and had the chance to promote our products at a Skeeters game. I decided to bring along two coworkers to help, excited to put my meticulous planning skills to use. I had carefully mapped out every detail: how to transport the goods, set up the table, and advertise our products effectively. However, I struggled to communicate my plans clearly to my more relaxed colleagues, who preferred a less structured approach.\nAs we set up and started engaging with customers, I saw my colleagues spontaneously come up with creative ideas to attract attention, like interactive games and promotions, that I hadn\u2019t anticipated. Initially, I was hesitant, worried that deviating from my plan might jeopardize our success. But as we embraced their suggestions, it became clear that their ideas were not only innovative but also highly effective in drawing in more customers and creating a lively atmosphere.\nThis experience taught me the immense value of being open-minded. I realized that while careful planning is important, being flexible and receptive to others\u2019 perspectives can lead to better outcomes and foster a more dynamic team environment. It was a powerful lesson in balancing structure with creativity and highlighted that successful teamwork thrives on listening to and valuing diverse viewpoints. This has deeply influenced how I approach collaboration, making me more appreciative of different working styles and more open to innovative solutions.",
            "Question 11": "A memorable time when I served others was at an overnight religious camp where I started by handing out plates, napkins, and food to the campers. However, my role extended far beyond that. I volunteered for a week during the summer with 9th and 10th graders, taking on the responsibility of being a role model. My duties included teaching them about religion, befriending them, and helping them feel at home. From unpacking their belongings and setting up their bunks to sharing meals and playing games, I was there every step of the way. By the end of the week, as we packed up and prepared to go home, I realized that true service involves much more than just fulfilling tasks\u2014it\u2019s about building relationships and making a positive impact on the lives of others.headed home, I saw that true service is about being present, offering support, and making a positive impact on others' lives."

This experience reinforced how vital it is to communicate effectively and get along with team members as it is impossible for the product to be successfully made without collaboration.\nI was also in a team with 4 other members and we would go through the process of the product being made start to finish. During this we would talk to each team while also thinking of ways we can maximize efficiency. Working with this team also shaped my perspective as each member had different ideas to maximize efficiency and each individual input was innovative and unique. Overall, this internship demonstrated how much team work is necessary in the work force and how it can make or break a company.",
            "Question 11": "For many years, I have competed in spelling bees and have continued to tutor and mentor children aiming to compete at the national level, just as I did. However, one year, the Austin regional sponsor was unable to send a participant to the National Spelling Bee due to financial constraints. Me and my family have participated in the spelling bee for years and it was disheartening to know that many kids who put in the same time and hard work that I did would not be able to move on to the next level.\nUpon learning this, I met with the sponsor and proposed various fundraising ideas such as orientations or price matches. Over the next few months, I reached out to other sponsors, reached out to previous spellers and winners to help organize orientations, and arranged price-matching efforts. Ultimately, we raised enough money to send two participants to nationals instead of just one. This was a great experience as I had an impact on the community and allowed other competitors to advance to the next levels and share the same valuable experiences that I did."

            "Question 9": "Over this past summer I had the wonderful privilege to do a research internship abroad in Brazil. While on this internship, I was given the goal of writing a literature review about the intricacies of flight simulators, their purposes, and future uses. At first, I underestimated the task. I thought it was a simple technical paper about flight simulators that would show what I had learned on my internship, and this paper would only be read by my professor and my A&M sponsors. To accomplish this, I found some basic sources and crafted a lengthy technical, but rather admittedly shallow paper, and after about 3 weeks of working on the paper, I handed it to my professor for review. He quickly informed me that I had misunderstood him. This paper was not for him, nor A&M: it was to be published in a professional journal and cited for years to come. I spent the next two weeks redefining the paper and what success meant. I reread my sources, found new ones, and searched for any guides on how to make the paper more professional. While I had invested effort before to make the paper appear nice, I was now pouring effort into making it the best it could possibly be. By defining and redefining my goals and what it meant to succeed, I was able to produce a literature review that I am extremely proud of, and gained technical abilities that will serve me well in the future.",
            "Question 10": "As a part of my internship in Brazil mentioned earlier, I participated in a Boot Camp for Autonomous Flight. This bootcamp featured students from three universities and different continents: USP - S\u00e3o Carlos, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Texas A&M, and from those universities, a total 12 students with 8 different nationalities were tasked with building a small experimental airplane. Our first order of business was setting a definite objective of what we wanted to accomplish. Here, a Swedish student named Isaac asserted himself into the proceeds and made several key decisions for the project. He realized that while many of these early design decisions would be changed, we had to make choices to get the project moving. We all then split into three groups to take care of individual tasks, and had to trust each other in getting these tasks done. I was put on the stability team, where we began to fall behind as our test became overly complicated. Here, I recognized the time we were spending on this small part of the project was delaying other critical objectives, and I made the decision to split the group so that we could finish our task and start other urgent ones. From working with Isaac and the other students I learned that a leader is not the strongest or smartest person in the room; they are the person who is willing to make tough decisions and be held responsible for them.",
            "Question 11": "Last year, I participated in The Big Event as a staff assistant. I had initially wanted to be involved with TBE because I had enjoyed being a volunteer the year prior, and figured it was a good way to get involved. However, what I got in return was much more than I expected. My responsibilities were to go out to residents houses and examine what they needed to be done on the day of the Big Event, and then make estimates on how many tools and students were needed. Whenever I would go to meet these residents, they were overjoyed to talk with me, telling me about their previous experiences with TBE, showing me their house, and it was touching seeing how deeply this service event affected them. The majority of the residents were elderly people who needed help with tasks that they couldn\u2019t do anymore, and to see how truly grateful they were to have young students take the time out of their day to help them was endearing. I truly got to understand what it meant to serve others through this experience, and how small acts of service can impact people for a long time."

I came into Texas A&M University with low self-confidence and avoided talking to new people because it was uncomfortable. I have since flourished both professionally and interpersonally with the SEC\u2019s help. One of these impactful moments for me was the SEC career fairs and the events leading up to them. I remember wanting to go my freshman year but felt overwhelmed and decided I would go the next year. I held myself to it, and this time seeked help with advancing my resume, elevator pitch, and conversational skills. I found help with all of these through the SEC. Once it came time for the career fair, it was as if I hit a reset button at first. I was back to being awkward when it came time to talk with recruiters, but I stuck it out and stayed the full day.

            "Question 9": "When I was a freshman, I knew I wanted to major in computer engineering. I set that as my goal and told myself I would define success as getting a 4.0 GPA so I could guarantee auto-admission. While this was a high goal to reach, I purposely set it high for myself. I am a believer in shooting for the moon and if I miss, I will land among the stars. Setting goals that are attainable and difficult are the best keys to success for me. I have had times in my life where I didn\u2019t reach the goal that I set and life always moves on. In the earlier example, I did not get a 4.0 freshman year. But because I put in the effort I believed was capable of getting a 4.0, I was close and still within auto-admission, so I still achieved my goal of majoring in computer engineering. Although I didn\u2019t reach my overarching goal, I would not say that I didn\u2019t succeed in this scenario. Success is expectations and is fluid and ever changing. Even if I hadn\u2019t reached my major, I would have needed self compassion but I would have moved on. Another idea I take on is failing fast and fixing it. When I do fail, I give myself self compassion and allow my goals to realign so I can reach a new definition of success. This is what keeps me motivated and pushes me forward.",
            "Question 10": "As a tutor at the Math Learning Center, I have had many opportunities to work with students from different backgrounds, perspectives, and most importantly, learning styles. Tutoring is a very outward facing role, so it requires understanding the students\u2019 perspective in order to be most effective. As someone with a passion for electricity and electronics, I often find that to be what I use to relate math concepts to the real world for myself. Unfortunately during my first semester of tutoring, I quickly found out that not everyone shares that passion or has even taken physics to understand math in the same way I do. A strategy I quickly took, was getting to know students\u2019 majors or passions in general, and relating math to something familiar to them. For example, I tutored a geology major who needed help understanding the purpose of triple integrals. When I learned it, I related the concept to the accumulation of charge. For this student, I instead related it to accumulating density of rock, and quickly the visual made the topic much more digestible for her. This experience, along with many others from tutoring, have highlighted the importance of empathy and putting myself in others\u2019 shoes in order to communicate more effectively, and most importantly, make a larger impact in a team.",
            "Question 11": "Tutoring at the Math Learning Center has given me many opportunities to serve beyond expectations. Of course, I get paid to tutor, but often I end up building relationships with these students. Most of the students I tutor are freshmen engineers and want guidance through ETAM and how to get involved with the university, so I aim to provide a space where I am open to questions other than tutoring. I was happy to check students\u2019 ETAM essays, student org essays, and give future career advice as an older student. My goal was to turn the space into a comfortable area where it feels like they are asking a friend for advice. I value connections like this, and I know I would have appreciated a space to ask for advice freely and in comfort when I was a freshman. I take this value for connections in anything I do. I value peoples\u2019 stories and believe everyone deserves to be heard. Even if it is beyond the context of what I am doing, I always aim to help and comfort people in this way."

However, I also found that many students are unaware of the full range of programs available.\nWhile there are well-known events like DI Saturday and Industry Night that help first-year students choose their engineering disciplines wisely, I found that there are also programs like Zachry Leadership Program and Aggies in Tech that provide engineering students with valuable experiences beyond just problem-solving skills. When discussing these programs with friends, I found that many were either unaware of them or hesitant to apply due to a lack of information. I personally learned about these through conversations with upperclassmen.\nI believe Zachry offers invaluable opportunities for personal and professional growth, but the challenge lies in ensuring that all students are aware of and take advantage of these opportunities. If given the chance to join the SEC, I aim to support Zachry by gathering feedback and data to enhance awareness and engagement through participating in legislation or marketing committees.",
            "Question 9": "I define my success in the past as my process of growth. During my high school AP Chemistry class, there was a board where the names of students who earned perfect test scores were written. As an immigrant student striving for academic success, getting my name on that board became one of my biggest goals for the year, but despite my best efforts, I faced countless failures\u2014even when I felt most confident. I was struggling to understand why I kept making mistakes or why there were always one or two questions I couldn\u2019t answer. With help from my friend, who consistently made it onto the board, I realized that I wasn\u2019t effectively identifying key points during lectures or properly assessing my understanding of the material.\nTo improve, I compared my notes with hers and asked myself after each class what the key points were. I eventually developed my own strategy for note-taking, self-checking, and studying. By the end of the year, I made it onto the board several times, earned an A+, and scored a 4 on the AP exam.\nWhile achieving this success felt significant, it felt more like the start of my discipline journey. The process to my success allowed me to develop the foundation for my learning strategy and taught me the value of understanding why I fail and improving from it. This experience taught me that success is not just an achievement, but also a proof that I have learned how to grow from failure.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was participating in a hackathon during my second semester as a freshman. My team, consisting of three freshmen, including myself, had no prior software development experience. However, we were all eager to learn and grow, filled with excitement to turn our ideas into reality and make positive impacts. Our project was to develop a restaurant-finding website to help users discover the best restaurants in College Station based on their food preferences and Google Maps reviews.\nTo maximize the experience, we tried to implement every aspect of our ideas, but our lack of experience led to challenges like debugging and handling user interactions. Yet, it was through these obstacles that I gained valuable insights from the diverse perspectives of my teammates on viewing challenges. For instance, when we struggled to connect two website pages, I approached the problem methodically by breaking it down into smaller parts. Meanwhile, my teammate took a creative approach, experimenting with new solutions. This difference in perspective sparked more communication within the team, allowing us to share ideas, which allowed us to stay motivated and dedicated to completing our development successfully.\nAlthough we didn\u2019t achieve the expected quality due to time constraints, we learned how valuable results communication can bring in a team environment. This experience showed me that working with others is not just about completing a task but an opportunity to gain new perspectives and positively influence one another.",
            "Question 11": "One of the most memorable times I served others was when I volunteered at an event for children with Down syndrome. About 100 children participated, supported by 50 volunteers, and each volunteer was assigned to two children. Initially, I signed up because a friend suggested it. However, this experience completely redefined what service means to me.\nAt first, the children were afraid and hesitant to engage in activities like crafting and dancing. My job was to help them feel safe and comfortable, so I tried to create an environment where they could relax. As I participated with them, I found myself genuinely enjoying the activities, which seemed to make the children more at ease. It seemed that my engagement and presence allowed them to feel relaxed, and by the end of the day, they were not just participating but fully embracing the joy of the event, without fear or hesitation.\nWitnessing this transformation was incredibly fulfilling. Seeing their smiles and knowing that my time and presence contributed to their happiness left me with an unexplainable joy. This experience taught me that service isn\u2019t just about giving and helping others\u2014it\u2019s about sharing moments of connection and making a positive impact."

Providing early opportunities for students to connect their majors into the roles and fields they want to join after graduation helps them become passionate and impactful engineers. Personally, the SEC helped me learn so much about the tech industry and semiconductor companies that align with my career goals. Specifically, the opportunity to meet with engineers from Texas Instruments during the Career Fair Welcome Chat, two years in a row, helped me learn the specific technical areas computer engineers work on and the best choices to make to prepare for the unique responsibilities for each role. This had a huge influence in helping me envision and plan the roles that I want to have and develop the skills that can set me apart. The profound impact of SEC in shaping and helping me navigate my professional journey, makes me truly excited to join SEC and be able to create the same impact for future engineers. The professional advancement pillar helps distinguish Aggie Engineers and I want to be part of it helping them make the right decisions for their careers early on.",
            "Question 9": "During junior year of HS, I was assigned to lead the implementation of sensors in the robot and utilizing them innovatively to give us a chance at qualifying to Worlds. In previous seasons, we did not step out of our comfort zone which reflected in our performance, so success for this goal was to change that trend. The catch was no one in our team worked with sensors before, including me. While I started off trying to learn about sensors from the online documentation and videos and then teaching my team about it, that soon turned out exhausting with little progress. So I decided to change the way the team learnt about it. I contacted our sponsors and previous mentors and pitched our ideas for the sensors and the impact their contribution can have to the team. To make the mentor workshops even more successful, I invited a neighboring robotics team to the sessions, who pitched in some old sensors for us to practice on, to have collaborative sessions to learn new things and play around with different ideas. Our team not only qualified to Worlds, but also made it to the top 5 in the State match. This goal specifically is close to my heart because it was also a personal success, where I was able to start from scratch and build something great. I was able to identify when I wasn\u2019t progressing and needed help and was able to successfully collaborate and communicate to find successful solutions.",
            "Question 10": "For the final engineering design course of high school, I was supposed to work with a group of 3 to work on a year-long final engineering project. A suggestion I saw in a self-help book prompted me to suggest that before we even started brainstorming, we should list our strengths and weaknesses. This set a solid ground for the entire project with each member being active as they were assigned roles that they enjoyed. This also helped us identify strengths that balance other\u2019s weaknesses. An example of this was when I helped use my programming background to help another member code and debug their Arduino code, while she taught me how to 3D print my prototypes for testing. By communicating our strengths, we knew which member is most efficient in helping solve a problem, greatly increasing our cooperation and efficiency. This project experience helped me recognize that to be an effective team player, it is not enough to just do your best but also helping others put their best foot forward, so the team can be successful. I brought this same energy to my ENGR 102 team, where I helped out group members with some more complex topics like function scope and ensured everyone felt included by helping them finish their lab portion instead of just doing it myself. Considering the collaborative nature of the SEC, I want to bring these skills and experiences to help any group I am part of successfully execute SEC\u2019s mission.",
            "Question 11": "After a year of being an active member of Westwood HS\u2019s Outreach club I noticed that the impact of its current activities was very limited and wasn\u2019t very impactful in giving back to the community. So when I became its Vice-President, I seized the opportunity to improve the club. I coordinated numerous events, collaborating with non-profits in and around Austin, and local businesses partnering with our club to support our fundraising. One of the biggest was creating 1000 snack packs for a foundation that provides essentials to homeless people, from funds collected by organizing a fall festival. I also hosted an in-person Thanksgiving social where we created dog toys out of old clothes and handcrafted 200 birthday and well-wishing cards for hospitalized children throughout the year. But my service isn't limited to the community. As VP, I initiated underclassmen help sessions where upperclassmen taking APs tutored underclassmen in the corresponding pre-AP thus helping create a strong sense of bond between current and new members, which increased membership and retention. I also kept our 150 members informed and motivated through regular meetings, updates, and end-of-semester celebrations and parties, which was reflected in the effort we put into all our volunteering."

Enthusiasm will be a driving force in my contributions to the Engineering Development Committee, through events like DI Saturday and Industry Nights. These initiatives are crucial for providing students with exposure to networking opportunities and are what drew me to this Committee.\nI believe I am the right candidate for this division due to several developmental experiences. I have been a Hullabaloo U Peer Mentor for two years and guide 30 freshmen transitioning into college. Academically and logistically, I impact 65 cadets as a scholastics/finance sergeant. I head the International Student Association for this school year. I hold everyone in ISA accountable for meeting our goal of making the A&M campus welcoming to international students. I want to continue supporting engineering students, help them find their path, and encourage their professional development.\nAggie Engineers have the potential to be the most skilled/competent professionals in the engineering field.

            "Question 9": "When I joined the Corps initially, I faced a significant challenge: my physical fitness was not at its peak, a concern that likely motivated my father to enrol me. Initially, I struggled with the high demands of physical training and failed the mock Physical Fitness Test (PFT). Thankfully, for me, this was just a trial and I had time before the actual exam.\nIn the ensuing months, I committed myself wholeheartedly to improving my physical condition. This involved frequent gym visits, running 10 miles weekly, and balancing these efforts with academic responsibilities and other Corps activities.\nMy determination extended to joining the Fish Drill Team (FDT), a prestigious and challenging commitment for any freshman in the Corps. This required returning early from winter break to engage in nine hours of daily military drill practice. Looking back on it, I had some rough times but I am fairly confident it was the best decision of my life. One thing that helped me and kept me in was the support of my buddies in the Corps around me. They believed in me more than I did. I came out of FDT as a much stronger human being and finally passed the PFT in spring to cement my place in the Corps.",
            "Question 10": "Selfless Service/Community Service has been an integral part of my life. After coming to A&M and joining ISA, I used to help International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) distribute free food as a volunteer. While volunteering, I found a PhD student whose funding for her horticulture program had been revoked and she would be unable to continue her services because of it. This experience made me realize the challenges many students face outside the classroom.\nAfter talking to her more, I was exposed to the financial hardships that some students go through. I connected her with my organization in hopes of finding resources/networks that could help her. Over the next few months, she was able to secure funding for a program at Galveston, allowing her to continue her journey. This highlighted the importance of community support and the existence of \"Aggie Family\" for me.\nLike SEC, my life has three pillars in the form of communities: the Corps, ISA and Engineering. These groups have given me guidance and support whenever I needed them. Now, I feel like it's my turn to give back to the engineering community by helping them in the same way I help people in the Corps and ISA. I want to continue to embody myself in one of Aggieland's most important Core values while working with SEC in the future.",
            "Question 11": "One of the most fulfilling experiences in my journey as a cadet is serving as the First Sergeant for the O.R. Simpson Honor Society (ORSHS). ORSHS is a tutoring society where you are paired up with a cadet to help him/her with the class you have taken before. My initiative stemmed from a desire to provide freshmen with ample resources to succeed academically.\nWhen I took over, it was taking longer to pair cadets manually and often a cadet would be paired up after the assignment he requested help on was already due. I quickly realized that the current system was not feasible and it motivated me to find a solution to help cadets receive real-time support. This summer, I developed an algorithm that auto-matches cadets with tutors. The society initially struggled to keep up but the algorithm eased the process for both parties as it enabled cadets to get support early and took some burden off Matching officers.\nThis experience has allowed me to serve my fellow cadets in a meaningful way and taught me the importance of taking initiative. Just as I served in ORSHS, I would continue to serve the local engineering community as part of SEC."

The SEC wanting to be a representative voice for all engineering students accomplishes this goal and takes the problems up to people who can provide support. By ensuring that no problem goes unheard, the SEC effectively helps all engineering students have a better learning experience.\nAs a part of SEC, I would prioritize being a voice for all engineering students. I would try my best to listen to everyone's needs and think of the next steps from there. Even in my past experiences, such as working at Kumon or working on a case competition, I have always listened to whatever problems my students or teammates have had and I would bring this value to SEC.",
            "Question 9": "I define success by assessing how much effort I put into a goal and seeing the outcome achieved. If I put a lot of work into a task and met most of my objectives, then I was successful in meeting my goal. This approach does me the most good because I don\u2019t become too hard on myself for not finishing in the way I had originally imagined. All of the little parts that make up the goal are still very important and achieving them is a success.\nOn my ENGR 102 project, my group coded a basketball game. We aimed to make all the players look visually appealing and have a functioning game. Because of time constraints, we were not able to get the players to look how we imagined. This made me question if I should\u2019ve dedicated more time. Should I have sacrificed time away from other classes to make this game better? This led me down a path of being tough on myself to accomplish the full idea. Through reflecting on this, I grew into my current mindset of evaluating success by the amount of effort I put into it, not just the final product.\nWithin SEC, I would bring along this mindset and bring up people who are too hard on themselves over goals they have. I would try my hardest to meet my goals and if the outcome accomplishes the goal but not how I imagined it, it would still count as success.",
            "Question 10": "During my senior year of high school, I was an assistant tutor at Kumon. When I would work with students, I naively thought that one explanation for a problem could teach all students. I came to a surprising realization when this was not the case after I had moved around trying to teach other kids the same problem. By the end of my time at Kumon, I was well-seasoned in communicating with people in different ways that would help them understand something.\nWith this experience, I became a new person. I was able to better understand people and how to convey information to them. As a member of SEC, I would bring along these skills with me. I would put all of my energy and effort into helping out anyone and ensuring that they leave the conversation with more knowledge than before. I would push for more awareness of communication skills and work to improve them for my peers. I think that it is very important for all members of an organization, whether they have a leadership role or not, to be able to effectively talk about their ideas and I would love to work towards achieving that goal.",
            "Question 11": "A time I served others was through my involvement in Engineers Serving the Community during the first semester of freshman year. I was a part of the Junction 505 committee where we were tasked with restoring an accessibility ramp. During the workshops, some of the committee spent a lot of time figuring out the logistics of restoring the ramp such as how much wood we would need while others mapped out how the ramp would be reconstructed. I was a part of the team that went and bought all of the needed items from the hardware store and participated in some of the actual reconstruction on site.\nBeing a part of this committee brought me much joy. I was excited to be a part of a team that made a ramp that allowed more people to access a building. I was ecstatic that my small contributions to the project would end up leading to a final outcome that served the people who could only access the building through the ramp.\nI am ready to use the skills I gained from this community project and apply them to future projects and tasks in the SEC."

When I first came to A&M, I had blindly followed the hype around computer science, drawn to it because of its pay and prestige. As a freshman, it\u2019s common to follow what your peers consider successful and to be naive about exploring different engineering fields. However, after attending multiple industry nights and DI Saturdays, my perspective on engineering broadened. Growing up, I was always involved in the family business. Discovering that business and engineering could go hand in hand reignited a sense of nostalgia with my current passion for engineering. Initially, I saw these two fields as unrelated, but after discussing them with professors and industry partners who blended both areas, I became eager to learn more. Now, as an Industrial Distribution major, I want to provide the same opportunities for incoming freshmen. I believe programs like TAMUEMC are extremely important, and I am committed to help expand programs like these to offer mentorships and broaden career opportunities for as many freshmen as possible.",
            "Question 9": "As a drum major, I once gave a speech to the band after a football game, comparing our goals as a group to defeating the Ender Dragon in Minecraft. In marching band, you create a show with multiple parts, and by the time we had completed the major goal of learning the entire show, many members began to let their guard down. This lapse was evident in both our practice sessions and our performances on the field. Much like in Minecraft, where slaying the Ender Dragon is often seen as the end of the journey, finishing the show was not the end of our work. The game continues with new challenges: you go on to the End City, get your Elytra, and upgrade your armor to an impenetrable state. Similarly, in marching band, completing the show doesn\u2019t mean you can't still improve your skills in marching style or artistic playing. Everything can be enhanced if you look for ways to improve. This mindset applies to any goal in life. Many people do just enough to get by, but if you want to stand out and excel, you must go above and beyond what is expected. During my internships, for instance, I could have easily sat around after completing my tasks, but instead, I chose to make the most of my time by learning more about the industry and asking questions to my mentors. Being eager to strive beyond your goals provides endless opportunities for personal and professional growth.",
            "Question 10": "Last year, I had the privilege of being an Assistant Director of MSC FISH. In this role, I was given the responsibility of developing freshmen through the tasks I would delegate to them. Initially the dynamic was seen as artificial. I would explain the task and tell them to have it done by the end of the week. The freshman were nowhere near excited to come to meetings and I struggled to get them to complete their assignments on time. When I assigned work, I often detached its meaning from the organization and forgot the \u201cwhy\u201d and purpose I joined the organization in the first place. The reason why the freshman dreaded the work I assigned was because there was a lack of connection and relationship between us and the work we were doing. With this new thought in mind, I worked harder on building a personal connection with the freshman in my marketing group. I took them out for lunch, I asked about their hobbies, and showed genuine interest in their commitments. Through these interactions, I remembered why we were doing all this work to begin with. To build relationships. As a result, the freshman\u2019s attentiveness and desire to work increased. The conversations we would have at meetings went from the work being assigned to what else we could do to increase engagement inside and outside our organization. Through this experience, I learned to first build a personal connection with my peers so that our work has a purpose.",
            "Question 11": "Last semester, the service organization I was a part of, hosted a 5K race at Kyle Field known as Run the Ramps in partnership with Soles4Souls. I was responsible for marketing this event and increasing attendance. By the registration deadline, we had attracted around 300 participants from all over Texas and raised $12,000. While all were there to run a 5K, I learned that most came for a deeper purpose. Runners shared personal stories about how Soles4Souls had positively impacted individuals\u2019 lives that they knew. These conversations revealed that each participant saw their involvement not just as a run but as a way to contribute to a meaningful cause that impacted them personally. Seeing this dedication, I felt like something that was just my job became something bigger than myself. It wasn't just about the numbers or the attendance of the event, but it was the real difference and impact we were making in people's lives. This experience taught me that service is the most powerful when we understand and connect with the purpose behind our actions.

For me, true success is measured by how a goal\u2019s achievement extends beyond personal gain, allowing me to support and uplift others.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others occurred during middle school when I worked at a mechanic shop, doing oil changes and helping replace car parts. This experience taught me that success isn't defined by formal education. There's immense value in the knowledge and skills acquired through hands-on work and trades. It opened my eyes to the diverse paths people take in life and made me more open to collaborating with individuals from different backgrounds.\nThis perspective proved invaluable during my internship at a refinery, where I noticed that some engineers struggled to communicate effectively with operators who didn't have college degrees or had not completed high school. However, because of my earlier experience, I was able to connect with these operators easily. We worked together like a well-oiled machine. I recognized that operators often possess the most practical experience in the plant, and I made it a point to absorb as much knowledge as I could from them. We bonded over shared interests like hobbies and sports, which strengthened our working relationship and made the experience both educational and enjoyable.\nThis experience highlights the importance of valuing diverse perspectives and learning from everyone, regardless of their educational background. It\u2019s a lesson that continues to influence how I approach teamwork and collaboration today.",
            "Question 11": "During my time as an intern, I was fortunate to excel in my role, which placed me in good standing with the company. My strong performance not only allowed me to gain valuable experience but also positioned me to help others, a responsibility I take seriously and love to do.\nOne of the most rewarding moments came when I had the opportunity to refer a close friend who was a year younger than me. Recognizing his potential and knowing how much an internship could impact his career, I recommended him to my supervisors. He successfully passed the interview and secured the internship. being able to watch him thrive in his professional journey has been incredible and satisfying.\nI\u2019ve always believed in helping others when you can, and this experience reinforced my commitment to helping those around me. It\u2019s this passion for helping people that drives me, and I\u2019m always eager to serve others in any way I can."

            "Question 8": "I resonate most with the pillar of professional advancement because giving students the ability to leave college with a strong confidence in their skills and potential career options right after graduation is pertinent. Going to industry nights as a freshman, I saw for the first time what that professional industry environment would resemble. These events, from the industry nights to career fairs, help make aspects of the future less daunting and bring the meaning of \u201cadvancement\u201d to light; the industry nights guided and helped me enter the professional engineering world. That is why the pillar of professional advancement is so important to me, because, in a way, the other pillars mission\u2019s wouldn\u2019t entirely be fulfilled if students don\u2019t have that self-assurance, not being developed enough with guidance to use their \u2018representative voice\u2019 or indulge in events spreading \u2018engineering awareness.\u2019 In SEC, I could give the first-year students that feeling of preparedness through the Development Committee. No matter how many technical skills one may have, soft skills are just as important in a successful future, and professional advancement does just that: advance those skills.",
            "Question 9": "Success, to me, isn\u2019t measured by anything quantifiable but by a feeling. Growing up with constant anxiety in social situations, I always had the goal of not being as anxious all of the time. I wanted so badly to be able to walk into a room without overthinking or ask for a to-go box at a restaurant without nerves. High school was when I got tired of being constantly stressed out, so I set a general goal: to be less nervous, less anxious, and less tense at every moment. This long-term goal, which I still have to this day, has been marked by many milestones. Whether it was me volunteering to answer a question in class, asking for directions in a grocery store, or finally being able to ask for that to-go box, I was slowly making progress, reflecting on being much happier and more relaxed. I was content and continue to be content in my progress as I meet more people, get further involved in organizations, and make connections with individuals I never would have before. Success to me is growing, and through that growth, I have become much more confident in applying myself to be the best leader I can be, both during and outside of school, in projects and organizations.",
            "Question 10": "I worked at a youth gymnastics camp the summer before my junior year of high school. On the first day of camp, I expected the day to go by like a breeze, with no trouble at all, and leave looking forward to the rest of the summer. Instead, the day was a trainwreck, with all sorts of obstacles, and I went home overwhelmed and cried to my mom for an hour. However, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t give up and took on the challenge with open arms. When the kids tested me over the different gym rules, I sought out the guidance of my fellow counselors and grasped how to be more assertive with said rules. When I was bombarded with questions from the children, I learned to facilitate and communicate with the kids on their level. These skills I developed guided me through the rest of the summer with ease, and I began looking forward to my camp days. Not only did I make an impact on these kids, but they also unknowingly made a lasting impact on who I am as a person. That is why, yes, working with a whole different group of people than you\u2019re used to can be challenging and sometimes intimidating, however, you may miss out on opportunities to develop collaboration and communication skills, those of which can be greatly applied to all aspects of life.",
            "Question 11": "While I have served others in multiple ways, from volunteering at a food pantry to helping run different fundraisers, I consistently serve others day-to-day in the way that I listen. Whether it\u2019s listening to my roommates go through their day, or a classmate describing a problem that they are having, I am always there to be on the receiving end. Being an active listener is a skill that's always come easy for me, and applying it to help others produces no better feeling. One moment where this meant a lot to me was when my mother confided in me about a situation that was going on in her life. In that moment, I was able to be there as she shared everything that she was feeling, and it filled me with gratitude to be able to finally give her support where she needed it, after so many years of her being there for me. Sometimes the actions you take may seem small or insignificant, however, the impact may be bigger than you truly realize, and that is why serving my community and peers is a natural decision that I believe helps me further develop as an individual."

During my involvement within my high school\u2019s news station program, I was able to be the representative voice of students by producing weekly shows that showcased recent events happening around campus, such as school-wide events, student achievements, and addressing student and faculty concerns. Furthermore, I would be entrusted with representing the program during weekly meetings held with administration members for the show to be approved. In college, as part of the A-Line fashion magazine, I was able to use my graphic design skills to highlight and showcase various aspects of the magazine and the community behind it. Through these organizations, I\u2019ve been able to express my passion for digital media, as well being the representative voice of others. This pillar means the most to me because it aligns with my passion to represent others in a creative yet meaningful manner, and I hope that, as part of SEC, I\u2019m able to further develop my passion and creativity in new ways.",
            "Question 9": "During this previous summer, I ended up taking a summer class which, although wasn\u2019t the most difficult, was very time-consuming and required many hours out of my week. Unfortunately, though, during the same week that the class ended up being even more time intensive than usual, my family decided to go on a spontaneous vacation, giving me only a few days to prepare before we left. So, knowing that we were leaving Thursday morning and coming back the following Monday, I knew I had to finish my homework before I went to sleep on Wednesday. So, with that goal in mind, I strived to complete it. However, my habit of procrastinating things until the last minute ended up leading to me not completing any work for the class up until Wednesday night, where I was only able to get through a couple problems. Despite my failed attempt of trying to get my work done early, I knew I still had to get the assignments completed. So, with the time I had left until the due date, I worked hard to finish the assignments I had during the nights of my vacation. Although I wasn\u2019t able to succeed initially, my perseverance and decision to not give up allowed me to still thrive, even if it meant creating a new goal for myself. Since this experience, I\u2019ve not only been more careful about upcoming deadlines, but also have been more tenacious to complete my goals and succeed no matter the circumstances.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that contributed heavily to shaping my perspective on collaboration and leadership took place during my involvement in my high school\u2019s PAL program, where I mentored students at feeder schools once a week. Specifically, I would go to a local middle school where I would meet with a student there, Noah. During the first few meetings, Noah was very reserved. But, as we continued to meet over the year, I was able to learn more about him, such as his interests, and his academic strengths and weaknesses. This opportunity showed me the importance of consistent effort and the effects it can have on those impacted by it. It also gave me a direct experience in seeing how my effort to show up would encourage the development of trust, growth, and friendship in the relationships in my life. Each visit helped to reinforce the importance of being not just physically present, but also emotionally. During our visits, our growing bond and his academic growth were evidence as to how my presence was leaving a lasting impact on his life. This experience helped to shape my perspective on working with others since it allowed me to see, firsthand, how my efforts can affect others in a positive manner, and it ignited a new passion for working with others. This experience inspired me to become more proactive in other aspects of my life, where I\u2019m able to use what I learned about being present to make a difference in my current relationships.",
            "Question 11": "One time I served others was during my participation in the Big Event last year, where I volunteered to serve a local Aggie family and help them declutter their property. During this time, I spent a lot of it working with my friends to help pick up trash, clear out patches of land, and clean up the property. Though the work was very exhausting, it felt good to be able to assist them. The family had recently bought the property to settle in, and I am honored that we were able to lend a helping hand during a new chapter of their lives. It was exciting to have such a significant impact on a special point in their lives. My service not only contributed to leaving a lasting impression on them, but it also left a lasting impression on me. By cleaning their property, we were not only improving their residence, but also contributing to creating a supportive environment where the family can thrive. It showed me how serving is more than just completing tasks, but rather, creating a positive change in a community that will ripple through the lives of those who are impacted by it."

            "Question 8": "Although all pillars of the SEC Mission Statement have their importance, to increase engineering awareness resonates the most to me. When I was a freshman transitioning into A&M, I still didn\u2019t have much clue as to what I wanted to do in terms of career or industry experience, and I know I\u2019m not alone in this regard. Many people end up changing what their final ETAM application is, discover new sub sectors within their broad degree, or even decide to leave engineering altogether. When I first applied to A&M, I thought that what I wanted was to pursue computer engineering, but during my year in general engineering I made an effort to keep an open mind while hearing about what other potential majors had to offer. I thankfully had the opportunity to discover a major that suited me better thanks to events such as DI Saturday and other opportunities listed in the SEC\u2019s emails. When speaking to current engineering freshmen, I find that most of them need the type of guidance that the SEC gave me, so I would love to be part of the solution that could help them directly.",
            "Question 9": "Throughout my life, I\u2019ve always prioritized finding comfort in whatever I do. I believe comfort serves as a holistic evaluation of most anything in life. When finding myself in a scenario regardless of what it is, I always strive to become comfortable. I should also note that there is a difference between becoming complacent in comfort and the actual pursuit of comfort. It\u2019s pushing ourselves into new, unknown scenarios that pushes development as an individual. Then, once understanding how a seemingly frightening situation can be managed and improved is where self-improvement occurs. As a student, I find new material or exams stressful, but I have to push myself to study until academics become comfortable. As someone transitioning into college, I find myself surrounded by strangers more often than not, but I have to make an effort to find a place to call home in order to become comfortable. As an engineer, whenever facing a problem or mechanic I don\u2019t understand, I need to make these situations understandable until I can approach them in comfort. Comfort has always served me as a goal because it signifies when you\u2019ve reached a place where your instincts feel satisfied with your position, and I find the more times I solve my problems the more likely I am to find easy solutions to discomfort in the future.",
            "Question 10": "Two years ago, I started my position as a theatrical tech crew lead. It would turn out to be the greatest experience of my life which I still keep in touch with to this day; however, in the moment I was honestly quite miserable with the entire process. It\u2019s almost unfathomable considering how I found what I genuinely consider a second home amongst these people, but I just simply did not feel a personal connection with any of them during the early days of the process. Thankfully, I managed to open up and change my mindset when approaching these strangers. Once I gave them a proper chance I found that building a proper connection with your teammates makes working with them a completely different experience. It feels so obvious now in hindsight, but sometimes it proves more difficult than expected to build a genuine bond. It\u2019s such obvious advice, but it took personal experience for me to understand how work can become enjoyable as long as you love the people you surround yourself with. By the end of the year, I felt like I had a group of people who I could truly rely on, and I knew undoubtedly that they trusted me too. So, now I strive to always find a community wherever I go. Building a collective bond over a project no matter what it is proved vital in having a long-standing effective team, and I know that\u2019ll apply for everything going forward in life.",
            "Question 11": "The process of serving others is a continuous endeavor that whether intentionally or not most people engage with on a regular basis. Over the years I\u2019ve participated in volunteering opportunities from trash clean ups, blood drives, food banks, etc. A few of the collegiate orgs I\u2019m in also do volunteering: RAMPS which is part of a nonprofit that uses carpentry to build physical handicap access ramps for those in need, MSC FISH hosts Kyle Field Day where a multitude of volunteering booths are set up in the councorses of Kyle Field, and I\u2019ve volunteered with BUILD to help retrofit shipping containers into medical clinics. However, what serving others truly makes me think about are the friends and family I\u2019ve poured my heart into. Every single person on this planet faces their own personal struggles, and sometimes no matter how hard people try they fall flat of finding a solution, feeling happy with themselves, or having security in their position. Although I admittedly can\u2019t just magically fix everything, I truly value trying to offer at least some semblance of comfort or advice when possible."

            "Question 8": "The external section of SEC\u2019s mission means the most to me. I didn\u2019t have much opportunity to experience engineering until highschool. By then the pressure to choose a career field is all around you and it\u2019s overwhelming without little real knowledge or experience. Engineer\u2019s week and EnVision are two aspects I especially admire SEC for. My little sister is 6 years old and absolutely loved the last EnVision conference. Seeing the impact it made on her proves how important exposure is. There are so many different paths in Engineering and finding something you love is challenging but rewarding. Unfortunately, because engineering is a very daunting field, I feel as if many people don\u2019t believe in their ability to succeed simply because they don\u2019t have the proper support system. By reaching out to the local community SEC can foster interest and start that support system early. It\u2019s easy to sell yourself short when there\u2019s no one there to remind you of your worth. In connection, engineer\u2019s week is a great way SEC supports the engineering community at Texas A&M and increases exposure in the Bryan-College Station area. SEC\u2019s external aspect makes a positive impact on current and future engineers.",
            "Question 9": "Success for me means I have grown from when I started the process. For example, over the summer I conducted research with a professor. Although the project itself was nothing that would get me noticed by a research paper, I gained valuable skills throughout the process. Whenever I hit a setback and began to grow frustrated with my progress, I tried to look at it from the perspective of what I learned by overcoming this setback. At one point I had trouble with the wiring for the drone I was working on. I knew to fix it I would be delayed finishing the project, however it meant I could learn how to solder. That setback hindered the success of the physical project, but gave me an opportunity to learn a skill I will continue to use throughout my career. Aside from gaining knowledge and skills, I also define success by my response to a situation. Throughout the course of my research I hit many setbacks in the initial planning stage. Working out the software I would need to develop before even touching a drone meant running into a lot of dead ends. From the beginning of the semester I can confidently say that I handle setbacks significantly better than I used to. I developed good habits of problem-solving with logic instead of becoming fixated on the frustration. I see success if I can look back and see all the ways I have grown either mentally or academically from the start.",
            "Question 10": "This past semester I was accepted into the SAE project team here on campus. I was placed on a subteam where I was the only new member in an experienced group that had already been through a few competition seasons before. The learning curve was steep, and still is steep, but from it I have gained valuable insight into working with others. Although I have worked in groups many times, now I was part of a capable and fast-paced group that sometimes left me feeling lost and behind. Before then I had only ever worked in a group on projects where I had a solid foundation already and felt confident I could contribute my part. It was a new experience for me having to frequently ask questions and accept that I was going to feel lost for a while. Luckily for me the other members of my subteam are amazing and kind people who have, and continue to, support me with understanding and patience. In all my previous experiences working with others I always saw group projects as requiring an equal contribution from each member to be a success. Now, after being on the flip side of the situation, I see how working and relying on others comes hand in hand in supporting them as well. Like the saying \u201chelp me help you,\u201d working with others requires understanding and developing individual strengths to work together towards the goal.",
            "Question 11": "My sophomore year in Aerospace Engineering I took a computer science class that left me in peer tutoring multiple times a week. Most times I would be in a room with 4 peer tutors and 20 computer science students needing help. Usually a few of us had made more progress than others and would spend our time waiting helping those where we could. Many times I found myself working to explain a concept to another student while waiting for help myself. And on the flip side others helped me through my own problem just as much as I helped them. We all understood the frustration of being stuck, so it was common that even after my problem was fixed, I would stay for a few more hours and help where I could. The hours I spent in that room gave me a sense of community as we collaborated to help each other. Just as much as I helped serve others, they helped me as well. It was this community of service that myself and so many others contributed to that I have to thank for my success in the class."

I printed my, admittedly mediocre, resume, dressed in business attire, and went to talk to companies. Within the next hour, I had talked to other freshmen who all sounded so ahead of me, so experienced, that when compared to them, I felt that even if I did go to the career fair, I would be wasting not only my time but the recruiters\u2019 time as well. That feeling was what made the SEC\u2019s efforts to foster the professional advancement of all engineering students so important to me. After that night, I pushed myself to grow professionally, by attending resume reviews and mock interviews, I was able to instill a certain degree of confidence in myself and make my transition from academic to professional life a smoother journey. Through the SEC, I want to help other students who were in my position, those struggling to make that adjustment to the industry feel less daunting, and provide them with resources and guidance to succeed in their transition from academia to professional life.",
            "Question 9": "In the Summer of 2020, bored in the middle of the pandemic, I was scrolling through Instagram when I came across instructions for crocheting a patchwork cardigan. Now, keep in mind that to make it, you need to know how to crochet. I also, conveniently, didn\u2019t. At that point, I had made up my mind that I would make that cardigan by the end of summer.\nWhile it would be nice to say that I succeeded and immediately took to the craft, I instead spent the next 3 months following the wrong pattern and had to undo the entire thing. Even then, out of resilience, or as others would call it, sheer stubbornness, I pushed myself to redo it and fix the immense amount of mistakes that I made throughout the year. It was, however, because of these mistakes in the first place that I was able to learn and improve my techniques and understanding of the craft. Even though it could be argued that I failed in my goals since I didn\u2019t meet the deadline I set for myself, it was because of them in the first place that I was given the chance to push myself out of my comfort zone so that I could learn a skill that was completely foreign to me. I did eventually finish that cardigan (in another 4 months), and with it, I gained a passion for crocheting, something that I still do and learn from to this day.",
            "Question 10": "Two years ago, in my senior year of high school, I was put in charge of a small group of people where we developed an original video game from start to finish in the span of a few months. This video game was called \u201cLittle Red\u201d, a top-down arcade-style survival game in which you played as Little Red Riding Hood avoiding the wolves and trying to get to her grandma\u2019s cabin in the woods. Within this group, I helped facilitate the communication and tasks between the developers and the designers while simultaneously coding the heavier parts of the project. While 2 people were working on the art and designs, the rest of the developers were in charge of integrating what the art team produced and adding game mechanics to the sprites. As the project lead, it progressively got harder to keep up with what each individual was working on at a time, and along with my work with the project, it slowly got overwhelming. It wasn\u2019t until I started sharing these struggles with some of the others on the team that I realized how important communication is and that being a leader doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t rely on the support of others when it gets too much. Through this experience, I realized that a team shouldn\u2019t be seen as a burden dragging you down, but rather as a support system to be utilized to produce the best quality product at the end of the day.",
            "Question 11": "It was the crack of dawn on a random Saturday when my mom dragged me out of the house. As we were driving to our location, all I felt was irritated at being woken up so early, not even bothering to ask where I was being taken. It wasn\u2019t until we reached the newly built North Texas Food Bank that I realized what we were going to do.\nWhat was originally an annoyance quickly became replaced by a quick rush to pack boxes with canned foods for families who needed them for the next 3 hours. By the end of the three hours, sure my legs and arms were sore from carrying heavy boxes, but I was shocked with how satisfied I felt with the work.\nThis satisfaction is what drove me to sign up for the readily available shifts every Saturday, especially after I got my driver's license, to do whatever they needed people for. Volunteering at the NTFB has taught me so much, from how much good can be accomplished through teamwork to the gratitude that I now hold toward the people and opportunities given to me that both directly and indirectly made me who I am today."

Providing insight into how engineers shape our world through STEM fairs or workshops is what inspires the curiosity of many different minds, and opens them up to a new world of creativity. These events can show people how engineering is a diverse path with many different professions and help them gain an appreciation for what engineers do. I personally like connecting with people and sharing my experiences with engineering to put into perspective the amazing things that we can do. It\u2019s not just about understanding technology but showing what we do and how it impacts society. Engineering awareness is how we got here in the first place and it's important that we keep the tradition of sharing the world of engineering to others.",
            "Question 9": "My dad and I enjoy going on strenuous hikes together and we made a goal to do our hardest hike yet before the start of my sophomore year. It would be a physically demanding hike lasting multiple days through thousands of feet of elevation change. While training for the hike, the one thing I thought of was how the feeling of success would come after the hike was completed. However, during the hike, as we climbed through the trail and through the rough terrain, I realized I needed to redefine the way I thought about success. I recognized that all the hard work I put into preparing helped increase my mental and physical resilience which helped my confidence throughout the challenging hike, making it almost simple. I realized that success isn\u2019t just measured by the outcome, but also by the progress and personal development while striving towards it.",

The resources were limited, and the lack of modern tools added to the challenge. On top of this, I was in a country that with a completely different culture than ours. Despite that, the community warmly welcomed us and were eager to get started. The language barrier was not as bad an issue I assumed it would be. We easily communicated through gestures and being patient with each other. This experience taught me that communication isn\u2019t always the most important trait in a team, but having a clearly defined goal and a team with a diverse set of skills will get any job done just as well.",
            "Question 11": "Hurricane Harvey was the most devastating storm in the entire history of Houston. The storm brought immense flooding over the course of three days and caused $125 billion in damages. I had the great privilege to work with the organization Eight Days of Hope in their efforts to rebuild homes and relieve the families that were displaced by the floods. My family joined their Rebuilding Ministry to provide immediate aid to homes that were requiring assistance and rebuilding. We worked on kitchens, hung sheet rock, and removed debris. The work never seemed to end, but my family had a sense of purpose which helped us stay motivated. Seeing families return to their home that they thought they would never get to live in again was rewarding, and it taught me how powerful communities can be when faced with adversity. My experience of serving with Eight Days of Hope helped develop a greater sense of compassion and changed my perspective on serving."

            "Question 8": "The professional advancement pillar means the most to me because as an engineering student, college and academics can easily take priority in one's life. Many of us may forget that there is an \u2018after college\u2019, and that is our career. There are numerous companies searching for people to fill their internships, co-ops, and full-time positions. It is nearly impossible to find and apply to them all. SEC helps bridge the gap between students and career opportunities, by making those resources easier to access. An example is Career Fair, where thousands of students and recruiters come together every year to connect. I attended as a freshman and as a sophomore, and both times I was introduced to a variety of companies from multiple industries, each with valuable opportunities that I didn\u2019t even know existed. I made personal connections with the recruiters, with some of them remembering me through the years. I want to join the SEC so I can help in planning, organizing, and executing a successful Career Fair that helps out thousands of Aggies every year. I want to be a part of every Aggie\u2019s journey, from college, through their transition into the professional world, and to their career life.",
            "Question 9": "For nine years, I attended Vietnamese school. Every Sunday for three hours, I sat in a classroom learning about the Vietnamese language and culture. Having an extra three hours of school each week and homework on top of regular school was not fun growing up, but my goal was to commit for those nine years and graduate. It wasn't until I graduated from Vietnamese school that I truly reflected on those years of my life and was grateful for the opportunity and experience to learn about a culture and language I wouldn\u2019t have learned otherwise. After I graduated, I returned as a volunteer teacher assistant where I helped teach the next generation of kids Vietnamese. I was in charge of a 4th grade class where I used my experience as a student who was once in their shoes, to work to make learning Vietnamese as fun, engaging, and interactive as possible. Learning a language is one thing, but teaching that language is entirely another. To be able to give back to the community that served me for nearly a decade is one of my proudest achievements in life. I used to look up to my teacher assistants as a student, and later I became one of those teacher assistants that my students looked up to. I was on the other side, teaching students and reminding them of the value of the education that they were earning. This experience is a large part of what makes me who I am today.",
            "Question 10": "I volunteered with a nonprofit organization called Strive2Thrive Education, where I tutored students in Vietnam the English language. I was tasked to create lesson plans for tutors to use, and after delivering fast yet quality work, I was given the role of Head of Content Creation for Project Vietnam. I worked with a team of volunteers in creating lesson plans and building a curriculum that tutors in the organization could use. I used my experience as a tutor to create lesson plans that I as a tutor would want to use to teach English. With this team, I delegated lesson plans based on material topics and reviewed their work. When my team members were struggling with ideas on how to teach a topic, I would assist in brainstorming and creating activities. One member was tasked with creating an activity to teach fruits. We came up with a game, where the class would split into two and one person from each team would have to quickly write the English word of a fruit and whichever team gets it first and correct would win. I would test out the lesson plans when tutoring and I found that students liked the game and it helped them practice their English comprehension and spelling skills. Through this experience, I learned that working with others can lead to creative outcomes that otherwise might not have been produced, as different perspectives and opinions are considered, and new ideas can be created that overall work to benefit others.",
            "Question 11": "I was a member of MSC FLI or Freshman Leadership International, a FLO at TAMU. Last year, we put on a huge annual event called Campus Cultural Spotlight, where the goal of the program is to shed light on an underrepresented community at TAMU. The country and culture of focus was South Korea. This free event included a trivia game and prizes, dance performances by the Korean Dance Association, and Korean food. I stepped up and took the leadership position of serving as the emcee. My responsibilities included leading the trivia game, introducing the dance performances, communicating with the crowd as to what was to come, and overall lead the event. My contribution helped us put on a successful event, as we had record audience turnout and overall positive feedback from those that attended. Most importantly, we as a campus celebrated and learned more about South Korean culture and our South Korean Aggies were able to feel seen, heard, and recognized. This year, I am a staff member for MSC FLI, and I look forward to mentoring the freshmen and helping them plan, organize, and execute this year\u2019s Campus Cultural Spotlight, where a new country and culture will be celebrated."

            "Question 8": "Engineering awareness is the pillar of the SEC Mission Statement that resonates most with me, as it aligns with my passion for inspiring and educating others. After high school, I was unsure of which engineering major to pursue. I discovered materials science during my freshman year at A&M, thanks to the guidance and support of the Materials Science Ambassadors. This experience sparked my desire to help others navigate their own journeys, particularly in lesser-known fields like materials science. Now, as a Materials Science Ambassador myself, I hope to provide the same encouragement to future students. Additionally, through my involvement in outreach with Engineers Serving the Community, I also help educate others about the impact of engineering. I believe that raising awareness is key to empowering future engineers to explore their potential and make meaningful contributions to the world.",
            "Question 9": "Success, to me, means excelling in areas that once made me uncomfortable. In high school, I decided that I needed to strengthen my public speaking and presentation skills. Despite not pursuing a business-oriented career, I decided to challenge myself by competing in DECA, a business and professional development competition. I believed the skills I could gain would be valuable regardless of the field I ultimately chose. Even though I was initially hesitant, I took the lead in forming a team of three students to compete in a Business Operations Research Event. Together, we put in hours creating our presentation, continuously seeking feedback from those with more experience, and redrafting our proposed business plan. This dedication to improvement paid off. We advanced from the district level to the state level, and eventually to the international stage. This achievement, especially in my first year participating, defined success for me: surpassing my initial goal and excelling in an area that once needed improvement.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was serving as an executive officer for my high school's chapter of the National Honor Society (NHS). With over 300 students attending general meetings, the responsibility of generating fundraising ideas fell to the officers, as communication was difficult. At times, though, our ideas lacked inspiration. To address this, I suggested introducing a system where students could submit their own ideas, suggestions, and feedback via a QR code at the end of each meeting. This small change opened my eyes to the power of collective thinking. The diversity of ideas we received was something we, as officers, could not have come up with on our own. The creativity and engagement of our peers resulted in fundraisers that were both innovative and successful. By the end of the semester, we raised over $2,500 for the school and local nonprofits. This experience taught me how working with others can lead to far greater outcomes than working in isolation.",
            "Question 11": "A time when I served others was through my involvement with Engineers Serving the Community, where I had the opportunity to combine my passion for community service with my engineering skills. I joined a committee that collaborated with Junction 505, a local nonprofit that provides job opportunities for disabled individuals.\nIn this role, we designed projects using CAD software and then brought them to life through hands-on construction. It was an incredible experience, knowing that the work we did not only served a vital need in the community but also enhanced my engineering education. Additionally, I gained practical skills, such as learning how to use power tools, which had been a personal goal of mine. This experience reinforced the idea that serving others can be both personally fulfilling and professionally enriching."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that stands out the most to me is Professional Advancement. Professional advancement is the most important because engineers at Texas A&M should be successful in their field after college. Professional advancement works towards educating many undergraduate students in different professions and allows them to pick one in which they are interested. This pillar consists of helping young students network and enhance their competitiveness in the real world. Networking is one of the most important aspects of one's career as it is one of the main ways a young student can acquire a job/internship. Networking has personally helped me gain much-needed knowledge in my field of software engineering by making me become a more competitive applicant for internships. It has also helped to make my resume sound more professional and has helped me become more competitive by informing me of what skills to acquire before going into an interview. Overall I believe that networking and competitiveness are some of the most important skills a young engineer can have as they allow you to succeed professionally. This is why the professional advancement pillar stands out to me the most.",
            "Question 9": "In this last year, the goal that I set for myself was to get the auto-admit for ETAM and also get my certification for AWS. I knew this goal would be quite difficult as classes for general engineering are made to be quite challenging and learning a certification on top of that would need a skilled level of time management. I defined success through working towards this goal and by establishing the skills and tasks I would need to complete to achieve this goal. First, I created a structured calendar that would plan out the different tasks I wanted to achieve at certain times. Throughout this, I made sure to stay accountable and maintain consistent progress to reach each checkpoint. However during busy periods, when I was unable to reach some of these checkpoints, I would reflect afterward on how I could reform my work ethic and determine what new actions I must take to be successful. It instilled a cycle of growth and learning to be adaptable. Overall, I believe that my success is defined by the meticulous steps I lay out and strive to achieve to fulfill my goal. When I have a goal, the road to achieving it will never be simple, so I believe that it is important you adapt and change your methods to make sure a goal is achieved.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was when I had the opportunity to coach a group of 30 students in table tennis alongside two other coaches. Seeing as there was a group of 30 kids, all with different skills, we had to adapt and tailor our lessons to cater to each of their needs at that instance. As this was quite challenging, this shaped my perspective when it came to collaborative efforts as it highlighted the importance of communication and adaptability. When tackling these challenges, I learned the importance of communication when working with others as each of us three coaches usually had different methods to approach the same lesson. We had to spend ample time communicating what parts of each person's lessons we thought would contribute to making the most effective lessons. While teaching the lesson itself, we realized that various parts were flawed, requiring us to adapt quickly and change the lesson mid-way. This allowed me to understand the perspective of being quick on your feet and adapting to changes if they do not suit your current plan. Overall this time working with others helped me understand the right skills needed when working with a group of people.",
            "Question 11": "One time I served others was when I volunteered at the food bank for NTFB working with a team to package food. I have been passionate about the issue of world hunger as seeing homeless people in different cities has motivated to improve society around me. This experience of serving others taught me about how working in a group can help better the society around us. Looking back at it we were split up into four groups of ten with each group having an assembly line to package all the food. This experience was beneficial for me to understand how to work efficiently in a team of several people. It is often easy to get away from your task and start doing more work, so I learned the importance of taking initiative in a team to ensure that nobody sways off task. Since our team was working well together we were able to make almost 300 crates of food ready to be shipped to people in need. Seeing this number meant much to me as the reward I had that day for volunteering was meeting an amazing group of people who were willing to make a difference too."

            "Question 9": "Before summer started at the end of my freshman year, I made a promise to myself to not waste time like I did in all of my previous summers. This time, I made a set plan of what I wanted to accomplish and what I wanted to do with the summer that was ahead of me. I had three main goals: get a summer job, finish two summer classes, and spend as much time with my family as I can. Whilst the third may not be measurable on a scale for the determination of success, I did work a summer job throughout the entirety of summer as well as complete two classes that further helped me advance along my degree plan. As for the third goal, which was the most important to me, I set aside time every day that I could to spend time with my little 10-year-old brother. Every time I leave home and head off to college, he's always completely in tears and it truly breaks my heart. As a result of this, I make it a point to spend as much time with him at home as I can. Almost every day I spend with him, I ask him, \"Did I spend enough time with you today?\", and whenever he responds by saying \"Yes\" or something similar, I know I've succeeded in what is truly important to me.",
            "Question 10": "This past summer, I worked as a stock associate at Abercrombie Kids at the local mall. Working for the first time in a retail setting, I learned many lessons that I can carry on into my professional and personal life. Throughout my experiences there, we had to fold clothes, keep the store clean, put security tags on clothes, clean the fitting rooms, and much more. Although none of us were designated \"fitting-room cleaners\" or \"clothes folders\", we all had to properly communicate and work as a team to complete all of the tasks at hand. Through my experiences working there, I understood how vital it was that each employee communicated properly and did their part to complete all of the tasks that were to be done. Another critical lesson I learned was the ability to properly delegate your time when there are multiple tasks at hand. For example, if my manager asked me to fold clothes at a certain table but I noticed the fitting room line backing up, I'd have to put the folding on hold to help the customers in line. Whilst this may not seem like much, it emphasizes the importance of urgency of situations since helping customers quickly get to the fitting rooms was more important to the store's bottom line than folding clothes at a table. Working in a retail setting taught me skills that I would not have otherwise learned and changed my perspective on the importance of working as a team.",
            "Question 11": "During my senior year of high school, I worked as a pharmacy technician trainee for free for the duration of my assignment which was 130 hours. Throughout the whole assignment, I learned many lessons about communication and individual responsibility and was able to give back to the community simultaneously. One way our pharmacy was able to serve others and our community was to offer 5 free Covid tests to all those who asked. Whilst this was not publicly posted, it was available to whoever requested it. Throughout my work assignment, I made it a mission to tell every customer I could about our pharmacy offerings so that they too could claim their free Covid tests. Whilst it may not seem like much from an outside perspective, I felt very fulfilled in my work as I was handing out covid tests left and right and it made me feel like I was giving back to my community in the best way I could. Through this opportunity, I was able to serve others by volunteering my time to fill out prescriptions and distributing Covid testing kits whenever I could."

            "Question 8": "To me, increasing engineering awareness is deeply important to ensure that we have the capability to innovate, develop, and sustain our planet. With a growing need for engineers today, it is necessary that we reach out to young curious minds and expose them to how they can fit into a field that allows them to make an impact in people's lives. My fortunate situation, being born with an engineering father, allowed me to be intrigued with engineering fairly early into high school and gave me a head start into looking towards my career. However, many high schoolers have no idea what potential they have and are often lost in what a career could look like for them. This is why I believe it\u2019s crucial for college students to engage with the younger generation and assist them in their path toward a promising career. During my volunteering experience with young STEM students at the middle school science Olympiad, it allowed me to interact with and discover what many of these students are interested in becoming. Many of them desired to be engineers and were captivated with problem-solving thanks to individuals and programs introducing them to engineering.",
            "Question 9": "In previous experience, creating a substantial goal is not as simple as knowing where you want to end up. For a big goal to be achievable it must have a road map with an incremental set of tasks that must be performed to declare your goal a success. As a musician, I've set goals such as placing as a top performer in a region band audition and the only way I define this goal to be a success is by meeting each checkpoint along the way with maximum effort. This includes preparing my music, reading it for the first time, counting rhythms, developing tone in the piece, utilizing a metronome, consulting a private lesson teacher, and finally entering the audition room. What defines this success is not what the result is, but rather knowing that you lived up to your fullest potential by preparing in every way you could. This directly translates to engineering in many ways, for instance, a lofty goal might be to graduate top of your class in Chemical Engineering. Whether you achieve this or not is irrelevant to your personal success. There are likely those more gifted test takers or higher IQ students, nevertheless, your success is defined by the work you put in and the steps you took to achieve greatness. Failure does not stop you from being successful. Failure is necessary for success. \"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm\" - Winston Churchill",
            "Question 10": "Over this past summer working for Life Time Fitness, I got the opportunity to lead my team of lifeguards as an aquatic supervisor. On a particular Saturday afternoon shift, the team was expecting a birthday party to arrive with over fifty children in the water. During this event, there seemed to be something wrong going on the exit of the waterslides. I overheard aggressive shouts to the lifeguard from a parent telling him to \"grab him, grab him!\". I quickly got up to assist in the situation and make sure that everyone was safe. When I arrived I found a confused look on the lifeguard, who was looking for a child in danger, and a furious parent pointing in the direction of his child. The father wanted his son, who was wearing floaties, to be pushed to the wall by the lifeguard, however; the tone and volume of his voice made the situation seem critical. In a few moments, I was met with my boss, who'd come to help deflate while I served as a witness to the encounter. I backed up the lifeguard and explained what took place, how there was no danger, and that he was justifiably confused. This experience demonstrated to me the ability of a competent team to help support each other in an intense situation. When I required assistance, my boss was there in an instant just as I was there to defend one of my lifeguards.",
            "Question 11": "Last semester, in the heat of finals, one exam seemed to be the most daunting to many of my friends, Organic Chemistry II. While most people felt quite unprepared for the large amount of material that could be tested, I felt adequate since chemistry was one of my strengths. I had meticulously made packet after packet of reactions, mechanisms, and formulas that had been covered over the 4 months to guarantee I aced the exam. The week before the final, I had gotten a message from one of my friends who was incredibly stressed out with his courses and wanted some assistance in studying for the final. He was not doing so well in the course and needed to get a good score on his last test to pass the course, so I offered to be his tutor for the upcoming final. We met multiple times over the next few days until he was as confident as I that he'd not only pass but achieve a respectable grade. This not only boosted my confidence in the material but made me feel that I returned the favor that other classmates had done for me."

SEC has three great pillars, but one that means the most to me is increasing engineering awareness. As a freshman, I came in wanting to do chemical engineering, but didn\u2019t understand why. I was introduced to Industry Night and after attending a presentation from Texas Instruments I learned that chemical engineering was one of the most diverse fields. Soon after, I attended DI Saturday, where I talked to two senior chemical engineers. One told me that she interned at Marathon and worked in the plant everyday, while the other said he was in a lab analyzing how food was processed. The diverse paths of both students made me realize that I could do anything with chemical engineering! After doing my own research and talking to different industry professionals, I found that I was interested in nanoparticle research and worked in a nanotechnology lab this summer. Industry Night and DI Saturday helped me understand what engineering was, and its real world applications. I believe that spreading engineering awareness is important for everyone to pursue their passions.",
            "Question 9": "I have been a bharatnatyam (Indian classical) dancer for 13 years of my life. It defined who I was as a person, teaching me hard work, dedication, and physical and mental discipline. After I completed my dance graduation, I didn\u2019t know how I would continue this art form after coming to college and getting into the hectic school routine, and on top of that, finding people with similar interests as me. After I came to A&M, I made it a goal to continue dancing, whether it be starting my own club, practicing on my own, or finding other avenues to continue. I did my research on the various clubs and found that we had a competitive Indian classical dance team, TAMU Sahithya - I auditioned and made the team. In that aspect, I was successful in continuing dance after my dance graduation and I was very content with how it was all playing out. As we traveled around the country in a big group of 14 girls for our different competitions, we often got asked a lot of questions from various people we met, \u201cWhat does your club do?\u201d, \u201cWhat form of dance?\u201d, \u201cHow is this dance different from other forms of dance?\u201d Something that seemed so simple to us was so intriguing to them, and we never realized that we were spreading knowledge about our culture.

            "Question 10": "Throughout my educational experiences, I have only had to work with people who are of my age and caliber, so I was never exposed to anything different. Everyone always contributed about the same level of knowledge to every assignment/ group project, so I was only applying the skills I already had. This summer, I had the opportunity to work alongside a graduate student in a nanotechnology lab. He had just given his dissertation presentation and I was given the job of performing the last experiments that were needed to defend his thesis. When I was suddenly put into this position, I felt that I needed to know just as much as him when it came to synthesizing the particles. I was stressed out when I didn\u2019t know the answer to questions he was asking me, and would rush to read the articles he sent me. As the days went on, instead of stressing out about not knowing something, I started to just soak in every word he was telling me, because every time he spoke, I was learning something new. This was one of the first times in an educational setting where my only job was to learn. Before, everyone contributed about the same, but now, I was only encouraged to learn - a dynamic that changes depending on who you\u2019re working with. This lab experience taught me how to consider other perspectives and how to approach working with different people.",
            "Question 11": "My high school was very competitive in every aspect: academics, sports, fine arts, etc. It was known that many people from my school didn\u2019t enjoy their time there because of the competition, and many people transferred to get away from it. As an NHS officer, it was my duty to serve. We did many service projects for other communities like cops, firefighters, janitors, but never our own students, so me and another officer took it upon ourselves to create a service project that was dedicated to the students of our high school. In May, mental health awareness month, me and eight other NHS officers put together about 500 care packages for our students. We filled gift bags with candy, stress balls, journals, and notes of encouragement. Then, put all the bags in the counselor's office and sent out a newsletter saying if anyone needed a \u201cpick-me-up\u201d they could stop by and pick up a care package. After two days all the packages were gone. We received several emails that the care packages helped them get through the day.

            "Question 8": "I feel that having a representative voice is my greatest interest of the three pillars. Coming into college, it was hard to feel like many people cared about what I had to say or my struggles. To ease these feelings, I joined a FLO with the hopes of making supportive friends. The FLO was marketed as an environment of growth through connections, though unfortunately I didn\u2019t feel they were personal. This was upsetting, but gave wherewithal to things I thought I could do better as a sophomore mentor. With my freshman experience in mind I made sure the new freshman I mentored felt they had someone looking out for them, often bringing up their ideas to fellow staff members. I understand this is a skill meant to be learned in college, to advocate for yourself, but being in this environment I created for my freshman accelerated their understanding of this and deepened my own ability in self advocacy. I feel engineers often find it hard to ask for help, so if I were to be in SEC I would focus on building personal bonds between fellow engineers along with monitoring the student body\u2019s opinions and advocating for change where needed.",
            "Question 9": "I define success as making the choice to be better than I was yesterday and exerting myself to my limit as often as I can within reason. When I was in high school I swam in both club and UIL leagues, where I practiced twice a day. Swimming is a unique sport due to it being entirely individual. This means you\u2019re not able to be successful without putting in your full effort, whereas in team sports you only have to be better than whoever you\u2019re facing that day. Every time I competed in meets I knew if I had tried my hardest immediately by looking up at the scoreboard and reading my time. Typically when I had failed to come close to my best it was due to failure to prepare for the meet. It could be a multitude of things that distracted me from my goal of being better, but I knew I had to set myself up throughout the month leading up to every meet if I wanted to be successful. I apply this definition to my schooling and professional life as well now, trying to set myself up for success by being better than I was yesterday through discipline in studying and networking. I know the consistency I\u2019ve developed through swimming is applicable to SEC and whatever role I may fill. I will always be improving myself everyday and in turn improving the college of engineering.",
            "Question 10": "During my senior year of high school my friend and I got super into smash bros, playing as often as we could. We knew others also liked the game, so to bring together all the players in the school we hosted a tournament. We kept it on school grounds due to easy access to screens and everyone already being on campus, which required us to follow the event rules laid out by the school. For any student run event there needed to be a Faculty sponsor, so we asked our favorite teacher Mr. Ryburn to fulfill this role and planned with him for when he was available certain days after school. The biggest problem we ran into was the gathering of screens into the multipurpose room. Certain teachers were given mobile screens as opposed to wall mounted screens, so we made sure to visit and obtain permission to use theirs\u2019. After a week of planning times out where all the screens were available, we settled on a Friday after school to host the tournament, which was a great success. This experience gave me insight into how communicative event organizers have to be to get anything done, which I found a new respect for. I know in SEC I can be this person and use my communication skills to contribute towards continuing success in the career fair as well as to expand upon ideas for Eweek, bringing together engineers into a tighter community.",
            "Question 11": "While I was a swimmer in middle school I understood that volunteers were the reason our meets were able to run so smoothly. I would often have to volunteer after my age session in the morning for my younger sisters in the afternoon session. Due to this experience volunteering I was asked to join my friend with volunteering at the special olympics. I took the opportunity to help out and showed up that next weekend as a lane timer. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect here as I had never worked with anyone who had special needs, but my worries quickly subsided when more experienced volunteers explained what we\u2019d be doing. The day went by fast as it was a lot of fun to see and interact with the athletes, always happy to talk to us. I always get a feeling of joy after volunteering due to the fact that I know I made a difference and that even If I\u2019m not personally thanked by other\u2019s I helped someone feel good. In SEC I know I\u2019ll feel the same through service to the college of engineering and other charitable events."

            "Question 8": "Of the three pillars, fostering the professional advancement of other engineers resonates with me the most. Texas A&M is known for its exceptional engineering program and every year thousands of new engineers are admitted. It is easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of people around you. Being an international student, I understand just how difficult it can be to find your professional path in a college with a population as big as A&M\u2019s. The career fairs helped me get my foot out the door as a sophomore and I am passionate about providing the same opportunities to others.\nNow that I am aware of the amount of work the SEC puts into these career fairs every single semester- coordinating with new and returning companies, organizing the event, and making the venue comfortable for the recruiters and students alike - I have developed a deep appreciation for their work. It would be immensely rewarding to become a part of the effort and help fellow engineers achieve their professional goals in a meaningful way.",
            "Question 9": "I took physics for two years in high school- AP Physics 1 and C. I barely passed on one AP exam and failed the other, which was extremely disappointing. When I entered my engineering program in sophomore year, I realized that I would need to take Physics 207- and I couldn\u2019t claim credit for it. Therefore, going into the second semester, I set a personal goal for myself: to make a B in that class. While I would have preferred an A, I knew that would\u2019ve been a stretch.\nWhen the semester started, my initial fears began to fade. I had a great professor, I put in the effort and got help when I needed to. I also made sure to attend every lecture. Since there was no homework, I studied regularly for the exams to stay consistent throughout and not fall behind.\nAt the end of the semester, after all my efforts, not only did I achieve my goal, I also surpassed it by earning an A. What once seemed unattainable became my reality because of my efforts. This experience taught me to not get intimidated by challenges, set realistic goals and work towards them without giving up.",
            "Question 10": "Being a woman engineer, my peers are naturally mostly men. During freshman year, I had to take Physics 216 which is a lab class. We worked in groups and I often found myself to be the only girl in a group of 3-4. It is human nature to gravitate towards something or someone that you feel a sense of familiarity with, so the men in the groups stuck together, leaving me out. Even still, I would make an effort to be just as involved in the lab. Even while working on the report, they would communicate with each other much more than they would with me.\nThis experience taught me the importance of being self-confident and diligent with your efforts. I will more likely than not, encounter similar situations in the real world where people will not naturally include me. When I do face them, I will not let them pull me down and doubt myself in my abilities. Instead, I will continue to prove that I belong there.",
            "Question 11": "In high school, I used to go to the food bank often with my family. We would make it a point to go volunteer once every two weeks. It would usually be during the weekends so my dad could come as well. It was physically demanding work because it would require us to move heavy items into boxes and then move the heavy boxes. Volunteering there helped me develop my team work skills since sometimes we would be divided in groups according to our physical abilities and we would have to adapt to working with strangers. It was extremely rewarding knowing that we were making a positive impact on so many people\u2019s lives. This sense of fulfillment has stayed with me and I will continue to serve others when I can."

            "Question 8": "Providing for the professional advancement of Texas A&M Engineering students means the most to me. As a Fish Camp counselor, I worked closely with the incoming freshmen who were eager but often very uncertain about their future. Most had no clear idea where they wanted to go, how to get there, and which of the over 20 engineering majors to choose from. Ironically, I didn't zero in on how to do this until one of my cabin boys talked to me about his career as a cybersecurity analyst with HEB and all the crazy other networking things he did to get to where he is now. All it took to get the ball rolling was somebody giving me their time to teach me how to network, properly make a resume, and believe in my potential. While I still have plenty of room to advance in my career, I want to be this initial push for others and a pool of knowledge so they can get their footing and start their journey.",
            "Question 9": "In the past, I set a personal goal to overcome social anxiety to the point where it didn't exist. TLDR, I did. I knew this wouldn't happen overnight, so to me, success was making consistent, measurable progress toward my goal. Success wasn't about a cure but about gradually chipping away at it through purposeful effort and exposure. To do this, I intentionally threw myself into situations that needed me to leave my comfort zone. From starting small conversations with classmates, striking up conversations with cashiers, and later taking roles that required me to speak in front of hundreds. Each step outside of my comfort zone was winning on its own. I measured success by the little improvements I hardly noticed: I didn't apologize for stuttering then, I spoke confidently during that presentation, and I could even initiate a conversation without planning or hesitation. These incremental achievements were much more rewarding because they reflected the hard work and persistence I put into overcoming my anxiety. They also gave me a ladder to climb instead of a mountain. I still use this approach to set goals, from increasing my daily workout volume to self-teaching data structures and algorithms and professional networking with recruiters. I hope that by using this approach, I will meet any goals I set for myself through SEC.",
            "Question 10": "This past summer, I worked on developing a nutrition app startup focused on finding places to eat different restrictive diets since most information is not easily accessible. Our small team of three combined many diverse skills and was initially united by a shared vision. As we progressed throughout development, one member tasked with marketing and content creation began to undermine decisions, dismiss ideas, and show a general lack of effort. The member found that his interests lay more in taking our only camera to his friend's lake house to film videos of waterskiing than meeting deadlines established in meetings. Despite attempts to address these issues through open communication, the member continued to show a lack of care, which affected the morale and productivity of our other member and I. Meetings became strained, and our project's momentum stalled. After a difficult decision to remove the problematic member from our team, I had to decide to pause development until this December so we could truly focus on the reason we were making the app. This experience taught me the considerable influence even one person's attitude can have on group dynamics. It showed how important it is to address interpersonal issues head-on and foster a positive, respectful environment. I learned that technical skills aren't the only ingredients to make a team work. Moving forward, I prioritize team members' expertise and genuine passion for the team's values and goals. I also",
            "Question 11": "Volunteering at St. Joseph's taught me the true impact of simply being there for people who need to be heard. One evening, when my shift had just finished, I noticed a young woman sitting alone in the waiting area. Her eyes were red from crying, and she looked overwhelmed and scared. Instead of going to get home to study, I sat next to her and gently asked if she would like to talk. She began to share her strained relationship with her foster parents, which she was too afraid to tell that she was not feeling well for fear of them lashing out. As she spoke, I listened and offered words of reassurance when I needed to. At that moment, I wasn't there to help solve her problems but to give her a compassionate presence in a stressful time. Our conversation lasted only about 15 minutes, but in the end, she seemed calmer. She thanked me for taking the time to listen, which made her feel less alone. This interaction highlighted that sometimes the most significant help I can offer doesn't involve solutions or some innovative fix but being present and genuinely listening to the needs of others."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that means the most to me is Engineering Awareness. Trying to spread recognition and encouragement for engineering is very important in continuing to grow and foster interest with all different kinds of people. Whether it\u2019s through students currently enrolled in engineering or those thinking that is what they might want to study, I think making people feel like they are or would be welcome and appreciated as an engineers is integral in contributing to a diverse student community. In addition, there is the philanthropy side of engineering awareness. Having events where SEC gives back to the community is a great way to involve aggies in something to help them grow as people as well as engineers. I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and become a better person and engineer. Hence, the engineering awareness pillar is what I feel would encourage not only me but all current and future engineers.",
            "Question 9": "When I first got to Texas A&M, success for me was getting an A in every class no matter what. Of course, this is a goal that every student has with high hopes, but for me, this definition of success turned out to be more harmful than helpful. When my class results weren\u2019t up to par with what I wanted I felt frustrated and overwhelmed. It felt like the work I was putting into class wasn\u2019t paying off. I had hit a roadblock. It took a while for me to take a step back and realize that grades are important, but what is more important is taking the time to learn the content and truly understand it. Constantly overthinking and being overly critical of myself had proven to be a toxic way of defining success. Once I had taken the time to thoroughly understand class work and not put so much pressure on myself I ended up succeeding more than I had before. This showed me that in college success looks different for everyone, and what matters most is putting your all into your work.",
            "Question 10": "When working in groups in the past, the normal course of action was to split up the work per person and come together and glue the pieces together. When I was first assigned group work here at A&M, it didn\u2019t take long to realize that the method I had been so used to would not be nearly as effective at this level. Spring semester of my sophomore year I was assigned a team design project that altered my view of group work completely. Throughout this project, I learned just how important communication, collaboration, and voicing opinions are to effective group work. Even if the team had different roles, coming together to help each other, listen to what others had to say, and create a result that was cohesive and representative of the team, was integral to success. This experience thoroughly shaped the way I take on working with others inside and outside of the classroom.",
            "Question 11": "In the summers of 2021 and 2022, I was able to volunteer at First United Methodist Church of McKinney and assist a children's Music and Arts camp. This week-long experience was devoted to strengthening the children's knowledge of their faith through learning and performing a musical and creating crafts. I assisted in the facilitation of the activities, teaching the children music and choreography, and accommodating children with special needs. Being able to participate in this event twice taught me a lot as I had never worked with kids before. I was able to grow skills such as patience, efficient planning and organizing, and how to be inclusive. I was grateful to serve my community and contribute to a creative and fun experience that hopefully aided in the growth of the children's faith and appreciation of fine arts."

            "Question 8": "While all three pillars are crucial, the one that resonates the most with me is the professional advancement pillar. An early start to professional development can set a strong foundation for engineering undergraduate students.\nIn freshman year, having a great understanding of different industries will help engineers ETAM into the major right for them. SEC provides many opportunities such as DI Saturday and Industry Night, which helped me choose chemical engineering. I hope all students can be able to find a match that fits their skills and interests.\nTo get an internship, students must have good professional skills which are easily accessible through the SEC. These skills could be developed through working on elevator speeches, resumes, and networking. A crucial thing is having mentors that make it easy to start. Personally, I used to be very nervous talking with recruiters, but I attended the AIChE sophomore retreat where I had mentors my age. They taught me important skills regarding professional development and now I am very comfortable with networking. I want to be devoted to mentoring all students to improve their professional development skills to gain the confidence that will create a ripple effect throughout their daily and professional lives.",
            "Question 9": "Failure is an inevitable part of the engineering undergraduate experience. It is how you recover that sets you apart from others. In Spring 2024 I failed my first class Calculus III which, to me was a bad way to end my sophomore year. Knowing I\u2019d have to retake the whole class over a couple of points was the worst part.\nTalking with my parents, I was inspired me to take a positive spin on it. I decided I was going to stay in College Station for the whole summer and catch up in my classes. I set the goal to leverage the summer as a period of personal and professional growth. Along with Calculus III, I also took Differential Equations and Thermodynamics. Although the 5 week courses were difficult, I persisted. Research was something else I wanted to do with my time at College Station. Wanting to go into the oil and gas industry while also being passionate about sustainability, I started research in Biofuels under Dr. Holtzapple. In doing so I spent around 6 hours in the lab every week, tending to the fermentation batches. It was a great experience that I will be continuing this fall. I also picked up a job at the ILSQ as a Stockroom assistant for 12 hours a week. Balancing late nights at Evans and Zachary studying, with early mornings spent on research and work, although challenging, was fulfilling as I was dedicated to my growth.",
            "Question 10": "Working as a team is a skill that takes practice. You have to be able to share your thoughts while also being open to ideas. It takes good communication between all parties. In my CHEN-201 class, our final project was to build a bottle rocket. The tricky part was that none of the supporting materials needed to complete the project such as Inventor, Excel, Python, and 3D printing were taught to us. The team wanted to put it off until closer to the deadline, but we stepped up as we needed to get it done before finals. Even though we were not taught the material, we were able to divide the work based on our past experience and skills. In doing so, we were able to get the project done promptly and successfully. Hence, giving us more time to study for finals.\nThis is just one example of working on a team successfully. At Texas A&M, we are given many opportunities to practice being on a team without even knowing it, which I think is detrimental to our success in industry, especially engineering. We are on teams in our PHYS/ENGR labs, CHEM labs, undergrad research, and on-campus jobs. I think it is important to take advantage of this time in college to perfect working on a team and collaborating, as it is one of the most important skills in our professional careers as engineers.",
            "Question 11": "Community service is a way to serve others. Throughout highschool, I was dedicated to the Boy Scouts of America where I did most of my Community Service experience including park cleanups, blood drives, and BOPA cleanups. My Eagle Scout project included organizing scouts to refurbish old benches and make new picnic tables for my elementary school. In doing so I was able to organize people to complete the project which took over 300 cumulative hours. This opportunity allowed me to give back to the community that helped me become the person I am today. Joining the SEC would allow me to pick up where I left off and continue doing service for those around me. I enjoy working on a team, and even if it is strenuous work, I enjoy having those experiences with people around me to build a community.\nBesides community service, joining SEC will allow me to become a mentor for younger students to look to. I\u2019ve had many experiences including on-campus jobs, undergraduate research, clubs, and taking too many hours. This exposure will allow me to serve the students by providing advice on how to balance it all while working to become a successful engineering student."

Through my time in a FLO, FEST, I received marketing and merchandise creation opportunities and a sense of community amongst older and freshmen engineers. One benefit of FEST was the research workshop hosted. I learned how to properly prepare a professional resume and to reach out to professors for lab positions. Although I contacted several professors, I received only one interview for a lab. Unfortunately, I was not selected, but the prospective opportunity made me ambitious to work on my career to improve my chances in the future. Having the privilege to attend the SEC career fair this semester with the experience of a mock career fair that FEST organized; made me more confident in my professional capabilities. Following the fair, I made it past the first round interview with the company Lubrizol and am now waiting for round two of the hiring process for a co-op internship opportunity.

However, I feel that being a person who tries to improve himself and be a better person every day makes me successful. Having this perspective did not come without challenge \u2013 I lacked optimism in my adolescence due to issues with familial abuse and weight struggles. Because of these factors, I put my energy into things I could control, such as my education. Being studious while dealing with instability had been one of my greatest difficulties growing up. No one in my family has gone to college, so to be the first person in my family to surpass that given my challenges has made me feel as though any obstacle that will ever occur can be overcome. With newfound confidence in myself, I was able to work on my weight. Knowing that I went from weighing 260 pounds to 165 pounds is still hard for me to process. Being proactive with my health today and continuing my college education has made me feel and truly be successful, marked by the optimism that I now embody.",
            "Question 10": "Before taking ENGR 102, I had lacked group projects in high school that required me to collaborate with a team. Relatively quickly, I had become comfortable with the group delegating parts of the project and assumed everyone could do their part. However, in my group for ENGR 102, I was the only one with coding experience, though it was extremely minimal. The first few projects before the course material got challenging had been easy to coordinate, but once the fifth week happened, problems occurred as a team. One of our teammates would stop responding in our group chat for our team projects, except 30 minutes before it was due, only to ask for the code. We had all become friends as the semester continued, so it was difficult to set boundaries without risking the relationships that had been built. The first action everyone in our group agreed with was to tell our teammate about their lack of contribution. Without escalating the issue, they expressed that they had been busy with exams and other ongoing issues. This was hard for me to accept, given that during the semester my house flooded and I had my own issues going on as well. However, my teammates and I still decided to work together and supported our other teammates. I realized that this was a result of our lack of established boundaries or communication of expectations. To prevent this issue again, I have learned to set boundaries and expectations with groups from the start.",

Thus, I look at three main things when I set goals for myself: long term milestones, short term milestones, and results. By looking at long term milestones for my goal, I can keep track of all the progress that I can make to achieve my goal. Short term goals allow me to stay consistent to my long term goal and allow me to monitor the progress I make to achieve it. It also allows me to reflect on my personal growth and how I can better myself as a person. Lastly, results allow the reflection of my goal panned out in an overarching scheme. I can truly annalize how my goal either helped me personally grow or assess how it was used to help others. Thus, I don\u2019t measure success on whether the goal meets its intended purpose. I view it as an experience that betters myself and a group.",
            "Question 10": "When I was younger, I always preferred working alone. However, during a recent internship with SLB Engineering, my perspective on group work changed significantly. Initially, my days were spent primarily in the lab with technicians, learning to operate machinery for testing polymers. This experience involved an abundance of individual tasks like operating equipment, collecting data, and analyzing results which lacked the collaborative elements of a corporate job that I had imagined. This experience made me value the importance of group work. I came to appreciate that collaboration fosters the exchange of diverse ideas that allow me to learn from a multitude of perspectives and offers a social outlet to meet more people. As a result, I now prefer working with others, valuing the shared perspectives and collective creativity that teamwork provides.",
            "Question 11": "I truly believe that the best quality a person can have is the ability to make a positive impact on another person's life. Reflecting on my experiences, I remember of my time as an officer for a volunteering organization where I proposed and led a toy drive for Texas Children\u2019s Hospital as part of my passion project. I presented the idea to our chapter\u2019s advisers and worked with the hospital\u2019s volunteering coordinator. To market the drive, I presented it to students as an incentive to get volunteering hours. Within just two weeks, we were able to collect over 100 toys to donate to children in the hospital. The experience taught me about communication, organization, and marketing. While tedious, seeing the fruits of our efforts made the process rewarding. I was presented with another opportunity to serve people through volunteering at my local taekwondo studio as a Certified Taekwondo Instructor. I was able to interact and build relationships with students by providing small group instruction and improving collaboration through encouraging participation from shyer students. Taekwondo gave me the ability to express myself and empathize with people. Both experiences have shown me the profound impact of service and personal connection."

            "Question 8": "While I fully support all three pillars from the SEC Mission Statement, I identify myself with the mission of being the representative voice of the engineering student body that SEC strives to serve. Having spent my freshman year at Texas A&M University at Galveston, I was disappointed at the lack of representation for the student engineering body, who made up almost half of the campus population, at the Galveston campus. Although engineering student organizations existed, there were only a few and all of them tends to target a specific demographic. I have heard rumors of past engineering organizations on the campus, and even witnessed a rise of the Galveston Engineering Student Organization established by close friends of mine in Spring 2023, the limited funding and support means that organizations struggled to engage students. My experience at the Galveston Campus is the main reason why I believe in the importance of the SEC's mission to be the representative voice for engineering students; for a community that takes up almost half of the student body, there must be a powerful voice that represents them.",
            "Question 9": "My definition of success is based on my satisfaction with the performance rather than just doing more than the minimum. I believe that the effort put into achieving something is more significant than simply crossing the finish line. This past summer (Summer 2024) I set myself to improve in running as it is important for me to not just perform well in Corps physical training but also to increase my cardiovascular performance overall. I made a plan to run at least 3 times a week, varying the pace and distance each time\nI started off really well during May 2024 with each week running more times than I have set myself, but as time gone by after the July 4th holidays, I struggled to even run 1 or 2 times a week. At the conclusion of summer, while I was pleased with my running consistency, I was disappointed with my pace which only increased by roughly 0.5 minutes per mile in a 3-months span. I felt my success was limited because, although I did improved in running, my improvement felt short of what I had envisioned.",
            "Question 10": "I'm glad to say that I have a lot of experience working with others, and this June I had the opportunity to serve as a camp counselor for the Aerospace Engineering Department's Camp SOAR. My role involved collaborating with other counsellors and engaging with high school students in exploring space and flight research at Texas A&M University.\nDuring a campus tour that two colleagues and I were leading a campus tour, we had a different in approach. Because of my experience with the Corps of Cadets, I felt it was important to make extended stops at important sites on campus to explain the history. However, my colleagues had a different take and only made longer stops at engineering complexes such as the Zachry building. After that tour, I felt a sense of disconnect because despite having the same positions, each of us had our own interest.\nThat moment reminded me of a quote I recalled: \"There are no foes or friends, only people with different interests.\" Even when working with close friends or colleagues, people value individuality, and it's important to effectively communicate to bridge differences.",
            "Question 11": "This past August, I had the honor of serving as a peer mentor for the 2024 VIP (Virtual introduction to Python) Bootcamp, hosted by the College of Engineering's Student Engagement for Academic Success (SEAS). This position required me to engage with incoming first-generation freshmen and helped them learn early content of ENGR 102 before the school year starts.\nOver 14 days of working for the camp, I took responsibility over four freshmen and maintained communication with them through Discord and Zoom. Each night before lecture, I took an hour to completing the Zybook assignments to better understand what the students were going through. Although I am required to have two hours of daily \"study jam\" sessions where the student can ask questions, throughout the day and even on weekends, I answer any questions concerning Zybook and Python. By the end of the camp, I felt not only that I have contributed to the growth of the mentees, but also that I had helped the faculty achieve the objectives of the camp."

            "Question 8": "I think the pillar of the SEC mission statement that means the most to me is engineering awareness. Coming from a family of non-engineers, I had little knowledge of engineering itself and what was involved in the profession. As an organization, SEC offers so many opportunities for individuals to be exposed to many different activities and aid that allows advancement in our profession as well as growth as people. Engineering awareness means the most since I know there is an organization that wants to help me and provide resources for me to make the most out of myself. As an SEC member, I would want to give that opportunity to other engineers and teach them about the endless possibilities they have through all the events SEC provides for them.",
            "Question 9": "One of the biggest goals I feel like I set for myself and completed was graduating high school a year early. All my life I have wanted to go to Texas A&M, and I did not want graduating high school early to hinder that. I felt ready for college, so I worked harder than I ever had and pushed myself to still get the grades I needed to reach my goal of graduating early and getting into A&M. It was not an easy process, but I continuously poured my time and effort into this task. I studied, took hard classes to prepare me for university, participated in extracurriculars, and was a normal high school senior. At the end of my senior year, I was ranked number 1 in my class, while graduating high school in 3 years, and got accepted into the engineering department at my dream school. In the end, all my hard work paid off. I exceeded the goal I had placed on myself, which I defined as a success since the outcome was the result I desired.",
            "Question 10": "As the ambassador for our Chick-Fil-A Leader Academy in high school, I had the opportunity to work with a team to serve our community. In this, we held a variety of different projects, which included hosting a hygiene drive and donating the products to a local homeless shelter, and starting a \u201cBear Buddy\u201d program, where we would go and read books to the kindergarten kids. This really helped me learn how to collaborate with a group of people come together and work as one to accomplish a goal. A large part of life in general is teamwork and communication, as well as time management, and this position helped combine all those aspects and teach me the importance of being a leader. In all of our activities, we had to split into groups and determine who would do what, the best way to tackle the problem, etc. So through this, I was able to understand what teamwork really was and trust my colleagues with their tasks. I am no stranger to dedicating my time and energy to something for a long time, and this position taught me the value of listening and hearing all perspectives to work cohesively with a group of people to complete a task. My perspective shifted to where I was focused less on trying to get the job done, and I legitimately wanted to hear the ideas of the team and reach the goal together.",
            "Question 11": "I was on the youth leadership team at my church, where we helped plan various activities, such as the junior high retreat. We also served in the church Sunday mornings helping out with childcare or hospitality. Through the service team at my church, I was given the opportunity to help so many people and make their days so much better. I loved seeing someone's entire mood brighten when they got a warm cup of coffee on a cold Sunday morning. I loved getting to see kids I had been with get excited about the games we created for their retreats. It was a very rewarding feeling to know I was making the people around me smile just by being consistent with my time and making their day a little better."

            "Question 9": "I graduated highschool in the top 6% of my class. However, I came to realize that recieving the honor was not the success itself but the process I learned along the way. I struggled with my gpa and time management throughout highschool. Junior year, I wasn't getting enough sleep, I burnt myself out with homework and dance hour commitments, and struggled with time management. This inconsistent pattern of sleep,physical activity, and poor health habits unfortunatly contributed to the iron deficieny anemia. I had to quit the dance team as well as the orchestra. At the end of the semester my health was getting better but my grades were still low. Senior year, I told myself that I had to get into the top 10% of my class to get into A&M. I re-joined the dance team, orchestra, as well as different organizations. I learned the importance of health as well as time management. Throughout the year, I developed a consistent pattern for my daily schedule. By the time I applied, I was in the top 8% of my class and graduated in the top 6%. The success in this achievement was not in the achievement itself, but in the process I had learned along the way. I learned how to have better study habits, I learned that my health is my number one priority, and I learned the importance of balance and time management. This learning process allowed me to grow as a person and redefine my terminology of success.",
            "Question 10": "Growing up, I had always been the kid that preferred to work by themselves. With group projects throughout school, I would always think I would have a better time if I \"worked on it on my own\". This perspective changed my sophomore year of high school. In my sophomore year, I applied for a spirit leader position for the varsity dance/drill team at my school. I was honored to be chosen as one of the 3 spirit leaders on the team. Throughout the year we learned what it means to be a servant leader, to lead by service and influence. This role was fufilled by working together by collaborating and respecting each other. The most beneficial lesson I learned from leading with these ladies was that we as individuals expand our knowledge through the ideas and creativity shared with others. This role allowed me to become open minded because it allowed me to see how one single thought can be expanded by the creativity of others to create an impact that will help society. We grow as individuals by gaining the ideas of new perspectives, and I learned that we can only do this by working and collaborating with others.",
            "Question 11": "In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and started a trajedic war. My friends and I couldn't even imagine what the families, civilians, and children were facing, this is why we decieded to start a Nonprofit Organization called Upcycling for Ukraine. To provide help for the citizens of Ukraine, In April 2022, I helped to lead a group of 5 members to create upcycled clothing. Our team\u2019s goal was to use our creativity to help those in need. We accomplished this by upcycling clothing and selling them on an instagram account. We collected clothes that our group members and classmates wanted to get rid of and upcycled them by washing, cutting, painting, and redesigning the clothes in a way to be able to sell them new and improved. With our group of five members, in four months we were able to make $190 total! We donated our total profit of $190 to a Ukrainian relief program through UNHCR. The UNHCR (The UN refugee agency) provides emergency supplies, shelter, care, and hope to families fleeing violence.\nInstagram account: @uu_expo"

Community outreach and planning events has always been the most fulfilling thing to do as a college student. I was Involved in the AIChE external committee and I present during career day at elementary schools in my home town to encourage students to pursue engineering or STEM fields; Seeing the excitement that comes from the challenges that we built and having children or older students complete them with enthusiasm really makes the time commitment seem minute.",
            "Question 9": "Defining success in a goal generally means that you have not only done your best in completing the goal but you also grew and defied your expectations. For example, one of my most recent goals was simply to complete my internship project for my company. While doing this however, I found myself networking with other teams in the company, such as IT, Accounting and Finance, reaching out to our operations team, going out into the plant, and collaborating with multiple engineering teams to create a project that I was not only proud of, but served a greater purpose than simply just completing an assignment. I was able to grow my confidence in working at a plant, but also learned how to be an important asset of a team. Looking back on my experience, the assignment quickly became more than just a project but something that highlighted my strengths and pushed me to become more people oriented and precise in my technical applications. I have grown as both a professional engineer and as a person.",
            "Question 10": "I was taking a Safety Engineering course and we had random group assignments for our class semester project. None of my other group members were chemical engineers but the class was heavily focused on process events that either occur in chemical processing or oil/gas. Our project was centered around a report that was to explain the Piper Alpha off-shore incident. My group members were petroleum and architectural engineering majors with no prior knowledge of gas or oil processing; We all came at the project from a variety of perspectives: focusing on asset integrity, structure, fluid composition, and instrumentation failures. I realized that although they did not have the same technical scope that I did, I was able to learn from their perspectives on aspects of the project that I had not considered before. This experience made me realize that we can learn something from everyone that we work with, regardless of technical or personal perspective. This has made me accept any learning opportunity from everyone that I meet both in industry and in the academic setting.",
            "Question 11": "I frequently volunteer at schools from my hometown; presenting and helping teachers around the classroom. Helping with classwork, enrichment, presentations on career day, and aiding schools is extremely rewarding to me. Giving back to a community that I feel has raised me to be the person and student that I am today makes me hopeful for the next generation of students. Helping teachers get their students excited about learning and the opportunities that come with an education is extremely important to emphasize. Seeing the teachers and students enthusiastic about me helping out makes volunteering extremely fulfilling. Helping schools, especially when educators are in short supply, makes the more experience so much more rewarding and appreciative."

            "Question 8": "From the mission statement, the fostering of professional advancement (Development) means the most to me largely because it's the most valuable part of attending engineering school here at TAMU. Most, if not all, engineering students chose to pursue their higher-education here because of the highly regarded Aggie network and a large part of that is fostered by the continued efforts of the SEC to connect students with employers for internship/co-op/job opportunities as well as generally improving their professional skills, whether that be through the Career Fair or workshops.",
            "Question 9": "The best way I have found to define success (regarding some arbitrary goal) is to ensure that you not only achieve that goal, but that you also learn a new skill or improve upon your current skills in the process. For example, during my freshman year here at TAMU, I was laser focused on ensuring my ability to gain auto-admission into my first choice major at the time, which was Aerospace Engineering. During that time, I understood that if I wanted that major to avoid the gamble that is ETAM without auto-admission, I had to aim for straight A's that entire academic year. This entailed a complete overhaul of my personal studying habits at that time and by the end of my freshman year, once ETAM decisions were released, I realized that I had done a lot more than ensure auto-admission. I had essentially bootstrapped my planning skills and academic discipline just for this one goal, which I felt was a greater success than just getting the major I wanted. For any goal, long term or short term, it was clear to my that I can easily define success through what I learned and improved upon in the process, not just the process itself.",
            "Question 10": "Back in high school, I was part of a highly competitive marching band as both one of the leading musicians and student leaders (drill instructor and section leader). That experience left a distinct impact on how I work with and interact with others, largely from an interpersonal perspective- I learned how to not only lead in the most basic sense, but also how to delegate, resolve conflicts, and invest in those I lead, all while remaining fully accountable and open to criticism. Frankly, this was only possible because I was lucky enough to have several world-class band directors and fellow student leaders to bounce ideas off of (in regards to working with others), which I am truly grateful to have worked with. If I were to pick a single aspect of this experience that impacted me the most, it was the idea that no matter how small, continuous and incremental improvements by everyone involved is the best recipe for team success rather than banking off the skills and improvements of a singular person or a subset within the team- in other words, everyone involved matters, no matter how small their contribution.",
            "Question 11": "During my internship with AMD this past summer, the company sponsored/hosted several volunteering events of which I attended. One of these events was a self-hosted event (i.e. at the company campus) in partnership with a summer school program for aspiring first-generation students just entering high school. During this event, we helped the kids build and race solar powered race cars in multiple different teams. It was during this event that I came to understand not only how a new, younger generation of students approached engineering, but also how their background as first-generation students impacted their perspective on academics as a whole. As someone who wasn't a first-generation student, it was a good exercise in broadening my own perspective as well as just working with others who have a different perspective."

            "Question 8": "Professional advancement is the most meaningful pillar from the SEC Mission Statement to me because it allows for development within all aspects of the engineering industry. Through professional advancement, individuals are required to deeply think, innovate, and actively prosper every day. This pillar acts as a personal responsibility for each engineer to strive for greatness. To me, this is important because individual advancements result in learning opportunities for the rest of the field. It opens up the possibility to more research and new ideas. As a result, the other two pillars of the SEC Mission Statement are met. Personally, I believe that professional advancement is grasped for by doing service to oneself as well as others. As engineers create new innovations, they reach a wider audience that can become influenced by engineering. While doing service to oneself, engineers allow for their unique ideas and experiences to be shared; this allows for a more representative voice. The pillar that means the most to me encompasses the Mission Statement as a whole because it attempts to diversify the population of engineers and increase the impact of engineering on the world.",
            "Question 9": "In high school, I decided that taking precalculus over the summer was a great idea. I went through that class not retaining an ounce of information causing me to enter AP Calculus Ab with zero knowledge in that subject area. I struggled for every second in that class; I would go to sleep doing calculus homework and wake up at five in the morning to study more. I ended up getting a tutor and managed to end the class with a mid B which was an outlier for my average grades. In college, I was determined to do better in my calculus courses as an engineer. During calculus one, I made sure to not only be able to solve the problems I was given, but to also deeply understand it for the sake of my future courses. Success that semester was not centered around the fact that I got an A in Calculus One, but it was that I felt confident going into Calculus Two and Calculus Three. I am now taking high level math courses such as Linear Algebra and Differential Equations where I am no longer scared of complex math. In this situation and many others, I always try to think outside of the obvious end goal. Instead, I\u2019ve learned to give attention to all the future implications one decision may have. This has changed my college experience and I have become much more efficient and happy with the progress I have made in my professional life.",
            "Question 10": "My most rewarding experiences came from participating in Big Event.

While working, we learned about their incredible life stories\u2013 she, a journalist who fearlessly reported from dangerous locations such as oil rigs, and he, a project manager for the Texas A&M Health Science Building. Their gratitude for our help was heartwarming, and they generously shared stories from their travels, giving us a tour of their home filled with memories and antiques. Beyond that day, we\u2019ve stayed in touch and even had dinner together where we were able to enjoy produce from the garden that we helped plant. I\u2019ve gained invaluable career advice from both of them, and have shared personal stories with them that gives them an insight into my college life. Through this experience, I was able to learn that introducing yourself to unique relationships can give you an insight into a world you may never have known about.",
            "Question 11": "In the past, I participated in a program where I went to the local elementary school to directly work with one student who has been struggling academically and socially. My student, a second grader, had already hit multiple students two months into the school year. I worked with him to figure out why he feels he has to do that which caused him to open up to me about his life at home. He did not have a close relationship with his parents and he felt as though when he gets upset, there is nothing else he can do to get his emotions out. Throughout the year, I helped him turn those angry emotions into words and he eventually stopped hitting his classmates. In our downtime, I would play two player computer games with him, specifically Fireboy and Watergirl, a game that I cherished in my childhood. After a couple weeks of playing this game, he told me that he and his mom played it over the weekend. I was so proud that I was able to give this eight year old an opportunity to bond with his mom and learn how to control his feelings."

            "Question 9": "I was home alone frequently throughout my middle school and early high school years due to my parents\u2019 working and traveling. I would get home from school before they returned from work during the week, and on the weekends, they would leave the house before I woke up. My isolation at home induced extreme boredom. I played video games and ate junk food all day, every day. The poor habits I exercised soon caught up to me, and I felt lethargic and miserable without the physical activity and healthy foods that my body craved.\nEventually, I decided that I had had enough of feeling miserable and that I was going to make amends with my body. After little research, I concluded that running would be the quickest and most effective way to get in shape. Right then and there, I promised myself that I would run laps around my neighborhood every morning and put an end to my physical and mental withering.\nReluctantly yet consistently, I went out for my runs and reduced the amount of junk food I consumed. The Texas heat and humidity melted all the body fat I had, and I saw the changes that I hoped to see after just weeks.\nI accomplished the goal that I had set for myself, and my new, positive practices persisted.

My guarantee held true, and my team and I resolved the problem and reattached the lifting mechanism and motor. The robot operators went on to win us place second in the competition.\nEveryone in the team held a position attributed to their strengths. I was a strong leader, capable of settling inflamed situations, and technically effective, so I was the mechanical lead. My mechanical team members were more mechanically inclined than I was, so their primary responsibility was the construction and maintenance of the robot. The robot operators had keen communication skills and knew the season\u2019s game better than anyone else, so they were the ones holding the controllers. I learned that every person\u2019s role was given to them for a reason, and trusting each member to excel in their role is essential to team success.",
            "Question 11": "In the summer preceding my freshman year of college, I worked as a lifeguard at my gym\u2019s pool. My typical responsibilities included scanning the pool to ensure all patrons were safe and maintenance of the pool. However, one day, my skill set as a lifeguard was broadened when my boss, the aquatics director fell ill. I was the most senior lifeguard working that day, so I stepped up to fulfill the role after my boss left.\nI stepped off the lifeguard stand and headed into the office, turning my summer job into a desk job. I picked up where my boss left off, answering emails and phone calls regarding not only general pool questions, but also swimming lesson and summer camp queries, two large parts of the aquatics program that I knew nothing about. I got through the day one customer interaction at a time.\nI served not only the gym\u2019s customers, but also the aquatics director, by taking on a responsibility that I did not anticipate that day. I felt prideful and accomplished that I was able to successfully handle the unexpected challenge and support my team of coworkers in a time of need."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that means the most to me is to be the representative voice of all engineering students. There are many students in the college for engineering so it can be difficult to account for everybody, but that does not mean that we should not try. As an engineering student I was nervous about trying to network, about balancing all the classes on a new campus, and also about deciding what my major would be. Every student has worked hard and deserves to be heard and helped as much as possible. Engineer\u2019s Week really helped me feel like I was cared for and I loved that there were people looking out for all us engineering students, especially since they were fellow students who knew the struggles and what I might be going through. I would love to be a part of that and help other engineering students who might be overwhelmed or stressed, or to be a part of the legislation and be able to hear and fully represent what the students want or need.",
            "Question 9": "I have defined success as me not only accomplishing the goal I set for myself but also doing it in a way I was proud of. I have always been taught that you have to work for the things you want and to not give up. Sometimes people can reach their goals through \u201cshortcuts\u201d like cheating or putting others down to make themselves look good, and, although their goal has been achieved, this is not seen as a success to me. I can only see it as a success when it is achieved because you did your best, worked hard, and deserve it. I have always strived to do well in class and in exams, and even if I was not properly prepared or did not know the answer on a test or quiz, I never turned to cheating like trying to sneak notes or answers into class, because even if I failed it would not be worth it or deserved. I have always believed that there is no point in winning or being the best at something if you cannot be proud of it or how you got there.",
            "Question 10": "During the summer I worked at Six Flags as a Lead Rides Operator and worked with my fellow leadership members to make sure everything got done for the day and ran smoothly. There was one day where we were really short staffed, and people were running late so I was having trouble opening everything up on time. I contacted my co-lead and asked if she could send anyone to help and contacted my supervisor to see what we could do. My fellow coworker and supervisor came down to also help me and talk about what we could do. Once they came, we were able to talk and figure out a plan for the rest of the day. This experience showed me how important it is to rely on others and to communicate what's going on and if you need help. I really appreciated how my coworkers talked with me, listened and did their best to help me. There is no shame in admitting that you need help and having even just one person there to help can be enough. It is important to listen to others and be respectful and as helpful as you can, and to remember that everyone in the group has the same goal in mind. Since then, I have always done my best to be as understanding as I can and help people I am working with if they need help, and to not be afraid or too proud to ask for help.",
            "Question 11": "I was part of the Big Event last year and worked on an older couple\u2019s front yard, trimming, weeding, and adding new mulch. There were four of us and we worked as a team, so we were able to complete the task much faster than had it just been the two of them. I loved it and it made me feel great to help these people and make their front yard beautiful and well kept. When I was in high school I also tutored some of my friends in math, helping them with homework or through certain topics. I would help them during our free period and would sometimes try to teach it in a different way than our teacher to help them understand. It brought me so much joy when they finally got the topic and to see them get so excited when they got the problem right. I hope to continue serving others through SEC in some of the great events they offer to help people across the Bryan-College Station area."

            "Question 8": "Out of the three pillars, increasing engineering awareness means the most to me. When I look back to when I was a child, my father worked on electric vehicles and with engineers from all the way to China and India, he inspired me to become an engineer. Seeing him work day in and day out on complex devices, I saw how much labor and effort went into bringing these technologies to life. As I have grown older, I have realized just how much I have taken engineering for granted in my daily life. From the energy generators that power College Station to the semiconductors inside my laptop, it is easy to forget that behind these things are many hours of hard work and collaboration of engineers. Their contributions are often invisible, but their impact is everywhere. I believe that if more people understood the work behind these innovations, they would be more inspired to support careers in engineering. I would like to give others the opportunity to learn more about engineers and hopefully inspire them to become one themselves.",
            "Question 9": "The first summer I spent in Texas after moving here, I helped my father design the blueprints for my mother's dream backyard. We envisioned a brick patio, several canopies with hanging vines, a garden full of her favorite plants, and pond full of lotuses. My goal was to make progress on this every day in order to help make her dream come true. This goal strengthened the bond of my family's relationship and helped me to grow in several ways as well. The memory of my father and me excavating and laying the foundations for the bricks whether soaked from the rain or exhausted from the heat left a lasting impact on me. It showed me the hard work required to achieve one's goals and that every task, no matter how small brings one closer to the feeling of success. In addition to the physical differences we made to our backyard, the lasting legacy that comes to me whenever I play with my dogs in the backyard or help my mother to water her garden brings me immense personal satisfaction. The meticulous planning\nand effort I poured into making one of her dreams come true also made me feel fulfilled in accomplishing this goal",
            "Question 10": "A team project that reflected this was when I was paired up for a group presentation on ethics in engineering. I remember collaborating together with my teammates, throwing out topics like security cameras, self-driving vehicles, and deepfake technology. It was challenging at first to decide on topic due to everyone having different ideas. After some time, we eventually compromised and agreed to do our presentation on the ethical concerns of a camera drone. This initial interaction with working together with classmates I have not worked with before made me realize the importance trying to understand others' perspectives and opinions. It was during this brainstorming and researching on our topic, I found myself learning a lot. While I was more focused on the technical capabilities of drones, while the other focused on the privacy issues they raised. On top of sharing my thoughts, I was also picking up new ideas from them, things I had not considered. From working with others in the past, I find that working together is a great way to learn and teach others. While working with others can be just about splitting tasks and getting the job done, for me it is also about listening and seeing viewpoints come together. That is what I took away from that project, and it is what I believe collaboration is all about.",
            "Question 11": "When I was part of The First Tee, a youth organization that teaches life values and golf skills to those who do not have the opportunity to play golf, I learned to play golf and had the chance to volunteer for them as well. On one of the days I was volunteering as an assistant coach, offering tips and advice. We were right next to the green as I noticed a student struggling to get his ball out of a sand bunker. I remember how tough chipping was for me when I first started, so I walked over and asked if he needed help. He seemed frustrated but was open to advice, so I showed him a simple technique that had worked for me. I told him to imagine scooping the ball out of the sand with his club, focusing on a smooth, steady motion. The moment when he started getting the hang of it, sending the ball out of the bunker was memorable for me. Watching him improve reminded me of all the support I had received in The First Tee, something which I hope to pass on to others."

            "Question 8": "The pillar involving engineering development means the most to me, as I value the importance of creating opportunities that will help me develop professionally. Texas A&M is well-suited for providing ample opportunities to students, but a common problem that occurs is that students are unaware of these opportunities. Student Engineer Council is a unique organization that includes a lot of professional events and opportunities to network with other industries. During my time as a freshman, it was harder for me to find opportunities to grow both professionally and personally. Now, as a current junior, I have learned that A&M has so many resources that I still haven't been able to utilize fully. Knowing about these opportunities that I have just learned makes me regret missing these chances as a freshman. Throughout my college experience, I have explored many organizations, but none so far have truly helped me grow in the professional sense. A lot of the organizations that I have explored have helped me grow personally, and I have gained a lot of connections with other students. I aim to provide students with opportunities to not only develop professionally but to become aware of the corporate environment.",
            "Question 9": "When I set a goal for myself in the past, I define success as an experience that I can learn from. Even if I did not achieve my goal, I can still learn valuable insight from my mistakes. The important part of success is that I can grow as an individual. An instance is when I failed my first physics test in college. This was my first time failing in college, and I felt extremely unhappy and dissatisfied with my efforts. My goal was to do extremely well on the next test. I had this aversive feeling that I did not want to experience again. It pushed me to try even harder for my next test. Ultimately, I got a 97 on the test, and I was overjoyed with my effort. Not only did I achieve my goal, but I learned what it was truly like to give my full effort in academics. During my time studying, I also recognized that I needed to embrace failure, and I have changed my mindset every time a setback occurs because, in the end, I know it would turn out okay. From both examples, I defined these experiences as a success, as I learned valuable teachings from these situations even when the goal was not met; I defined it as success.",
            "Question 10": "This past summer, I conducted research in France, studying high-pressure die casting. It was a very interesting experience as I got to work in a different environment with individuals of different cultures. I had a supervisor who did his PhD in Australia and started to work as a lecturer and researcher at this France university. While working with him, I started to learn more about the French environment and the French workplace. A big observation that I made was that French professors give feedback in an extremely blunt tone. As I continued working with my supervisor and learning about the French workplace, I learned that the pure intention behind their feedback was to genuinely help you improve. My supervisor gave me some extremely straightforward feedback. It made me feel like I wasn't smart enough even as I had no experience before and little guidance as to what I was doing, but throughout my internship, I learned to accept and embrace their tone when they gave feedback and to look at the substance of what they were trying to communicate. This experience helped shape my perspective when working with others, as I have learned to not be heavily affected by an individual's attitude but to focus on the \"meat\" of their insight. This mindset helps me improve my teamwork skills and creates less anxiety as I shift my attention away from how they think about me and more about what I can contribute to the team.",
            "Question 11": "During my time at Big Event, I had the opportunity to help a local family with their backyard projects. Some of the things that we helped him with included pulling out the weeds, putting mulch in the garden, and removing heavy rocks from an unused garden and disposing of them on the truck.\nA big thing that I noticed is that the father also helped us with the yardwork, so he was actively involved in cleaning the yard. He helped provide us with water and also gave us food at the end, which was very considerate of him. In the end, we talked about his experiences at A&M and how his family came to live in College Station. Not only did I get to network with an A&M alumni, but I also had the opportunity to serve the local community by helping local families save time and effort. It was a very grateful experience, and I had a lot of fun landscaping his yard with my group."

While technical skills are crucial to being successful, I believe that the importance of professionalism and soft-skills are often overlooked. The SEC being able to host events such as the Career Fair, which helps to connect students with companies from a range of industries, helps to bridge this gap. This not only allows students to search for internships or job opportunities, but it allows for the development of these professional skills which will be needed after graduation.",
            "Question 9": "After starting college, I quickly realized the difference between college and high school courses. While in high school, I was aiming for perfect grades and scores which I was achieving with no sweat. But once I got into college, I understood that my previous definition of success needed to change. I had always been a perfectionist but had to begin to work on consistent improvement. One saying that stuck with me which I tell myself is that \u201cWinning isn\u2019t always about being first, it\u2019s about being better than you were when you started.\u201d This tied into a previous concept I learned of becoming 1% better every day.\nConnor McGregor once spoke about his struggle with accomplishing his goals and reaching the success he dreamed of. He emphasized the importance of getting those small victories every single day, whether it is making your bed, going to sleep at a certain time, or not procrastinating to complete a task. These seemingly simple and minor achievements would pile up and help to build the momentum needed to achieve your much larger goals. For me, I took that advice and applied it to my everyday life. I started making my bed every morning and going to all of my 8am\u2019s whether I was tired or not. I would get my homework done well in advance and go workout everyday. I found that by achieving all of these small wins, I was getting closer to the big goals that I wanted to reach.",
            "Question 10": "The one opportunity that helped shape my view of what makes a team, was my internship with the Army this summer. I was hired into a Data and Software Engineering role on the Data and Platform Divisions team at the headquarters. The unique part of working with the government, especially the military, was that I was collaborating with Soldiers, Civilians, and Contractors. I had the opportunity to see a wide range of leadership styles and tactics from different groups. The military thinks in the long-term success of a product, aiming for \u201cArmy of 2040\u201d and \u201cArmy of 2050\u201d, while the Civilians and Contractors support this by working in small teams to ensure that they are always on track.\nAnother aspect that I learned was the importance of communication in a team. At the start, I had no clue what a lot of acronyms meant or how to use GitLab and Azure. However, by asking questions, I found that I would learn quicker and would be able to excel in my role. I had gained a strong understanding of what an effective team is and what makes one successful. The Army is the best example of teamwork at its best, and I was able to see first hand why. I will be able to bring this experience with me as I develop in college and transfer into the professional environment post-graduation.",
            "Question 11": "During high school, I played on the varsity baseball team my Junior and Senior years. One thing the varsity team did differently from the JV team was our involvement with the Dripping Springs community. The most notable experience for me was our annual Christmas gift drive. We would raise money and connect with local families who were struggling to afford presents for the holidays. As a team, we would visit these families and get a wishlist of what they wanted for Christmas. After practice, we would go shopping and purchase the gifts. Once we had all the gifts, the team would get together, wrap them, and write cards for each family. When we were done, we visited our assigned family and delivered the gifts to them, which was a special moment. This moment was meaningful for me because I didn\u2019t realize how many families were struggling to provide presents for their children. This made me want to volunteer as much as possible and prompted me to join organizations like Ags REACH."

It allows them to preach about themselves to the community. It will also enable them to hone their skills and reinforce their mentality. Professional development is crucial as it is needed to advance through their careers.\nI value professional development because it builds a foundation for your mindset and the ability to adapt. These traits are important to create a strong problem-solving engineer. It also helps the engineers to stay up-to-date with the latest changes in their associated field. Things change and engineers must adapt to that significant change. As everyone knows, engineering can be very challenging. Professional development allows engineers to maintain a strong mindset while taking on new challenges and responsibilities. These traits gained by professional development allow engineers to bloom and show their hard work to the world. I believe that professional development helped me throughout my freshman year and allowed me to get where I am today.",
            "Question 9": "In the past, I once set a goal for myself to pass the AP human geography exam. It was my first AP class and I wanted to challenge myself with the rigorous work. However, this proved to be difficult. I had so much time taken away from me with other classes and extracurriculars. It challenged my time management and I had to spend most of the time doing the homework at midnight. I had to memorize many different events and vocabulary terms. I also had to read long chapters in the textbook and discuss content in class. However, I was able to push through on the weekends by setting some hard deadlines for myself. I would try and get the homework at least 3 days before the due date and read the textbook before we covered it in class. By doing this, I was able to stay on top of things. When the AP test was coming close, I set a small goal for myself to study for the exam for at least an hour a day. Then when the test came I was prepared and got a 4 on the exam. My success was not only passing the exam, it was also the determination and setting small goals for myself throughout the year.",
            "Question 10": "One summer, I worked as a server for a local restaurant. This was the first time I experienced why teamwork is essential to work in a fast-paced environment. On my first day of working, my first table was a 10-top. Having to go around asking for their orders, inputting them into the computer correctly, checking if they needed any refills, delivering their food, and checking on them regularly was a pain in the neck. I wasn\u2019t prepared for such, but luckily my manager saw me struggle and guided me throughout the process. He helped me with the 10-top and together we made a smooth sailing service. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I would have gotten some angry customers. But it didn\u2019t end there. I had to provide service to different tables at the same time. I had difficulty multitasking because it was my first time dealing with many guests. However, I was able to push through because my co-workers helped me serve food and with the orders. I would sometimes forget to get the food but my co-workers would always serve the food to my table and help me with refills. This experience shaped my perspective on teamwork. It made me realize that some tasks are difficult to accomplish alone. I used this experience to tackle hard problems with my engineering teammates.",
            "Question 11": "Around 8th grade, I volunteered at my local library to fulfill my NJHS service hours. I organized books, read to children, assisted librarians and other volunteers, worked at the front desk for the summer reading program, and helped with social events. Seeing the children\u2019s joy when I gifted them prizes was very rewarding, and I always encouraged them to complete their summer reading goals.\nOne memorable event was when Orbit, the Astros' mascot, visited the library. The event ran from 1 PM to 4 PM. I arrived early to help set up and assist Orbit with his preparations. Once the event began, I greeted kids and adults with a smile, managed the line to keep it from getting congested, and directed kids to curve the line around the library to avoid the hot weather outside. After the event, I helped put away the equipment and was thrilled to get a picture with Orbit. This experience helped me build connections and become a more responsible student. I loved serving the local library so much that I came back every year."

My experience with development ranges from reading personal development books and my co-op experiences at LyondellBasell. Personally, and within the industry, improvement of knowledge, goals, and skills are critical to the commitment to the art of development. At LyondellBasell, we uphold high standards for the continued growth of our engineers. Fortunately, I was able to proactively participate in educating my colleagues by giving a workshop for our site\u2019s reliability team on the ethics of The National Society of Professional Engineers. This ethics workshop enabled me to create a presentation and share it with practicing engineers; thus, enhancing my understanding of ethics and serving as a valuable refresher for industry professionals. Within my everyday life, I have fostered an appreciation for self-help books and their impacts on personal progress. Staples and influences of my perspective include 'How Talk to Anyone' by Leil Lowndes, \u2018Ego is the Enemy\u2019 by Ryan Holiday, \u2018The law of Human Nature' by Robert Greene, and \u2018The 48 Laws of Power' by Robert Greene. For the progression of the industry, self, and humanity the development of knowledge, goals, and skills is essential for advancement.",
            "Question 9": "Success to me is defined in the completion of a task done to the best of my ability, quality, and impact of which I can possibly output. While working at a Lyondellbasell polymer plant, during my most recent co-op, I was tasked to create a business case to purchase and install EmpathCMS\u2019s in our extruder units. To initiate the process, the business case requires approval from our L2. Of which, the company's accountants thoroughly review the case and deliberate the cost, effort, and investment opportunity for the company. Once approved, weekly progress reports were essential for the progression and maintaining the focal points of the project. Some examples of these focal points include goals such as, \u201cIdentify all motors that are process critical to the extruders,\u201d or ,\u201dCreate a cost justification using the past ten years of data.\u201d Goals and success are interconnected in the way of which they facilitate and set a path to the finish line. Here, at the finish line, the satisfaction of maintaining forward motion, arriving at the finish line, and seeing the people or organizations benefit and continue with their purpose is what motivates me and signifies the pinnacle of success.",
            "Question 10": "My perspective of working with others has changed overtime. As a child, I would rely solely on my independence to complete assignments. I had difficulty trusting that my peers would contribute the same quality of work and deemed my self sufficiency greater. Coming into college, I quickly realized that group work was unavoidable. Not only would my self sufficiency in group projects lead me to infringe upon my value of integrity but deprive others of contributing. A prime example of this would be in ENGR 216 where I had to rely on the knowledge of the other group members. During this time, I found that in moments of uncertainty and work distribution, group members are essential to the collaboration and cross-section of diverse ideas and progress. Efficiency is found in the trust, communication, and opportunity given to group members. Each member knew what they were capable of contributing and helped to fill in the deficiencies of others. Other experiences in group environments include my time as an umpire. The environment of which we endure can be of high pressure and quick decision making, for this reason trust and communication had to be developed.",
            "Question 11": "In the past, I was a group leader for John 15. In this organization, we strive to exemplify christian values and serve our community. A particular time of servitude that I led and participated in was Angel Tree. I feel incredibly blessed to be in a position to serve others and to provide an experience for others of which they may not have. Christmas is a time of servitude, gratitude, and community. The quality of community is often in meeting the needs of the community in order to prosper. Families that participate in Angel tree are in need of much more than a helping hand. Thinking beyond the direct impact, Angel tree mitigates the social dynamics and conversations when coming back from winter break. The parents can focus on saving money to pay bills, to save, and to get help in meeting the needs of the family. Service goes beyond getting items on a list, it is to understand the impact of such experiences and create a continuity of deeper level understanding."

This one specifically stands out to me because when I was a freshman there were so many things I wish I knew that would have set me up for success now. For example getting involved in a professional organization early and developing your technical skills through projects. It might seem pointless, but these organizations often get overlooked during students freshman and sophomore year because they are so focused on the social organizations on campus. I want to be an advocate for having a social life as it\u2019s a necessity for success, but also advertising these more professional organizations like Aggie Coding Club, Aggie Data Science Club, and SEC for other computer science majors. This involvement will allow for younger students to gain project experience and then eventually step into leadership roles helping them in the eventual recruitment process for jobs and internships.",
            "Question 9": "When I was younger the word \u2018Success\u2019 used to mean to become the richest person ever. My literal goal as a kid was to have more money than anyone alive and have this crazy amount of money where I could buy whatever I want whenever I wanted to. Over time however, I realized that having all this money wouldn\u2019t define success for me anymore. I did however figure out that the new and profound definition of success for myself was to make a positive lasting impact on the people around me. My want to grow and develop as a leader has only grown and because of this I\u2019ve put myself in positions of leadership within my mens organization by being a co-executive as well as being involved in other organizations like fish camp where you can impact incoming freshman by giving them advice and lessons you learned while being at A&M.",
            "Question 10": "Being a 17 year old shift lead at Dutch Bros greatly strengthened my leadership skills, but also shaped my perspective on the \u2018right\u2019 way to work with others. What I learned was there is no \u2018right\u2019 way to work with others because each and every human is so different. Being 17 I worked alongside and was in charge of other 17 year old's, along with kids younger than me, as well as 22 year old's who were in college. The way I communicated with someone who I had calculus with during the school day and somebody who was 5 years older than me about to graduate college was drastically different. Oftentimes the kids my age needed more motivation, so I had to lead by example and explain why we followed a certain protocol as they focused mainly on just the money they got from the job. The college kids on the other hand took the job more seriously, but I had to take a more collaborative approach to motivate and lead them because who would want a 17 year old to be in charge of them. So more conversational and intrinsic motivation was used to work with the college students. Overall this experience allowed me to grow as a young leader and learn to understand different kinds of people and how to work with them and make all of them cooperate with one another.",
            "Question 11": "The Boys and Girls Club of Bryan/College Station provides care and opportunities for the underprivileged children in our community. This place is special to me because it's the philanthropy for my organization and the countless hours I spend there always is worth the time and effort. The kids in this community are often the first ones from their family tree to even consider college. Our goal as volunteers is to be good role models for the kids so they are motivated to stay in school and eventually pursue college. One of the best ways we serve this community is through songfest, a competition where you portray a movie through dancing, and the winner of this competition receives $25,000 for its philanthropy of choice. Participating in these events along with volunteering at the actual club by playing basketball or helping cook dinner are some of the ways I get involved within the community and help serve others."

            "Question 8": "Although all the pillars are very interesting, the External pillar from the SEC Mission Statement is the most intriguing to me. I believe the different ideas of engineering were never properly introduced to me in school and I was heavily influenced by my father who shared his interests with me from an early age. However, I understand not many people are fortunate with the same circumstances and must be guided to new ideas through other gateways. This is why I appreciate the idea of the EnVision Conference and Engineers\u2019 week that spreads awareness to young minds and the public in general. It\u2019s not fair that engineering at times is depicted as a difficult subject with no other insight given. This mindset pushes away new people and their curiosity by those who themselves have been misled. However, being able to spread knowledge and let people make their own judgement about the field through public events is something I would be interested in being a part of. I want to be part of a community that understands these issues and be able to provide those curious with proper resources.",
            "Question 9": "In the past success meant achieving a short-term goal instantly. However, upon reassessment, there is still success even when the goal isn\u2019t immediately met. Success to me is how I go about the process towards achieving something. Oftentimes I find working with only a large goal in mind overwhelming and leading to disappointment. Instead of thinking about what I had set initially, I think about what I can do to make the process leading towards it efficient and manageable. That mindset eases the process towards the initial goal rather than placing stress about something that at first seems unrealistic. This applies to any type of goal. Although the idea seems very simple and generic I genuinely believe the only way to achieve set goals is by focusing on the pathway to it rather than the final step. Therefore, success in a goal isn\u2019t about how much of it was achieved but rather how it was achieved.",
            "Question 10": "In my sophomore year of high school, I started volunteering at a therapeutic horsemanship. The organization held horse riding lessons for students with special needs, providing support through side walking and leading the horses. All riders had different strengths so as a side walker we had to be able to adapt to their senses while leaders would to lead the horse, making sure the horse suited the rider. Being involved in the lessons weekly and interacting with different types of riders brought a sense of inner peace in between my hectic schedule at the time. I was grateful to have been given the opportunity in working there as I don\u2019t believe any other place could have given me the sense of support they have. The family members of the riders would express their gratitude towards the community and the horses would divide their attention to the riders. It was wholesome seeing an authentic bond being made between the horses and the riders leaving a sense of peace. The experiences in that organization and seeing the other volunteers selflessly working multiple hours in ensuring the enjoyment of riders encouraged me to do the same. Being able to work hard and see the riders and their families being rewarded through a successful lesson brought heartwarming moments.",
            "Question 11": "For last year\u2019s Big Event, my mentorship group was assigned to painting the house and weeding the yard. It had been a while since I had last volunteered and was looking forward to the change in pace. The family provided us with equipment and food. I was still unfamiliar with college and my mentorship, so I was slightly nervous to spending extended time with them. However, to my surprise the environment was very calm and relaxing. Everyone was doing their designated job with very small conversations happening in between; it was a comfortable silence. The family would come out of the house and express their gratitude through words and food. Being able to make even small changes through few hours makes a huge impact on the community. It was nice being able to see that my work was making a direct impact on someone\u2019s life."

            "Question 8": "The SEC's focus on \"Fostering the Professional Advancement of all engineering students\" is the pillar of the mission statement that I believe is most important. Career fairs, networking events, company talks, and other events are crucial for students at the college of engineering to meet industry members and recruiters, build their network, and most importantly get plugged into the Aggie Network. I think that the Aggie Network is one of the most powerful aspects of going to Texas A&M, and the SEC creating these events to plug students into it is incredibly important and useful for the development and growth of engineers at this school.",
            "Question 9": "Coming into Texas A&M, I knew that it would be a struggle to ETAM into the Computer Engineering department after my freshman year and I knew that I would have to work much harder than I ever had in high school in order to stay on top of my courses and keep the 3.75 GPA threshold that is practically required these days for the major. At the beginning of my freshman year, I defined success in that goal to get into the major by setting the standard much higher than was really necessary - a 4.0. My philosophy in life is to set the expectations for yourself much higher than the bare minimum necessary, as if you achieve your set goal than you can have the satisfaction of doing your superior work, but if you don't quite hit your mark then you are most likely still fine. Never set your sights on the bare minimum, but shoot for excellence in all things at all times. While I didn't quite reach the 4.0 goal I had set for myself, by setting my standards this high I was able to still be an automatic admit with only one B in my coursework during my freshman year.",
            "Question 10": "The activity that shaped my perspective on collaborating with others the most was my time the various bands and orchestras that I have participated in. These different teams of musicians taught me the importance of doing your part, working together, and trusting your fellow members in order to combine all of the individual parts into the piece. Unlike many other teams, there is no way for one person to 'carry' the group in music, as each part is entirely different and crucial to the piece, and this is how I now look at teamwork in general. While in many situations it is possible or even necessary for one person to take over a group and do most of the work, but I believe that it is more important to assist your team members to do their own part effectively rather than just taking over for them. Instead of mistrusting the members of your team, instead assist them and coach them in order to let them grow into their part and allow you to trust them and them to trust you.",
            "Question 11": "Service and leadership are incredibly important to me, which is why this year I am leading a freshman small group as a part of a larger off-campus organization to walk alongside a few freshmen here at A&M to help guide them throughout their freshman year. Freshman year is always difficult for new students, and I help serve them by being alongside them and being there to help them academically, give them a home place to come back to throughout the year, and be a mentor for them throughout the year. Though we only meet once a week, this program gives the freshmen who are new to the university a place to come back to, and as their leader and mentor I walk alongside them throughout the year."

            "Question 8": "Professional advancement is the pillar that sticks out the most to me. College is the point in our education where we learn not only about our field of study and, in our case, how to be engineers, but also about how to be professionals and conduct ourselves as such. For example, I focused solely on academics during my high school career\u2014while I had joined several honor societies and a few clubs sporadically, they were only supplemental, taking a back seat to my studies. Now that I've reached a satisfactory point in my life - an electrical engineering major at Texas A&M - I'm finally allowing my studies to take a chill pill to pave the way for extracurricular activities and organizations, such as IEEE and SEC, to promote my professional development. While it's great to be on the receiving end by attending career fairs, workshops, symposiums, and industry meet-and-greets, SEC would also enable me to involve myself with opportunities such as these to further develop my organization and leadership abilities.",
            "Question 9": "The SAT is what many would call the most significant test of their high school career. I knew my performance on this three-hour examination would determine my future: where I would go to college and the opportunities that would henceforth be available to me. I wanted to keep things simple, so I strove to score at least a 1500 in one attempt. It was June; I planned to take the test in December. The following six months, I did very little besides studying for the SAT through Khan Academy, drilling math and English into my brain until it felt like I knew everything. Back then, tests and quizzes were pushovers, requiring little more than a few hours of preparation to ace them all\u2014a fact that becomes exceedingly obvious as I progress through college. It wasn't until that point in my life that I faced such an obstacle in the form of a test, and its intensity demanded equally intense studying. Ultimately, I was faced with the SAT, on a chilly December morning, armed with the knowledge of six months of non-stop preparation. My goal remained the same - a 1500 in one attempt - and as I left the test center, I couldn't help but feel a little apprehension. Two weeks later, however, I woke up to an email of my final score - a 1550 - and knew that all of my work had paid off in dividends.",
            "Question 10": "Throughout my general education in my freshman year at A&M, teamwork was seldom a factor. Every time I was paired with others to \"work as a team,\" the task was often rudimentary - easy enough that any member of the team could complete it on their lonesome - or the teammates with whom I was paired demonstrated acute lackadaisicalness, forcing me to persevere despite them. This previous summer, however, I was faced with my first part-time job: a serving position at a fantastic Tex-Mex restaurant. Preceding my employment, I had grossly underestimated the responsibilities and hardships of those in the serving industry, nor had I any idea of the diligence or, more importantly, the teamwork required to thrive and survive. Shifts were often fast-paced and demanding, with customers' insatiable desires only rivaled by their appetites. It was only then, especially as a new hire, that I truly experienced teamwork\u2014only through the guidance of my superiors and fellow servers was I able to succeed in this foreign experience. I would regularly depend upon other servers to assist me during busy times, the same way they would often lean on me for help. It was in this time I also learned how to handle failures, as others would lift me up during my shortcomings so that I would either not repeat the same mistakes or know how to overcome them on my lonesome.",
            "Question 11": "In addition to my part-time job as a server this summer, I demonstrated serving others through community service with my friend at a place called Harvest for the Hungry, a non-profit that grows fresh produce for those in need in Texas. Although it perhaps wasn't as direct as serving customers at a restaurant, I could feel the difference I made every time I came to volunteer, be it helping with cleanup after the hurricane, preparing for events, picking weeds, feeding the animals, and anything in between. Truthfully, I've always loved cleaning and busywork - a trait I've no doubt inherited from my mom after nineteen years of chores - but to do such with a purpose so fulfilling is a different kind of pleasure altogether. Subsequently, I also gained a greater appreciation for where I am as a person and how fortunate I am not to want for food. Service in this manner enables you to see things from a new, grateful perspective, and I would happily give my service again should the opportunity present itself."

When I think of my experience in engineering, I would describe it as a community of people that serve others while also having the opportunity to grow themselves. As a first year college student, I thought that the career fair would be a waste of time, but it gave me a good insight of what was expected of me. I learned how I should talk to recruiters, structure my resume, and prepare for networking events. As a freshman, I realized the importance of getting referrals and connecting with people in the desired company play a vital role when applying to internships. With the opportunities given to me from SEC, I was able to be more confident and successful in my professional abilities and I hope that I\u2019m able to do the same for my peers.",
            "Question 9": "It was my first year of competing in powerlifting where I wanted to be at the top. This was the year that I had qualified for regionals, but I needed to lose 10 pounds in 5 days. This required me to eat one meal a day and cut down on my water intake. I felt so fulfilled that I was able to cut down my weight. However, on the way to the event I got a phone call saying that the season was canceled due to covid. Initially, I was upset but I decided to start working harder for next season. When the next season came around I was unable to compete due to the season still being suspended. It was at this time where I was on the edge of giving up powerlifting, but when I thought more about the supportive community and the thrill of competing, I couldn't just give it up. As my final season came along, I ended up getting plantar fasciitis, while also being nominated captain of the powerlifting team. As I continued to push through the season, I decided that I would stay on a consistent diet so that I wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake as last time. I ended up qualifying for regionals. When it came time to compete, I ended up doing the best I ever did and was able to break a previous school record, proving that my hard work and dedication paid off.",
            "Question 10": "Recently I participated in a hackathon with a friend that I had met in my electrical circuits class, and his close friend. I was unsure how this event would go because I did not know them too well and this was our first time taking part in a hackathon. We were given multiple prompts that ranged from cybersecurity to even environmental engineering. Each of us had different interests when it came to what type of hardware and what to focus on. Throughout the hackathon, we communicated and collaborated to come up with a certain topic that would interest each of us. There were times where one person would know a certain thing and would teach us along the way. There were also times where one of us would reach a point where it was difficult to make progress, and to combat this we would keep one another motivated and bounce ideas back and forth. Throughout the project, we would take breaks and get to know each other, which helped the way we worked together. Our differences made things so much more interesting and entertaining. I realized that working with others that have different strengths and interests can make a project so much better than it would\u2019ve been if I had worked alone.",
            "Question 11": "Last semester I took a differential equations class and I had some friends that were also taking the class at that time. While I found myself doing pretty good in the class, some of my friends were struggling and were not understanding the material. I found out about this before finals. I offered to help and I set up a study group during finals week. Before meeting up with them I made an outline of the main topics that would be on the final, what we should focus on, and topics we should practice in detail. When we started studying, it was interesting seeing how different explanations on certain topics helped some people understand, whereas for other people I had to find different ways to explain the material. Studying in a group was rewarding, and it was nice that we were able to work through the problems together. I felt accomplished because I was able to help people alongside me succeed."

Having been a freshman who just went through the ETAM process very recently, I know how confusing and stressful that first year can be. Knowing that I can say it would be great to have a voice regarding those quirks in the engineering program. I won\u2019t have to go through ETAM again, but I\u2019d like to be able to advocate for some changes to improve the system for future freshmen. Even though ETAM has been my main issue in my limited time here, I\u2019m going to be here for a few more years, and I want that remaining time to not only further me in my professional journey, but I want the time to be enjoyable and less stressful as well. Being a part of SEC will not only allow me to help improve these four years for myself but also for the thousands of other engineering students that will pass through this school.",
            "Question 9": "Back in high school, when I was applying to colleges, my goal, like many others, was to get into a good school. At the time, my measuring stick for success was whether or not I got into my dream school, UT Austin. I did not end up getting accepted, and it felt as if all the work I put in for the last four years just went to waste. Now that some time has passed and I\u2019ve experienced what life is like here, I can confidently say that the cliche saying \u201crejection is redirection\u201d holds true. Looking back, I know how wrong I was to think all the things that I did when I received my rejection, but this taught me that just because you may not meet the goals you set for yourself, doesn\u2019t mean you failed. After some time, that \u201cfailure\u201d may seem like nothing more than a small road bump. However, this isn\u2019t to say that you shouldn\u2019t set high bars for yourself, more so that it\u2019s not the end of the world if things inevitably go wrong.",
            "Question 10": "During high school, I worked at a restaurant as a server. Obviously, in a setting like that, people are forced to work together. Throughout my time at that job, I began to appreciate how well and efficiently things could get done when people were helping each other. This was a stark contrast to my mindset at the time as I used to prefer to work alone on most things, especially when it came to school work. I\u2019d spend long amounts of time on projects and assignments because I\u2019d rather not ask anyone else for help and figure things out myself. As I said earlier, I didn\u2019t have any choice but to work with other people at my job so I learned that working with others doesn\u2019t have a downside, it can only help. That mindset taught me not only to work with others for things but to be more resourceful as well. Now not only do I love working on things with other people, but I also dislike having to work on my own.",
            "Question 11": "During the Islamic month of Ramadan, I along with a few other volunteers helped put together nearly a thousand meals and serve them to anyone in attendance at my local mosque. On any given night, there would be approximately 700 people that needed a meal. In our culture, Ramadan is not only a very important month religiously, but it\u2019s also a time when people feel a strong sense of community that is not comparable to many other feelings in my opinion. Since I\u2019ve been volunteering at that mosque from a very young age, I\u2019ve known for a while now how fulfilling it can be to serve people. Being able to play a part in making that special time easier and more enjoyable for hundreds of people in my community is a great time."

            "Question 8": "The pillar of professional advancement strikes me the most.\nI remember my first career fair during the last spring semester like it was yesterday. I got off the bus and walked in and immediately felt the wave of insecurities take over. It was a large outlook with so many people. One thing I remember in particular were individuals with SEC-labeled t-shirts who guided me into the building. I knew I had seen that name before somewhere at ZACH, but I couldn't quite place my finger on it.\nAfter further speculation, I discovered that it was infact a student-led organization that planned the career-fair, and I was stunned. I couldn't believe that students were responsible for an event that would eventually lead to a handful of other students getting professional opportunities. I knew I wanted to be a part of that immediately!\nSometimes, in life, it's very easy to get wrapped up in one's own bubble and prioritize self above all. Afterall, It's your life that you're living. However, this little efforts that are intentionally made to help others make the most difference. We rise by lifting others, and I would be honored to be a member of this team.",
            "Question 9": "Before the summer, I made it a goal to take Phys 207.\nI knew I wanted to be more involved school and was determined to reduce my hours to accommodate that involvement. However, this goal was made towards the near end of May, meaning most colleges were at their maximum capacity for their classes.\nI remember calling almost 20 community colleges during that time just hoping that they had any class left for me to fill. I wanted to give up so badly. I was tired of getting no's and desperately wished I had taken this decision earlier so as to not find myself in my current predicament.\nI was definitely hard on myself during that time, and I had to take sometime to actually offer myself some grace. It's not like I made the goal and then did not start on time to look for available classes and schools. I did that swiftly but was just caught up in the unfortunate reality of not having registered for a summer class early enough.\nThis introspective realization helped me offer myself some grace and that motivated me to keep looking. Eventually I found a class, and that for me was not even what I considered success. It was the fact that when things didn't go as planned, I didn't allow myself to sink in a hole; blaming myself for circumstances that I couldn't physically control. I forged on and persevered even when the odds weren't working in my favor. That for me is success.",
            "Question 10": "My first semester as a freshman, I took the rather notorious class - ENGR 102.\nI didn't have any experience whatsoever with python prior to that class and was confused most of the time during the lectures. In my group, one of my teammates on the other hand had been coding for 6+ years and made it quite evident that he knew what he was doing.\nUnfortunately the coding experience he had attained was more destructive than constructive to our overall teamwork culture. We practically had to beg him to help out, which was quite frustrating, considering how he already knew exactly what to do.\nI was exhausted and in many cases found myself feeling uneasy, but it dawned on me that this was the first time I was experiencing friction with a fellow group member in my entire life. A wider realization was made when I came to the understanding that as an engineer, I was definitely going to have many more encounters with many people like him.\nThis understanding helped me to not take things personally. Of course, everyone would prefer to be buddies with whoever their working with. It generally makes things better, but that's not always the case and making sure that the goal you've set as a group to achieve is not jeopardized especially when the team work culture is not pleasant, takes a lot of resilience and determination.",
            "Question 11": "Last semester, I oversaw the 4D-Geometry category of the Math and Stats Fair for the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&M University.\nWe implemented interactive methods to initiate interest in geometric structures, leading to extensive comprehension of 3D and 4D structures.\nThe idea was to create 4D structures and then dip the structures in soapy water, forming bubble 3D structures. This way, the kids were really interested in learning, seeing as they got to play with bubbles. I also collaborated with other volunteers in tutorial sessions, resulting in increased participant involvement."

            "Question 8": "Of the three pillars, Engineering Awareness resonates with me the most. Personally, being an engineer is much more than just applying rigorous mathematical concepts for applicability, it's about the gathering of passionate individuals who are motivated to a common goal, the collaboration of diverse backgrounds, and a birthplace for new ideas. Increasing engineering awareness will promote a versatile, well-rounded community built by people, for the people. What I look forward to within this pillar is hopefully being able to inspire someone through engineering. Being able to introduce someone to something new and sharing an similar appreciation is an amazing thing.",
            "Question 9": "I have always defined success as achieving measurable goals on the way to success. I compare success to dreams in the same way. Defining success can be ambiguous, in the same way achieving a dream can be somewhat unclear. The key point to consider in achieving success or living your dream is the journey that it takes. I am a firm believer in dreams without goals and staying dreams. However, dreams with realistic, achievable goals are far more likely to become realistic. It would be naive to set a goal and work towards it. But approached with a different mentality, setting a goal with various subgoals and tangible benchmarks is a better way to map out motivation. Rather than defining success as this single point one day, long in the future when I land a dream job or have a dream physique, it is rather I maintain being successful by constantly achieving these little attainable benchmarks that I set for myself. Although, it is important not to lose sight of the ultimate dream, but to reinforce motivation with the small victory.",
            "Question 10": "I was part of a team working on building a mound at a local protected park. This was a project that involved many weeks of preparation, resource management, and planning. Once the project day emerged, the team members were split up into partitions to execute different parts of the project, from mulch collection, transportation, and storage. During the project, I noticed that some of the team members were not engaged in their part of the project. After communicating with them if there was an issue, it turned out that they were not experienced and they tired out quickly. Along with a couple of people from my section, offered to periodically switch roles so they can be engaged with the project. It was important that we did not completely switch roles because of a learning experience for both sides. The main takeaways from this experience is ensuring that all members of the team are working toward their strengths, being aware of your position within a team, and being able to be flexible to unknown circumstances.",
            "Question 11": "Being a part of the Science Honor Society, we hosted several events that align well with the statutes that SEC holds up, especially engineering awareness. One of these events was hosted in collaboration with the Girl Scouts of America, for new potential scouts. We had a booth in which we aided little girls with teaching, designing, and creating bird feeders using repurposed plastic and material. Within this event, I embodied 3 different outlets for service: the community, my peers, and the kids. It was wonderful being part of a team that worked together to help these kids, balancing the responsibilities of maintaining efficient communication between my team members to deliver the best experience for the kids."

The external division of SEC, which is in charge of increasing engineering awareness speaks to me because of its philanthropy and community benefit. Whether it be someone to talk to, help with homework, or even just holding a door open, I love helping people by any means. I believe the external division has the same ideals. Joining the SEC's external division would be a mutualistic relationship. I would have the pleasure of helping others who share the same passions that I do via the division's events, such as the Spark conference, while the SEC would have a dedicated member to help execute one of its mission statements.",
            "Question 9": "I do not have an exact definition of success. To me, it is a feeling achieved only by being able to see the results of your work and being content with it. To liven up our backyard, my dad decided to add a pond. The process was simple yet long and physically demanding. It required hours of shoveling dirt, moving hundreds of pounds of rocks and stones, lining the pond, and setting up an outlet for the filter in an area where electricity was not previously accessible. We could not say we had succeeded by only accomplishing one or two of those tasks since we had not completed everything. This experience taught me that, and I was reminded of it again during the etam process. I had worked relentlessly throughout the year to keep my grades up as high as possible. I knew there was no room for error because, with just one screw-up, I would be out of the running for computer science. I knew I had succeeded once I woke up and saw an email from the engineering advising department congratulating me on my admission into CPSC.",
            "Question 10": "As a senior in high school, I was a part of the PALS program. I had three children I'd visit every week. I had a 7th grader I'd see on Wednesday, a 5th grader on Tuesdays, and a 3rd grader on Thursdays. For children of similar age, you would assume they all behaved the same, but that could not be further from the case. My 7th grader was sporadic and unpredictable. My 5th grader was quiet and soft-spoken. My 3rd grader was confident and verbose. Being a reserved person myself, I was not sure how to handle them. As the weeks went by, I grew to understand those children better and that everyone has to be dealt with differently. I would put on a different personality every day to match the child I was with; from that, we grew amazing friendships, and I miss them dearly. Being yourself with everybody isn't going to work. Sometimes, you have to adapt yourself to fit the other person better, and my experience with PALS taught me to do so.",
            "Question 11": "During quarantine, my parents would be busy at work, and I would be stuck at home, usually not paying attention to my teachers talking through the Zoom meetings. Doing this gave me a lot of free time, and since my 82-year-old grandma was living with us at the time, I did not want her to do anything herself. I would run down to be able to hold her hands while walking up the stairs right as I'd hear her taking her slippers off to reduce any pain she felt. I blew off classes just to give her company and massages throughout the day. I frequently gave her snacks and drinks, knowing she would feel too guilty to take them herself, being as pure as she is. Serving my grandma has been and forever will be my greatest honor. My experiences with my grandmother taught me more about service than anything else could. It is this same service I would apply to the SEC if admitted."

            "Question 8": "Professional Advancement means the most to me because it is the reason why we come to college in addition to getting a degree. This crucial part of college is something that I initially struggled with as neither of my parents are engineers, but because of the Corps and my determination to succeed, I was able to persevere. While I think all three pillars are very important, I like to focus on the most practical aspect of any given situation. In this case, being able to help students develop their career throughout college and observe them making their dreams a reality is something I would treasure and work very hard at. I want people to take advantage of the resources at Texas A&M to further their career aspirations in the best way they possibly can. After all, everyone enrolls in college to further their professional development!",
            "Question 9": "A fundamental goal of mine I had upon enrolling in chemical engineering was to obtain an internship for the summer of 2023. A part of it was to gain industry experience, but it was a little more personal than that to me. No family member of mine was or had been an engineer, so I really didn't have anyone in my family I could ask career advice from. Additionally, there was a lingering fear I had regarding whether if I would enjoy it or not. So, not only would this serve as industry experience, it would show me what it's like to be a real engineer and most importantly, would show if engineering was the right choice for me. I really took some serious time to develop my professional skills that year. The Fall 2022 Career Fair was the first career fair I had been to, so I had no idea how to sufficiently navigate it. Luckily, the Spring 2023 Career Fair went way better. I took the time in between the two fairs to polish my professional skills and apply to jobs on LinkedIn frequently. Luckily, I was blessed with a summer 2023 internship offer for the Petrochemical company Westlake AND a Fall 2023 Co-op offer with Marathon Petroleum Corporation. I am ecstatic to say that my experiences at these companies put my fears to rest and made me feel like engineering was something I was meant to do.",
            "Question 10": "Due to the Corps of Cadets and The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, I get the opportunity to practice leadership and teamwork skills daily. Sometimes, it's great, but other times, there are lots of learning experiences. One of these learning experiences happened last spring. My home outfit (or unit) was planning to do an 9 mile run at the beginning of April to the Nuclear Reactor from the Quad and back. We call this a \"Nuke Run\" and it is a yearly tradition. I had been playing a crucial role during the semester in preparing my outfit of about 50 people to be able to run successfully. Everything was going well, until it wasn't. About a month before the run, I started planning for the run and it went relatively well. However, about a week before the run, I was informed by my superiors that I was missing several things that needed to be submitted and sent out prior to this time. Nobody had communicated this to me prior. I tried getting moving on the things I was missing ASAP and I got everything in relatively quickly, but the run didn't end up getting approved. Instead, I had to modify the route to go 9 miles around campus. Although this was not great, it taught me the importance of communication and flexibility. It also taught me that no matter how much you plan for something, there will always be something that can go wrong and you must be prepared for that.",
            "Question 11": "As a sophomore in the Corps, you get to be in charge of 1-2 freshmen and are directly responsible for building them up as leaders. I had 2 fish. One of them was very squared away while the other struggled. In November, fish in the Corps culminate as full members after they demonstrate all their Corps knowledge. When November came around, I was spending several hours a week going over every piece of Corps related knowledge with my struggling fish and tried to support him in every way I could. I scheduled many sessions with him and I was at his beck and call whenever he needed help. I tried to teach him several different methods of doing things and hoped he would get it. However, he didn't end up culminating with the remainder of the Corps. He was set back from everyone else and eventually left the Corps. Despite my genuine & sincere best efforts and countless hours I put in, I was unable to see him culminate. It was one of my biggest failures, but something I will always carry with me as a learning experience."

            "Question 8": "I was attracted by fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students within the College of Engineering. I resonate more in this mission statement because it also matches my personal purpose for professional development. As a first generation university student in my family, I was told to get a decent job, but nobody tells me the details: how to select from resources? How to build your network? How to sell yourself to impress your employers? These are all vacant pieces in my path of development.\nI want to join because it SEC provides me an opportunity to learn to be professional with my peers. Serve the community is to accomplish my personal goal. I sincerely hope I can get involved this big mission in a team where we can serve for the same goal and have fun.",
            "Question 9": "Defining a goal is the most critical step in accomplishing my goal. If it's a task, then I have to finish it by the due date with satisfying quality. If it's a vague goal like language studying, I would separate it into specific tasks and accomplish step by step.\nSince I always tend to set goals that's above my level, I made a grading system for myself. If I have accomplished 80% of my original goal, I would consider I have succeed, and no further works are needed. For those 20% that still might need to be considered, I would put it into my next goal. But the most important thing to me is the quality rather than speed, so I would arrange in advance how long I would spend to ensure the quality of my work, and make adjustment based on real-time situation.\nFor example, I was assigned a task for my research project. My original goal is to finish it by one day before due date, with fully understanding the background and setting up a future plan. Since an abrupt plan occurred, I would finish it still by that day, but I would review more relevant knowledge and set up future plan later.",
            "Question 10": "I have encountered a crisis situation. There were 6 of us in an innovative 3-day project. While most of us focused on our duties and participated often, one of the members didn't contribute at all. She didn't come to team meeting when we were striving for the time limiting project, and when I called her she was at bar and drunk. We allowed her to finish her part the next day, but she still didn't show up. In a mess, we shrunk her part, assigned to each member and finished overnight. When the presentation started on the third day, two of us caught cold and didn't show up. The remaining three of us finished the presentation that should be made by 6 people.\nThis experience taught me a lot; firstly, not all people in the team will co-operate. Now in other projects when I'm leading, I would observe who might become the uncertain variables and assign them easy, winding up tasks so the progress would not be delayed. Secondly, an emergency situation can drive people's potential out but increases uncertainties. We became very energetic at presentation day but each of us made at least one mistake while presenting.",
            "Question 11": "I volunteered in American Red Cross for a year as a client intaker for those who just experienced a disaster. There was a time when I admitted weeping woman, and we cannot communicate well until my leader took the role, and I realized that my role not only about information recording, but also serve as a listener and try not to interrupt when they are expressing their grief. But same thing could be entirely different. I encountered a Christian man who lost his house three times in fire. But he told us he felt so blessed because three fire happened on him and none of them took his life.\nDuring my serving at Red Cross I have witnessed how disasters broke a family and how it brought family members stronger and closer. Now I'm more peaceful to the difficulties in my life cause I know none of them can compare to those poor people who lost their homes. I think even in the future a disaster happened on me, I would accept quicker because I know organizations like Red Cross has tried their best to help me, just like what me and my colleagues do."

I am a person who loves to grow within my career and as an individual, but I also value collaborating and growing with others. Seeing others grow into the best version of themselves is an experience I truly value, but helping others on their journey toward self-actualization is even more powerful. When starting my engineering career, I did not know what makes a good engineer and how my degree would translate into the corporate world. However, I had the pleasure of having friends and successful engineers help me in obtaining opportunities for growth in my field and knowledge. Though there is always more to learn, I want to help engineers who were in my position when I started my civil engineering degree. Mutually helping everyone as a community grow into the best version of themselves and guiding them into the career they want to follow is a belief that I live by. This is why I align well with the pillar of the professional advancement of all engineering students.",
            "Question 9": "When defining success in the goals I set, achieving the desired outcome is a natural factor to consider. However, the outcome does not determine the entire experience. If I did not achieve the desired goal, I reflect on how I approached the situation. While meditating, I focus on how I could have improved my approach, creating alternative methods that could be more effective. I allow myself to accept the situation and give myself grace to learn from my efforts. The experience of learning and growing as an individual is a privilege and success in its own right. If I approach a situation in the most efficient method, I give myself compassion and praise. Sometimes failure is not on the person but on factors that no one can control. As long as they acted with passion, precision, and integrity; there is not much one can do. Experiencing life with purpose is something to be valued, but purpose doesn't equate to perfection. No matter the experience, I believe that life has its ebbs and flows; highs and lows; yet both should be valued. It is also important to reflect on the goals set. Certain goals are good for some, but not healthy for others. It is essential to consider if the goal is best for their well-being. This reflection can strengthen one's commitment, or loosen a concept that might not be beneficial. In summary, the success of my goals comes from my effort and intent.",
            "Question 10": "When reflecting on the experiences that helped me grow in my collaboration with others, I factor in my involvement with NROTC, my fraternity, my internship, and my organizations. However, the most growth came from my expanding understanding of emotional intelligence. This development came from friendships, therapy, and my efforts to connect with others. Emotional intelligence is not a well-promoted skill to college students but is essential to success in a career and lifestyle. Emotional intelligence is impactful on a logical and emotional level. For the emotional factor, understanding and empathizing with others promotes connection and growth between two individuals. For the logical factor, emotional intelligence helps understand where a person can thrive and yield more efficiency. Simple actions such as asking questions help understand the people you interact with personally. For example, I have a strong sense of when a member is not in the right headspace to do a task or fulfill a responsibility. They could be focusing on personal or external factors impacting their life, but I ask questions to see how they are. Afterwards, I request what I can do to help them. I maintain communication yet patience to reassure them that their voice is valuable within the group on a more personal level. Opportunities for understanding and collaboration are essential for improvement and drive within a group or organization. In summary, my strong understanding of emotional intelligence is the foundation of my collaboration skills.",
            "Question 11": "I believe in the continuous service of self and others. I participated in community service events such as street clean-ups, volunteering, and fundraisers. However, my involvement follows the belief of the golden rule: treating others the way that they want to be treated. Though I have served on a larger scale, small actions define the person. From holding the door to showing appreciation, I believe serving others is an everyday way of living. Serving others is a direct reflection of an individual's self-respect and self-confidence. If people are considerate and respectful towards themselves, they can easily translate this effort towards the people we surround and interact with. I want to continue growing and serving others. The service of others on an individual scale is impactful, but serving others as a community is more powerful. I stated that self-respect is a reflection of the treatment of others, but this belief can work vice versa. Learning to serve the public can teach and reinforce the ones involved to treat themselves with the same level of compassion. In summary, I believe service cannot be described in one instance but in a constant behavioral pattern of respect and understanding."

            "Question 9": "Regardless of victory or defeat, my success comes from the lessons I learned along the way in accomplishing my goal and recognizing where I went right or wrong. After my first semester at A&M, I set the goal of hitting 225 pounds on my bench press by the end of the semester. Never having touched a weight in my life and the fact that I\u2019d have to gain 20 pounds to do so, the goal seemed extremely far-fetched. It was only through trial and error in my lifting technique, applying constructive criticism from my experienced weightlifting roommates, my ability to teach myself how to cook, track calories, and undergo a restricted dietary plan that I was able to find incredible success in my fitness journey in just 6 months.

As part of my development into a martial artist and transitioning to black belt, it was my duty to serve the dojo that had taught me so much by teaching others what I had learned. Throughout a 3 year period spanning sophomore year of high school to senior year, I was teaching students of all ages. From children to seniors, I followed the headmaster\u2019s instructions on lesson planning, incorporated my own teaching style to appease the kids and the adults, and learned how to deal with critics from parents and students alike. Teaching others how to defend themselves, giving them confidence in themselves along the way, and watching them all grow as individuals was truly a rewarding experience."

Having the ability to speak one's truth and advocate on behalf of a larger common group is an amazing opportunity I would be able to have being a part of SEC, as it would allow me to build personality based on the values of leadership and trust.

This past year I was able to take the opportunities presented to me to develop as a person with the mere confidence that I built up as I ventured into the countless opportunities within engineering. By staying true to myself and allowing myself to flourish without hesitance, whether this be attending engineering social events or career fairs, I have been able to take more steps into success as a developing engineer.

Getting to work with many people from diverse backgrounds and all ages allowed me to develop perspective in life. Humans often steer clear from associating outside of their defined groups, but by socializing with a variety of unique individuals I was able better operate this experience, and ultimately helped me build personal development. Ranging from an improvement in interactions with others to being able to acquire a variety of skills, working there taught me so much of what I know. Now, I take pride in working in multifaceted opportunities, including the knowledge and people I work with, and having such a fortunate involvement allowed me to open my mind.

As a granddaughter who has constantly admired my grandpa for his diligence, courage, and discipline, I wanted to give back and show him a mere sliver of his kindness by hosting protected social gatherings within the community for all elderly people to interact and feel the joy again. It was a wonderful experience getting to unite friendships that never left during this tough time, and by being able to host more events and ZOOM gatherings, everyone was able to navigate this journey together. I'm glad to have been able to leave my mark; after all, \"alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.\""

A goal I set for myself this year is to be able to deadlift 500lbs by the end of this year. I am at 445lbs right now and I won't stop until I hit 500lbs. I define success as completing the original goal with more than expected effort put into the goal. I worked on a nonstop work mode, whether that be grinding studying at school or personal goals, I see my goals to the end.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was when I was in the Texas A&M engineering academy last year. I was in an ENGR 102 course with a table group of many people. We were assigned to work on a lab as a table group. We began the project to create a python script to translate English into Pig Latin and none of us did not understand how to do the translation code including myself. We all began to do research and worked as a team to gather our ideas to develop the script successfully which we did. After we created the python script we submitted and received a 100 for the assignment. I found that working with others has a massive benefit because when someone struggles, someone else may know what to do which is a benefit of combining bright minds together. In return the person who received help may be able to help someone else in the future if they run into similar problems.",
            "Question 11": "A time when I served others is when I was the Director of Investment Research for a nonprofit organization called the Youth Passion Project. The executive team was assigned with teaching two courses in a summer session period ranging from May to August. I decided I wanted to teach basic algebra 1 skills to the children in my summer session as it would set them to an advantage ahead of other people their ages. I designed well sought out courses for my two algebra 1 sessions in which the children enjoyed the session and even told their parents how well it went. I received various emails from the parents how they appreciated how I went the extra mile and was thinking about their children's future. How I served others in this scenario is by teaching young children basic algebra 1 skills from my own knowledge as well as best inspired the children to put forward their best effort in school to have the best career."

            "Question 8": "Representative Voice allows for the overwhelming number of engineering students an alley for their voices to be heard. The college of engineering is a large part of Texas A&M University, most engineering students might fell like a number, due to the sheer size of the program. SEC allows a chance for those voices to be heard and to make decisions according to the students bodies wants and needs during their time spent on campus and even into their professional careers. Giving a voice to the majority is an important part of making students fell seen and heard, impacting them in a multitude of ways. The student body is what keeps the college of engineering its reason for existing and catering to the needs of the students is want will create engineers that are unparalleled in ability and stand out for the other engineers in the world.",
            "Question 9": "I set a goal to become a starter on my football team in Highschool. I started off by taking a deep dive into myself of what that was going to take to accomplish, first I was going to have to put the work in the weight room and train my speed/agility. In order to reach my goal I had to start for the very bottom of the fundamentals working to build up my body before getting in to the specific of my position on the team as a defensive tackle. Once I had spent a few months during a summer working out, I needed to start with the fundamentals of my position and to learn those to failure day after day, until I have perfected the small steps. The small little steps such a taking the correct step out of my stance or using the right footwork, using the right applications of pressure or knowing where I am supposed be during each play. I worked tirelessly to create a refined product that I could present to my team to be the best possible version of myself on Friday nights. I came into fall camp ready to get to work, all my hard work had paid off as I had won the starting job due to my determination and sheer effort, but it was not until my first game that I would judge my progress, which I had two sacks, that is what success is seeing the fruit of your work.",
            "Question 10": "In Highschool, I particularly was not a fan of group projects as most of the time I would have to do a large majority of the work. My perception on teamwork took a complete 180 this summer with my internship, as I learned that when individuals are determined and focused to achieve one goal, to finish the project, it allows for an unprecedented amount of productive work allowing for a greater, more refined product at the end of the day. It took a profession setting with determined individuals to realize the full potential and productivity that a team brings to the table. Now I believe in team work and more importantly the people that make up the team. You need to trust and instill a belief of determination within the team and they in you, that will lead to a greater collaboration of minds put together to accomplish like-minded goals. My internship was focused on finishing a project and everyone that I worked with understood what it was going to take to finish it. I was able to piggyback off of that determination and become as productive as they pretty quickly. I think all it takes is one determined individual and soon the rest will follow in order to create a team that can accomplish anything thrown their way.",
            "Question 11": "My freshman year at Texas A&M, I was new and did not have very many friends on campus to start. So I went out and joined the Residence Hall Association and it allowed for me to meet new people, but also see the satisfaction of helping others. The volunteer opportunities allowed for me to help not only my peers but those in the community as well. Being able to provide a difference in the world not matter how small or big, allows for growth as a person and to make a better student at the end of the day. The Big Event was an avenue that allowed for me to put aside school and help out some people in the community and felt good to help out someone who could not do the work themselves or was an elderly person that required an able body to accomplish something for them. Serving other people brings a fulfilment to your body and soul, allowing for you to be a better person and student."

This pillar fosters the development of skills, networking opportunities, and hands-on experiences through initiatives like career fairs and corporate engagement, all of which are vital for success in the engineering industry. It also helps me connect with potential employers and grow as a professional.",
            "Question 9": "In the past, I defined success by setting measurable and clear objectives for a particular goal. For example, when I developed a Euros predictor in Python, I defined success by ensuring that the program could accurately predict outcomes based on historical data. Success was measured by the program\u2019s accuracy rate and its ability to handle large datasets without errors. Once the predictor functioned efficiently and produced reliable results, I considered the goal successfully accomplished. This approach helped me focus on outcomes and continuous improvement.",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was when I worked as a Computer Hardware Technician at Reynolds and Reynolds. I was part of a team that handled dealing with complex Dell servers . Initially, I preferred to work alone, but I quickly realized the value of collaborating with others. Each team member had unique strengths, and together we solved problems faster than I could have on my own.

There are not as many opportunities for internships for a prosthetics engineer as there are for other disciplines like aerospace or mechanical, so I believe it is important that I strive to be as professional as possible. This means talking to several different companies in search of internships, regardless of if they deal in prosthetics or not, as well as joining organizations that align with my values and aspirations, which Robomasters and AFL do, as well as SEC of course. I believe that joining the SEC will allow me to develop my professional skills to an extent that any employer would gladly add me to their team.",
            "Question 9": "The most important goal I have recently set for myself was getting accepted into Texas A&M. The goal itself was easy enough to define, but getting there was the hard part. I worked really hard during high school to keep my grades up and stay involved by taking dual credit and AP courses, as well as participating in football, volunteer orgs, and the robotics team. I spent many hours revising and editing my application essays, and I submitted my application as soon as submissions opened up, wanting to be first in line. I was not in the top ten percent of my class, but I knew all of my hard work outside of school would show TAMU how valuable I was as a student. Thankfully, I was right, I got my acceptance notification that December. I have had the best freshman and sophomore years I could have asked for, with my junior year looking bright too, so I'd say that is pretty successful.",
            "Question 10": "In the summer of 2023 I was promoted to the aquatics coordinator position at the YMCA I have worked at for six years now. This allowed me to work with many more people than I ever had before. The part that stood out the most from this past summer would be organizing swim lessons. I worked with upper leadership to create a layout for the lessons, communicated with parents to get their children signed up in the proper sections, created rosters for the instructors and added them to the schedule, and even got in the water several times myself to teach classes. It was a very involved position where I got to meet several people, and I especially loved all of the time I got to spend with upper leadership, watching and learning how they operate a business like the YMCA. I gained a lot of leadership experience in this role, and it showed me how much I enjoy working with people.",
            "Question 11": "I volunteered all throughout high school, whether it be for my Green Cord or for NHS & NTHS (National Technical Honor Society). One place in particular that I loved to volunteer at was a place called Second Glance Resale Store, a Goodwill type store that took in donations and sold them at low prices. I helped out there once every one or two weeks, and my main task was to tag and put clothes out onto the floor. I did it so frequently that I was able to blitz through all the racks of clothes they had prepared for that shift, and I would move on to help elsewhere in the store. I never worked with the same people either, so there was always an opportunity to meet someone new. I'm glad I was able to help out so frequently, as the location I volunteered at was in a low income area, so Second Glance was a much needed establishment. Volunteering there taught me how impactful I can be by lending a hand, even for tasks as simple as putting t-shirts out on a rack."

While I had milestone goals that I was \"successful\" at such as, doing well on chemistry and physics exams, those were things I just simply had to do. I knew that ultimately succeeding would be when I see the email that I have sucessfully etam'ed into biomedical engineering, so in this case I defined succes when I achieved the outcome I desired",
            "Question 10": "An experience that shaped my perspective on working with others was participating in ENGR 216 labs while at the TCC engineering academy, where I learned the importance of delegation. Our college district consisted of five satellite campuses, with each of us attending different ones. We faced several challenges, such as not being able to work together outside of class and being a week behind in lecture material compared to what the lab required. This was due to the TCC physics curriculum not aligning perfectly across the satellite campuses. This made it difficult to complete our work efficiently, especially since the lab was only once a week. To overcome these obstacles we took initiative. I studied the necessary physics concepts in advance since it was easier for me to grasps, given my highschool physics background. My teammate Will, who was strong in programming, handled data interpretation and analysis in Excel, while Brenna acted as a time keeper ensuring we stayed on track. By dividing tasks based on our strengths, we were able to make significant progress on lab day and complete our assignments more efficiently post lab day. This experience was unlike anything I had encountered in high school. It taught me how to delegate tasks and work as a team to ensure progress even under challenging circumstances.",
            "Question 11": "A time I served others was when I helped organize culture nights in middle school. My role involved creating ornaments that represented different cultures to hang in between the roof tiles and on the walls. Since I knew origami back them (forgotten most of it now), I would search for videos on cultural art pieces and follow the tutorials to design them. I also helped moved desk and tables around to prepare for the influx of people who wanted to try different foods from different cultures, and I also participated in the clean up after it was all done the day after. By participating in this event, I helped showcase a variety of cultures, contributing to an atmosphere of openmindedness and inclusivity at my school!"

I don\u2019t believe that any two people can disagree with each other. On a larger scale, the likelihood of a clash is higher, but there always exists a resolution. A huge part of my life I was antisocial for personal reasons. I never once accepted that to be a hindrance to my life goals.\nI am currently an IEEE officer and leading a robotics team.

            "Question 9": "Every goal I accomplish leaves me feeling complacent.\nI learned to dunk over the summer. My favorite aspect of fitness is finishing goals that come from consistent training. In highschool I was an athlete, but not in basketball. I stand around average height so dunking a basketball on a 10 foot rim did not come naturally to me.\nBefore I could practice dunking with perfect form I had to increase my vertical jump from 35\u2019\u2019 to 42\u2019\u2019. I made a routine that conditioned my legs to handle daily workouts. I greatly enjoyed picking the best exercises to track my progress. After 2 months I could dunk. I streamlined my training for the rest of the summer to prioritize my dunking form over leg strengthening.\nIt was a successful completion yet I didn't feel satisfied. I learned a couple years ago that instead of convincing myself the job is completed, it\u2019s more fun to find new jobs that peak my interest. I am currently training to windmill dunk, a much more difficult achievement.\nSuccess is self-acknowledgement of accomplishments in smaller goals. As I live my life, my goals will change as I build upon them to reach success.",
            "Question 10": "My most memorable collaborative experience was during my public policy internship at the City of Austin. My internship was legislation within the Austin Police Department. We worked in a team throughout the semester, later concluding with presentations to officials within the department.\nI volunteered to lead our team of 5 other interns. The high stakes associated with taking the position made me feel regretful. Since I couldn\u2019t back out, I spent the summer learning how to best work with my team.\nI was used to getting only my portion of work done, a bad habit I got from annoying group projects in highschools. I broadened my focus on what our group can accomplish. In the process we all became good friends. I overlooked friendship but that served to be the most integral part of working with them. Now that I knew them personally, everyone\u2019s roles stood out, making assigning tasks simpler. My biggest take away was mixing informality in professional settings to boost group morale.",

While representing and spreading awareness of engineering is important in the growth of the field, professionalism is what gives engineering the notoriety it has as a pillar of the future. Professionalism develops engineers to where they will be able to understand their position in the business and prosper in that position. As I develop into an engineer, professionalism will play a big role in how I\u2019m able to differentiate myself from other engineers who may not understand how impactful this pillar can be. As engineering grows, the advancement of professionalism will dictate how everyone will take their stance on the field of engineering.",
            "Question 9": "One goal that I had set for myself in my younger days was to converse with my parents at least once a week. While it may sound like an arbitrary goal, I realized that my parents were on the older side balancing their jobs and health, and might not be able to meet with them often 20 or 30 years from then. Before this thought, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d held a full conversation with any of them, so I would then set a goal to force myself to converse with them at least once a week. Every week, I would go to them and talk about anything that came to my mind.

They decided to put the students in random groups with people they didn\u2019t know well so that we would get experience working as a collaborative group. From this, I had to adapt to every one of my group members\u2019 personalities from the rowdy to the quiet. This experience allowed me to develop a mind to put everyone\u2019s strengths to good use and collaborate with them to end in a product that had all our hands on it.",
            "Question 11": "Every year in my high school, the school would put on a talent show for the students. Starting from my junior year, I was on the committee to help organize the event. On the committee, I\u2019ve done various tasks such as being an usher in my junior year. As an usher, a group of us were responsible for guiding teachers and students to their designated seats in the auditorium. I met a lot of interesting personalities whilst doing my job from the cranky to the \u201cuneducated\u201d. Even through these bumps, I kept a straight face and completed the job to the best of my abilities. After the show ended, we opened the door of the auditorium and thanked everyone there as they were leaving. While most ignored us, what made everything worthwhile was the gratitude for the show from some of the teachers and my friends who were in attendance. Just knowing that I did a fine job from someone other than myself gave me a boost of confidence in attending and helping in more events from the school."
