            "Question 8": "The mission to foster the professional advancement of engineering students deeply resonates with me. As a CPSC student, I see a stark gap between our education and the rapid-evolution of demands in the industry, like React and Spring. Moreover, the reliance on paper-based exams does little to prepare us for the practical aspects of tech roles, where testing and debugging skills are paramount. Therefore, I propose engaging with faculty to update our courses and assessment methods, reflecting current tech demands. Organizing more speaker events with industry leaders could offer insights into essential skills, while a mentorship program with Aggie alumni would provide real-world perspectives. Additionally, creating a resource webpage for self-learning the latest tech stacks could empower students to adapt and thrive in the ever-changing tech landscape. Those steps would support SEC's mission in equipping students with skills and knowledge to meet the challenges and opportunities of the industry.",
            "Question 9": "Incorporating my passion for helping others into my long-term professional goals is intertwined with my current research in the application of machine learning to computer 3D vision.This experience has shown me the transformative power of AI in solving complex models. This research is driven by a personal mission. My father, a Vietnam War veteran, suffers from PTSD, a condition that went untreated in its early stages because PTSD wasn\u2019t recognized by the military until the 1980s. My goal is to leverage the capabilities of machine learning to improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosing PTSD and other psychological disorders. This goal extends to a broader mission: enhancing the well-being of individuals facing mental health challenges, including engineering students: often overwhelmed by the rigors of their coursework and future aspirations, they are susceptible to stress and related disorders.\nBy contributing to the SEC, I aim to not only advance our professional capabilities but also to advocate for mental health awareness and support within our community. This dual focus aligns with our common target, enriching the engineering student experience while preparing us to tackle societal challenges with empathy and innovation. As an engineer, there is no greater honor than using one's abilities for the greater good. In SEC, I hope to foster an environment where we, as future engineers, are not just technically proficient but also socially conscious and driven to use our skills to make a meaningful difference in the world.",
            "Question 10": "Pursuing an honorable discharge upgrade for my step-father, a USMC veteran, was a personal mission. This task, seemingly small as a minor amendment of a document, was monumental due to the dignity it would restore to his service. My father's silent battle against PTSD in Vietnam adversely affected his performance, resulting in a general discharge which fails to reflect his true sacrifice.\nWithout the means for a lawyer, I embarked on this complex process alone to right the wrong and engaged in countless hours of research understanding PTSD and the intricacies of the discharge upgrade process. The path was fraught with challenges. Communication with various agencies for necessary documents was a painstaking process, punctuated by long waits and impending deadlines. The most poignant task was to extract coherent narratives from my step-father's fragmented memories, a task that demanded not only patience but profound empathy. Our conversations, though difficult, were crucial in unearthing personal stories and service details to strengthen our case.\nDespite these challenges, my determination never wavered. I pressed on to honor my father's sacrifice. The eventual success in achieving the discharge upgrade, although symbolically modest, was a testament to my commitment to what I hold important and meaningful."

There are so many brilliant people who have the potential to make incredible contributions to the world, but are never given the chance. I saw this firsthand when I taught elementary school classes to underserved students for a month during my last two years of high school. My time there made me realize that everyone is born with innate gifts, but not everyone is given the opportunity to nurture them. I loved being able to help my students grow by encouraging them to pursue their lofty aspirations, and doing whatever I could to support them along the way. In the SEC, I want to continue increasing engineering awareness, especially in younger students. I know that through events like the Envision Conference, I\u2019ll be able to help the SEC nurture the engineering dreams of countless students.",
            "Question 9": "Sometimes, being an engineering student feels like I\u2019m always focused on getting that next internship, getting that good research position, and then hopefully getting that high paying job at some big tech corporation. However, when I take a step back to think about what I\u2019ll truly value at the end of my professional career, it won\u2019t be where I worked or how many research articles I wrote. What will matter most to me is whether or not I was able to help aspiring engineers in the same way that so many people have helped me. There\u2019s nothing I want to achieve more than working my way to a position where I\u2019m able to give back everything I\u2019ve learned to support future engineers with their own goals.\nI think that the mission of the SEC perfectly aligns with what I want to do professionally. As a member of the SEC, I\u2019ll help support the engineering goals of both younger students and my peers in the COE. In addition to the Envision Conference, I\u2019m excited to hopefully work on the career fair so that all students in the COE can have the opportunity to advance their careers, while also learning more about industry jobs for their respective majors. I know that joining the SEC will help me get some great experience with developing future engineers, while also feeling like meaningful work that I\u2019ll enjoy doing. I can\u2019t wait to contribute to the SEC\u2019s mission while working towards my own professional goals.",
            "Question 10": "The time is 4:30 AM. I roll out the bed and hope my months of hard work will finally pay off. Seven hours later and it\u2019s all over. Another release where my automation software doesn\u2019t work. During the pandemic I decided to start a business that used software to purchase limited collectibles to sell on secondary marketplaces. At first, I poured in my time and money without a second thought. As the months wore on without any success, I found myself struggling to stay motivated. I began to feel burned out before realizing that something needed to change.\nWhat ended up changing was my source of motivation. Rather than being driven solely by results, I learned to simply enjoy the process of working and slowly improving. I know this mindset will be especially valuable when it comes to working on the career fair, as I\u2019ll have to send countless emails without receiving replies in addition to months of prep for only three days. Learning to be process driven has helped me overcome many challenges, and I know it will help me with the demand of being an active member of the SEC."

I come from a smaller city out west where very few people even dream of leaving the area for college, much less going to a big university to study engineering with plans of building rockets that will fly to the moon. Programs to introduce K -12 students to engineering deeply impacted my choice to take the leap and come to Texas A&M to pursue my dreams. I am particularly interested in the EnVision conference, as it would allow me to work with high schoolers and pursue this passion. As part of SEC, I plan to do what was done for me and expose K-12 students to the world of engineering. I want to give these students the knowledge and resources that were critical for me and \u201creturn the favor\u201d of helping young students pursue their dreams.",
            "Question 9": "My goal is to be a project manager in the aerospace industry. Through this career, I will have repeated opportunities to present to young children and show them that anyone can be an engineer. My passion is helping young students make connections and get information to succeed. Students often struggle to pursue their dreams because of a lack of access to the knowledge of their peers. Whether this is a middle schooler not knowing they could participate in STEM competitions, a high schooler needing clarification about college admissions, or a college student searching for help with professional development, there are so many future engineers that could be incredibly successful if given the resources.\nThis passion directly correlates to two of the pillars of SEC: increasing engineering awareness and fostering professional advancement. My drive to help others access resources will propel me to support students who have yet to advance to the collegiate level and assist our own Aggie Engineers with pursuing their career goals via programs like the career fair and professional development programs.\nGiving back by working with the SEC in this manner will also help me further my own professional goals. Through the SEC, I will be able to work with a large variety of people with diverse opinions and perspectives, a vital skill for a project manager. As part of SEC, I will be able to both help others and grow myself.",
            "Question 10": "I come from a tiny K-12 school with a close-knit community. In the 8th grade, my school was at risk of closure due to a lack of funding. This seemed like an insurmountable obstacle. What could I do to fight the all-powerful administrators? After reeling from the initial shock, I decided to write a petition. The chances of this succeeding were next-to-none, but I couldn\u2019t sit down and watch as the community I loved crumbled around me. I drafted the petition and shared it online. Everyone around me told me my little petition was useless, but I stood firm. Something had to be done. Soon enough, my petition circulated online and had over 2000 signatures. I planned to present this at the open forum after the meeting on the school closure, but much to my chagrin, there was no open forum. Instead of letting this be the end of my efforts, I walked straight up to the administrator and presented my petition during her meeting. My little petition managed to forestall the school closure and buy time to get more funding. My tenacity led to direct action, and I realized the importance of persisting in the face of immense difficulty."

My passion lies in breaking down socio-economic barriers for kids in lesser privileged areas, as I was able to connect with an all-girls orphanage in India this past summer and provide them tools and kits for creative problem-solving and innovation. The girls\u2019 excitement at their discoveries and the overall experience left a lasting impression, and inspired me to get involved in specific initiatives such as the SEC\u2019s Envision Scholars program and conference. They align with my advocating for diversity and inclusivity within the field as a minority female to underrepresented populations. I am excited to bring my love and passion for the engineering field to communities in the greater Bryan/College Station area and beyond, as the prospect of making a lasting impact fuels my commitment to this mission.",
            "Question 9": "In my future career, I aspire to blend my passion for helping others and the medical field with engineering skills to embody the role of an orthopedic physicianeer. This includes addressing critical challenges such as developing advanced biomaterials for tissue regeneration, improving orthopedic implants, and enhancing drug delivery systems. By bringing a rigorous engineering mindset to the medical field, I aspire to pioneer solutions that address not only current healthcare issues but also anticipate and mitigate future challenges.\nAs a representative voice dedicated to increasing engineering awareness with the SEC at Texas A&M, I am committed to fostering collaboration between engineers and other disciplines.

            "Question 10": "Throughout my academic career, I demonstrated commitment beyond the classroom with my involvement in a neuroscience research lab as a freshman. The obstacles were diverse, ranging from meticulously researching and cold-emailing over 80 professors to later complicated lab responsibilities. I adopted a multifaceted approach, organizing my schedule to allocate time for research work along with balancing a rigorous course load and extracurriculars. The complexity of the projects themselves proved another hurdle, which I addressed by seeking guidance from senior lab members and professors. Speaking up and asking questions during scheduled meetings and discussions were integral to clarifying intricate concepts, refining my overall understanding of the projects. Moreover, unforeseen setbacks, such as analysis equipment malfunctions and image data discrepancies, required timely adaptability and critical thinking. In response to such situations, I developed contingency plans, proving resilient in the face of challenges. Despite these setbacks, my commitment to the lab and dedication to my team remained resolute. I embraced the opportunity for personal and intellectual growth, recognizing that overcoming obstacles was an inherent part of meaningful research. This experience not only strengthened my resolve but also honed my problem-solving skills, making me more adept at navigating challenges outside the traditional academic setting."

One main reason that engineering students attend a top university like Texas A&M is to obtain a job that meets their desires after college. In order to obtain this \u201cdream job\u201d, students need to learn how to take the skills learned in the classroom and apply them to real world situations. However, they also need to learn other beneficial skills for the work environment such as effective communication, time management, and public speaking. As the Vice President of my Senior Class I learned how to effectively collaborate with my team when solving problems and communicate with the entire student body when giving speeches at class assemblies. I understand the importance of continual professional development and wish to help promote this advancement in all engineering students at TAMU.",
            "Question 9": "Professionally, I want to become a mechanical engineer focused on giving back to the community. Specifically, I want to design a product or process focused on improving the quality of life of humans, possibly by improving the design of hospitals to increase the efficiency that doctors operate, allowing for more people to be treated and saved each day. Additionally, I want to give back to the next generation of engineers. I have been lucky enough to receive help from engineers in the form of great professors, minor scholarships, and lifelong mentors. I hope to be able to one day give back to the community and pay forward by providing mentorship and financial assistance to the bright minds of the future. Within the SEC, I hope to have the opportunity to start the idea of giving back to the community. Specifically, in regard to fostering professional development, I want to work on events such as the Career Fairs, Industry Nights, and DI Saturdays that open the eyes of students to an endless number of doors in their future.

            "Question 10": "In July 2022, I participated in a church mission trip where in five days, the goal was to build wheelchair ramps for families that desperately needed them. Each group was given a specific ramp outline of the final expected product. After the first two and a half days of working efficiently in the sun, my group had built the entire wheelchair outline, frame, and structure. We were about 60% done with the job. As we were taking a lunch break, the supervisor of our worksite pulled up to inspect our ramp and check our progress. Dreadfully, he told us our framing used a different size support than required, so we had to start the entire project over. With only two and half days left, it seemed impossible. However, I took the lead, offering encouragement and giving advice on how we should proceed. The next two days were stressful as we were behind schedule. Through diligence, perseverance, and most importantly the teamwork and collaboration of the group, we finished the project half a day early. From this ramp building experience, I learned the value of communication and teamwork in situations where roadblocks need to be overcome."

The original answer was $400: roughly the cost of an encyclopedia. While the world has moved past encyclopedias, the punchline still rings truer than ever. A solid academic foundation is only one part of an engineer's knowledge. Those wishing to stand out must also bring developed soft skills, unique experiences, and an elevated sense of professionalism. Thus, the SEC pillar that speaks the most to me is professional advancement. Events such as the career fair have given me the opportunity to refine invaluable networking skills and seek out enriching work experiences. Aggies are already well-equipped in the classroom, but these important development programs help to ensure students are well-rounded and set up for success outside of the classroom and post-graduation.",
            "Question 9": "As a woman in a major with one of the greatest gender disparities, there have been times when I\u2019ve felt intimidated and insecure despite a record of academic excellence. Thus, one of my long-term goals is to help shift the culture and ensure the next generation of women doesn\u2019t feel this as they look around their classrooms. This is done by encouraging more young women to enter the field and providing them with the knowledge and resources to do so with success. I have always enjoyed sharing my stories of success and shortcomings to guide those younger than me, from being FLO staff to volunteering with kindergarteners at church to tutoring high school math. In my professional career, I plan to use my industry experience to continue with mentorship programs. I would also love to reach a point in my career where I can readily provide financial resources for other young women to pursue education in engineering. Finally, it has always been my plan to spend a few years teaching once I have fulfilled my calling as a professional engineer. Seeing the advantages I had coming into college with a strong academic foundation has further inspired me to try and give the same advantages to others. These goals align with the mission of the SEC to spread engineering awareness, particularly to an underrepresented demographic group. In the future, I Envision a world where anyone can see a future for themselves in engineering and is prepared to go and achieve it.",
            "Question 10": "Over the past two years, I have worked to organize hygiene product donation drives for young refugee students in Houston. This year, however, brought major unexpected challenges. The school district takeover in Houston ended long-established access to beneficiary populations while the restructuring of our main source of funding left us with essentially no money. Thus, with weakened communication, no funds, and a dwindling clock, it would have been very easy to scrap the project altogether. However, I remembered this was not a self-interested commitment but one made to a community truly in need, and this drove the motivation to finish what was started. With such limited resources, the only way to do so was to be relentless and resourceful in all aspects. Dozens of calls to other community centers were made until they were answered, permits for donation boxes were resubmitted until they were approved, and far too long was spent digging in storage until reusable materials were found. After six months and over one hundred emails later, this unyielding determination finally revealed a path. Although things did not go as originally planned, I am beyond excited to finally see donations in deserving hands at the end of the month."

            "Question 9": "A few years ago, I attended the J.P. Morgan Chase GenerationTech event. In this event, we worked in teams to use technology in order to help solve a U.N. Global Goal. Tasked with the global goal of quality education, my team and I created a teaching aid tool that provides teaching resources and qualifications in locations where the value of education is minimal. Through hearing numerous other innovative solutions, I realized that I could make these ideas viable and help society.\nOne of my long-term professional goals is to develop technology that will help aid in ones\u2019 everyday life. That can be through working for a social impact company or implementing some of my own ideas. For example, I want to create a mental health tool that will allow people to easily connect with help groups nearby and track their personal well being.\nThese professional and personal aspirations seem to contribute seamlessly with the mission of SEC. My goal of using technology to help simplify processes can be achieved as I could contribute to SEC my data analytics, software development, and technology skills. I hope to become a project manager within systems administration to assist committees while refining my skills. For example, I could help write scripts that can help better manage attendance and participation and note trends in event participation. Additionally, in events like Envision, technology use can be even more optimized and programs can be developed to help foster a great STEM experience among the attendees.",

By the end of the semester, we had cleaned up the user interface, implemented bus data, and had a feasible application that we planned to release at the beginning of the spring semester. However, that was when we faced a major roadblock. The university had completely changed the data we used to generate our application. With a planned release within a month, we had to change key components of our application as fast as possible.\nAfter facing our problem, I immediately planned a week by week task list to be on time for our planned release. By delegating tasks and sections to our team with deadlines, we were able to fix the issue we faced. Through deadlines and weekly meetings, everyone was even more motivated as it became a group endeavor.

            "Question 10": "Growing up and through high school I played competitive volleyball. I logged thousands of hours in the gym and was taught so much by great coaches. Last year, I was the head coach of an 11-u volleyball team. My goal for the season was to develop my team into skilled players and encouraging teammates. This was quite the challenge with 12 middle school girls who knew almost nothing about the game and had short attention spans. Even though I knew it would be challenging, there was nothing I wanted more than to see these young players succeed and pass on the knowledge of volleyball I have. Every week I came to practice and committed myself to leading by example, being patient with them, encouraging, and still maintaining firm boundaries. I constantly gave my players positive affirmations and encouraged them to improve individually and as a team. They started the season losing every set, barely able to earn a point. Through a lot of hard work, week after week, they found themselves winning against seasoned teams, and being each other's biggest fans. Since last season, many of them went on to earn spots on competitive teams."

All this has played a large role in my success early on.\nHowever, the reason I have this is because neither of my parents did. They came from a small town where the only engineers were train operators. My dad almost failed out of college and struggled with involvement because no one helped him. Without opportunity at home, it made college much harder for him.\nI want to do for other students what my parents did for me. Through engineers\u2019 week and special events committee, I want to help bring resources to every student, so they are given every opportunity to make the most of their time here, no matter where they are from.",
            "Question 9": "Artificial limbs. Phone cameras. Water filters, smoke detectors, modern computers. All these crucial inventions were created to explore space, then adapted to terrestrial applications.\nA lot of people hear about research in space and assume it isn\u2019t helpful to people on earth, but that isn\u2019t true. My passion is space exploration. Right now, humans are returning to the moon and A&M is building a space institute by my house; it\u2019s a great time to be a part of this industry. I want to be a part of these technological advancements because of the impact they\u2019ll have on earth. Medical solutions and robots created for space could have a positive impact on millions of people back on earth. Specifically, I think a lot of it has the potential to change how developing countries approach challenging issues. But multi-disciplinary collaboration is a necessity for this level of innovation. My goal as a part of this industry is to make it accessible to everyone, and to help pioneer technology to help humans in space and on earth.\nThis influences my goals of increasing engineering awareness at TAMU through SEC. By increasing engineering awareness, the space industry becomes more approachable for hundreds of students. Instead of scaring people by saying it\u2019s impossible rocket science, showing the multifaceted side and providing opportunities at events like career fair, can let engineering students (and other disciplines) understand there is a place for all industries and majors in this industry. Then they can change the world too.",
            "Question 10": "Last summer I got the chance to intern at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center. One of the projects in my office was creating a new process for sharing data with industry partners. My boss was too busy to work on it, so she shared over a hundred slides and pages with me of important NASA people\u2019s opinions. And then told me to write it by myself.\nI was overwhelmed, but I found a spot, put on music, and focused. I read through all the documents, took notes, and cross-referenced them. I made video calls with data representatives to ask about necessities. I researched data security standards until I was the office\u2019s expert. With no precedence for anything, I made clarifications, question documents, notes about notes. I wrote an initial process, ran it by a colleague, then revised and wrote more notes. I used every resource, and 48 hours later I submitted everything. One month ago, my boss reached out and said they presented my material to the center\u2019s director, with my name still on it. I learned the hard way the importance of asking for help, breaking problems down, and never giving up, but in the end, I achieved my goal."

            "Question 9": "As an aspiring control systems engineer with a deep-rooted passion for helping others, I envision integrating this commitment into my long-term professional goals by focusing on mentorship. My role as a Student Ambassador for the Department of Electrical Engineering has not only honed my technical skills but also underscored the importance of guiding and inspiring underclassmen. My experience in tutoring cadets through the O.R. Simpson Honor Society has been instrumental in shaping my approach to mentorship. I provide weekly tutoring sessions for courses I have previously excelled in, offering this service free of charge. This has not only allowed me to refine my understanding but also to develop a keen sense of the challenges faced by students in these areas. I believe that by sharing my knowledge and experiences, I can help others overcome similar obstacles, fostering a culture of collective growth and learning. I plan to extend this mentorship beyond the classroom, targeting the third pillar of the Student Engineers' Council (SEC) \u2013 professional advancement. Incorporating these experiences into my role within the SEC, I aim to organize workshops, speaker series, and networking events such as the Texas Engineers' Summit which had such a huge impact on me. Ultimately, my goal is to create a supportive environment where aspiring engineers can thrive, both academically and professionally. By aligning my passion for helping others with the mission of the SEC, I believe we can cultivate a community of well-rounded, skilled engineers ready to tackle the challenges of the future.",
            "Question 10": "When I joined the Corps initially, I faced a significant challenge: my physical fitness was not at its peak, a concern that likely motivated my father to enroll me. Initially, I struggled with the high demands of physical training and failed the mock Physical Fitness Test (PFT). Thankfully, this was just a trial and I had months before the actual PFT.\nIn the ensuing months, I committed myself to improving my physical condition. This involved frequent gym visits, running 10 miles weekly, and balancing these efforts with academic responsibilities/Corps activities. My determination extended to joining the Fish Drill Team (FDT), a prestigious and challenging commitment for any freshman in the Corps. This required returning early from winter break to engage in nine hours of daily military drill practice. Looking back on it, I had some rough times but I am confident it was the best decision of my life. One thing that helped me stay focused and dedicated was the support of my buddies around me. They believed in me more than I did. I came out of FDT a much stronger human being and finally passed the PFT in Spring to cement my place in the Corps."

When given the opportunity to choose a project this semester, I decided that it would be beneficial to engineering students to improve the freshman engineering experience. I am passionate about serving my peers and believe being a representative voice is the perfect way to do so. Part of my role in this project is first, listening to the opinions of my peers, next, brainstorming possible solutions to these issues that would benefit TAMU engineering students as a whole, and lastly, meeting with advisors to make the voice of engineering students heard. I\u2019m excited to see the impact that this project will have on the engineering experience, and I\u2019d love to continue making the voice of engineering students heard and represented at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 9": "Service is something that I am extremely passionate about. This past summer I participated in a service program (work crew) where I served for 5 weeks in Colorado. Serving the families that came to summer camp each week impacted me by showing me the true reason for service. Lots of the work I was doing over the summer was behind the scenes-either doing dishes, cleaning bathrooms, or even landscaping. Although this work mostly went unnoticed, it taught me that we do not serve to receive recognition from others, but for the impact we can make on others\u2019 lives. Although it was a challenging experience, this service taught me that the little things make a big difference, even if you do not see it firsthand. Through service, you can create unique experiences for people to feel loved and cared for. I can see this being played in my professional goals because one of my purposes is to make others feel loved and encouraged wherever I am placed. Whether that is in a professional or social environment, I believe helping others should always be on the forefront of my mind. Helping others is not a part-time trait and I will incorporate this skill wherever I end up in the future. By doing so, I can contribute to the mission of the Student Engineers\u2019 Council by fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students within the College of Engineering by wanting what is best for all engineering students at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 10": "Entering into my freshman year of high school, I had decided to try out for my school\u2019s drill team with zero dance experience. I had less than a year to prepare for something completely new which was a huge challenge. I took classes, practiced daily, and watched many YouTube videos in order to catch up to the girls who had danced their entire lives. Although I made the team, I felt so far behind the other girls and didn\u2019t make the elite team like my friends. Although I was supportive of my friends who did make the elite team, my goal was to be dancing alongside them. This failure gave me all the motivation to work even harder my freshman year. I spent my time taking even more classes and staying late after practice to improve. I grew exponentially my freshman year, and not only did I make the elite team my sophomore year, but I was given a leadership position. Although it was hard to receive the news that I did not make the elite team, I did not let this failure hold me back, but used it as a catalyst for growth in my dance skills and resilience."

My first week at school, I attended a scholarship ceremony that featured a very successful student speaker who gave out his contact information in his speech. After emailing him, the student met with me, giving me advice for over an hour. Since, I have reached out to other upperclassmen for advice on different classes and organizations and have not been turned down once. Each of them were happy to help and showed a genuine interest in my success. Advancing students professionally through SEC resonates with me because it is a medium to give back to the university that has embraced me while also expanding that culture to industry so that those beyond A&M can feel the warmth and inclusion its graduates have to offer.",
            "Question 9": "As a member of the service committee for Progressively Reaching Excellence and Professionalism (PREP), I was tasked with finding a Fall philanthropy event. After previous experience with Camp Courage, an event for the mentally disabled, I had strong interest in Dash for Down Syndrome (DDS), a fun run for down syndrome awareness in Bryan. I reached out to the event coordinators and was able to supply volunteers to help set up and run the event. During the function, I was a liaison between the event organizers and my organization\u2019s volunteers. The value of the event was apparent in the joy that the participants of DDS demonstrated. This event stuck out to me because those with certain disabilities are often overlooked in our society. Similarly, in the professional world, I am currently interested in the geothermal and tidal energy industries as they are often overlooked in the alternative energy sphere. This means they have much more room to grow. My ultimate professional goal is to enter into an overlooked industry that has potential to grow so that I can play an outsized role in expanding it in a way tailored to the public good. This can contribute to SEC\u2019s mission because I am passionate about expanding the network of A&M engineers to domains which may have been neglected in the past. Expanding to a wider reach of industries allows for a variety of opportunities for professional advancement, giving students a choice to fully express their voices through their professional decisions.",
            "Question 10": "My 2023 New Years Resolution was to read and reflect on more books. I wanted to find a way to learn from what I had read. While looking at a website a teacher had made, I got the idea to make my own website where I would write out thoughts on the books I read. I found a free website maker and was able to easily create a format in which I wrote about the things I liked/disliked and the lessons I had learned. Originally, I wanted to make something that looked aesthetic but was also functional. However, I quickly realized that doing too much designing could look too busy and distract from the actual material of the website. I switched the primary colors of the website to black and white while also blurring the backgrounds of individual pages to create a professional look that focused on the actual content. Additionally, I overhauled the structure, creating different tabs and giving each book review a specific page. Constantly looking to improve, in 2024, I decided on a new format of reviewing that focuses more on the notes I had taken and lessons learned than a summary of the books themselves.\nhttps://reidzepeda.wixsite.com/mysite"

Engineers are behind most of the life-changing technological advancements of the 20th and 21st century. However, only 22% percent of engineering students are female. As I look around my 200\u2019s and 300\u2019s level classes, the percentage of women in those classes plummets in comparison to my 100\u2019s level classes. This gets even worse in the workforce as women only comprise 13.7 % of the global engineering workforce. To help improve these statistics, we need to push engineering awareness, educate young children on the vast field of engineering, and provide mentorship to future innovators so that in the future when students look around them they can see other students just like them.",
            "Question 9": "As an aspiring computer engineer, I want to leverage robotics and AI to design creative solutions to issues affecting communities across the globe such as limited access to clean water, food, and healthcare in order to improve the quality of life and living conditions around the world. One of the projects I hope to work on in the future is a AI that doctors can use to create individualized medication for each patient using DNA while decreasing the cost of healthcare so that it is more effective and affordable.\nI can collaborate with other SEC members to organize outreach events that promote engineering awareness and education among younger generations. Passion is contagious. Through our passion for engineering and its potential to do good across the globe, we can inspire a generation of community-driven engineers who aspire to address some of the global challenges that millions of people face on a daily basis. While engineering is difficult and our days are longer than most, it can be one of the most rewarding majors. I hope to show everyone that engineering is for everyone and is an amazing field where we can bring our imaginations to life and change the world one byte at a time through SEC events such as the Envision conference and E-week. We can incorporate hands-on workshops where we introduce people to the different fields as so many fields of engineering remain a mystery to most such as data engineering and mechatronics.",

Despite getting 1st at regionals in one of the most competitive regions, we were knocked out in the first round of the state competition. Although upset, we did not let it keep us down for too long. The next year, we were determined to make it on the national stage. We got to work the day the new prompts came out. To put our best foot forward, we finished our final project 2 weeks before the first round of competitions so that we could get feedback from our mentors. After each level of competition, we continued to improve our project and research more about current events impacting the economy so that we were \u201cexperts\u201d on our topic and could give insightful responses to our judge\u2019s questions. After countless hours of research, planning, and practice and a couple all-nighters while managing sports, school, and other activities, we ended our senior year with a bang. We got 2nd on the national stage in several events. If given the opportunity to serve SEC, I will bring this same work ethic and dedication to spread engineering awareness among younger generations."

I cultured lung cells, experimented on them with glucose-dependent and time-dependent plans, and injected fluorescent probes for imaging. But with the death of my cells, it seemed my grit had amounted to nothing. Even though it remained necessary, grinding away wasn\u2019t enough. I learned to rely on those around me, requesting labmates Avery and Sanchi demonstrate their culture techniques or asking Dr. Jothi Sivapackiam for explanations behind the biochemistry of pulmonary fibrosis when a paper wasn\u2019t enough.

            "Question 9": "For a while, I feared I would have to forgo my morals to work at an engineering corporation such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Northrop Grumman, until a conversation with my principal investigator during my Precise Advanced Technologies and Healthcare Solutions for Underserved Populations (PATHS-UP) Young Scholars internship. Discussing the aviation industry and space travel, Dr. Cote highlighted the absence of monitoring systems for pilot and crew compared to the abundance of sensors monitoring the craft itself. He guided me in pairing my passions for aerospace and biomedical engineering to develop space medicine technologies, potentially improving the quality of life of people globally. These technologies are lightweight and portable by nature, so when manufactured cheaply, would alleviate healthcare disparities and inequities. If I do not work for a major aerospace firm, I plan to develop such space-age healthcare technologies as an entrepreneur, because it is unjust to see these communities taken advantage of with the ability to affect positive change as an engineer. This perspective would further the efforts of the Student Engineers\u2019 Council in two major ways. First, I would love nothing more than to serve my peers at the University level, passionately catalyzing positive change I have the privilege to observe in my community. Second, drawing on my experience wanting to make a career out of such an unorthodox combination, I hope to present opportunities to my peers to explore such discipline crossovers and spark their curiosity and passion just as Dr. Cote helped to spark mine.",

Naturally, it was difficult to begin such a daunting project knowing next to nothing, but our industry professional advisor helped me divide the task into more manageable portions and delegate tasks to my teammates. Towards the end of the week, as the days on end of ten-hour workdays caught up to us, our passions propelled us to the finish line. By this time, we were completely dedicated to our design and we wanted to continue learning as much as we could from the NASA engineer who had already taught us so much.

            "Question 8": "\"But, what does an engineer even do?\" This was always the question that followed after I told my friends that my dad was an engineer, and for a long time, I didn't know the answer to it. Engineering is a mystery to children because it is such a broad field, stemming from software development to building bridges. This is why SEC's mission statement of increasing engineering awareness resonates deeply with me. The world is never going to stop needing engineers, and it is our role to educate future generations about the field. Opening that door for young people would not only mean an increase in students following the STEM route but also enrolling in college. Making these children aware of their opportunities, and encouraging them to make the most of them, leaves a positive impact on their lives and allows them to positively impact others in the future.",
            "Question 9": "Once my academic journey in Aggieland comes to an end, I aspire to open a construction company. I plan on using my company to build temporary housing for recently migrated families. This is a cause that sympathizes with me because not too long ago my family migrated to the United States. By providing temporary housing for these families, they won't have to worry about paying rent while they're getting settled and looking for a source of income. Giving to others provides oneself with a sense of purpose. What good is it to have wealth if not to use it as leverage to help others? All three areas of the Student Engineers' Council's mission statement revolve around serving others and this is the main attracting factor for me filling out this application. In high school, I was part of an organization named HUSL in which I coached children from low-income families in basketball and soccer. However, the purpose of the organization wasn't sports, it was keeping the kids on the right track. I see the same purpose rooted in SEC's pillars. It is difficult to seek out help because of the stigma that asking for help shows weakness. That is why it's important to reach out to others and meet them halfway. Through events like Engineers' Week, SEC makes help readily available for struggling students and reminds them that it is okay to not be okay. This is a purpose I want to be a part of.",

I decided to find an SAT teacher and told him my goal was to get a 1500 in the next SAT, which was in a month. He looked at my old scores, told me to go home, reflect on my goal, and come up with a realistic one. I studied every single day leading up to the test, doing hundreds of practice problems a week. I took the exam and got a 1460. I was excited to see the fruits of my work, but I still hadn't achieved my goal. I spent my time mastering the math section of the exam and took it once more.

            "Question 10": "Teaching coding to a kid who doesn\u2019t know how to read seemed improbable, until I met Frank. Working at iCode, I was tasked with instructing a group of children, including Frank, on introductory programming.. While his peers tackled programming, Frank sat idle; so I began to ask him to identify parts of the code, but he just stared blankly at the screen. That's when I realized Frank couldn\u2019t read. As a code instructor, and not an English teacher, I had to plan how to teach Frank to read. I began by having Frank write the alphabet. Eventually, he managed to write all twenty-six letters, and soon after basic words. I continued until he was able to read enough to understand the curriculum, and I could see from the excitement in his eyes that he was understanding it. Although I was his instructor, Frank taught me a valuable lesson. Thanks to my experience with Frank, I apply similar techniques to help those struggling with new topics. I try to understand the root cause and coach through challenging topics with empathy and logic. Every topic has its own ABCs that needs to be conquered before facing the next step."

The most impactful moments in any job I\u2019ve had is when my coworkers patiently have taught new skills and how to spread positivity. Because of their positive impact I would like to extend those values in everywhere I go, including future professional goals. I believe the beginning of my professional career began when I attended DI Saturday, as it made me excited to choose industrial engineering. Now, I am currently a peer teacher for ENGR 102 and I love helping students in their first engineering class and answering their questions for the ETAM process. Now, when they attend DI Saturdays and I grade their essays it makes me happy to see how their professional journey is also going to begin. In my future, I hope to continue to take advantage of opportunities where I can be a mentor and share my experience with other people. The mission of SEC is to help people advance professionally while also creating a community. Aside from the career fair, resume workshops, and DI saturdays, I believe the most impactful moments SEC provides are in the small things. The stickers, the donuts, the cute dogs, and the pie-dunking bring a smile to people\u2019s faces and help create a sense of belonging. With a welcoming and loving community, people are more willing to help one another.",
            "Question 10": "A passion of mine is running, however it was not an easy journey for me to return back into it. I previously ran cross country back in highschool. After taking a break for many years, it was discouraging to restart my passion because of the different mindset I had to adopt and the physical shape I was in. In high school, I found joy in running by being part of a large team where we would compete and go on group runs. However, starting college, I faced obstacles such as being away from familiar trails and friends, and my physical shape. In order to stay focused and dedicated I reminded myself the important purpose why I wanted to begin again, which was to improve my mental health. In setting a set schedule and finding other people to also workout with me, I was finally able to push myself through the mental obstacle of increasing my mileage and running consistently. To motivate myself, I focus on the small positives such as gaining energy and exploring new trails. In finding a set time in my week, I now continue to run and am proud of my journey."

Building a strong connection between theory and practice by applying course-content to real-world applications is crucial in terms of development in industrial fields and personal growth.\nDespite taking courses pertaining to both fields of Computer Science and Medicine, I struggled to decide on a major until I joined an interdisciplinary Computational-Biology research-lab. It learned that I enjoyed the data-science aspects far more than the wet-lab segments. As I experienced both fields in a professional setting, I was able to make a cognizant decision.\nA majority of my peers have yet to experience this and remain undecided. As a freshman, it is difficult to find professional opportunities to gain exposure. However, with ETAM, freshman-year is a vital time to discover where your interest lies.

            "Question 9": "I aspire to advance the field of Genetics Research using Data Science by working alongside researchers dedicated to testing the limits of AI and Deep-Learning.\nThe first step to being able to help others is to make sure you're equipped to do so. By challenging myself through second-year CSCE classes as a first-year, being involved in research to gain experience solving real-world health issues, and taking offline concentrated courses like Bioinformatics, I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to become well-versed in subjects of the field.\nIn the near future, I plan to take part in TAMU\u2019s collaborative research program abroad. It will allow me to gain a good understanding of the experience of other engineering study-abroad students, enabling me to further contribute to the discussion of reforming programs as part of SEC's representative voice (first-pillar).\nIn terms of increasing engineering awareness (second-pillar), I\u2019m mentoring students through FIRST Robotics and students preparing for TXSEF/ISEF competitions. This fall, I also plan on becoming a TA for CSCE 120/222. Through such teaching opportunities, I can connect with students and help navigate challenging course-content.\nAs part of SEC's mission for professional advancement (third-pillar), I hope to initiate a program that provides opportunities catered to students with all-levels of experience. Career Fairs are extremely beneficial for upperclassmen in finding professional experiences. For students with undecided-majors or lack of experience, I want to work with Corporate Relations in organizing short-term internships with small-projects, enough for students to gain a good understanding of a certain major in the professional realm.",
            "Question 10": "In UNT\u2019s BME-lab, I worked on a project culturing cells for modeling heart-diseases in effort of studying cardiomyopathies in-depth to potentially develop cures.\nI spent about 6-hours every day for two months culturing and monitoring stem-cells. Just as the cells began evolving into organoids, I was infected by COVID-19. Having to quarantine, I asked a lab-mate to care for the cells. However, an accidental mistake of exposing the cells to agents outside of the fume-hood led to contamination of the entire plate, throwing away two months of work.\nUnable to stand the feeling of uncertainty, I took a step back and approached the situation analytically. I wasn\u2019t left empty-handed. I had over 5000 images of the cells at different stages. I went back to the initial goal of the project: find the most optimal conditions to culture cells for disease-modeling. I built an ML-Model to identify which factors would produce the most successful organoids.\nBy adapting to the situation, I was able to still make an impact in my lab by refining procedures for disease-modeling. Even in failure, there\u2019s potential for something positive to be uncovered. Applying problem-solving to the given circumstances got me much farther than dwelling on the initial plan."

This approach will not only enhance public understanding and appreciation of engineering but also demonstrate our commitment to societal betterment. For example, a class on the physics of yoga or the engineering behind mindfulness apps. This approach not only broadens the appeal of Engineers' Week to a wider range of students but also reinforces the connection between engineering and everyday well-being, illustrating the practical and diverse applications of our field. By organizing events that combine engineering challenges with charitable causes, we can engage more engineers in meaningful activities while giving back to the community, thereby fulfilling a crucial aspect of our mission.",
            "Question 9": "As someone who entered A&M Engineering unsure of which engineering major to pursue, I want to help new engineers find their path and reach their professional goals. The vast array of engineering fields can be overwhelming for first-year students. This pillar's commitment to being a voice for all students is crucial in ensuring newcomers are well-informed about the diverse opportunities and paths within engineering. It's about making sure every student's needs and concerns are addressed, particularly those who are still exploring their options. This approach not only helps guide students through their initial decision-making process but also fosters an inclusive and supportive environment where all voices are heard and valued. First-year students need to have a representative platform where they can learn, inquire, and get a sense of direction in such a diverse and broad field. Incorporating a passion for helping others into long-term professional goals can deeply enrich one's engineering career and significantly contribute to the Student Engineers' Council's mission. Firstly, focusing on projects and research that address societal needs, such as sustainable energy, healthcare technology, or community infrastructure, can integrate this passion into day-to-day work. Secondly, in a leadership or mentorship role within the Council, we can advocate for and develop initiatives that support and guide less experienced students, fostering an environment of mutual aid and knowledge sharing. This approach not only aligns with the Council's objectives of promoting engineering awareness and professional development but also builds a more cohesive and supportive engineering community.",
            "Question 10": "An experience where I showed strong commitment was when I auditioned for a dance team at college. The primary roadblock was the highly competitive auditions, which required advanced skills that I was not confident about. To prepare, I dedicated myself to rigorous daily practice, attended extra dance workshops to improve my technique, and got feedback from experienced dancers to improve my performance. Balancing this intense preparation with academic responsibilities was challenging, but I remained focused by setting clear priorities and maintaining a strict schedule. This dedication to improving my dance skills was driven by a deep passion for dance and the desire to be part of a team that shared this passion. This experience not only improved my dancing abilities but also taught me valuable lessons in perseverance and time management. This experience taught me how to effectively allocate time and prioritize tasks, ensuring that I was giving my best both in dance and in my studies. These lessons went beyond dance, shaping my approach to challenges and commitments in other areas of life."

Ever since graduating high school, I feel as though everything I did was to further my professional career. This is a sentiment that many, if not all engineering students can relate to. Events such as Industry Night, Career Fair, and Company Chats have not only helped me understand the professional world, but truly realize what I wanted to do with my own career. Meeting with professionals in industry truly opened my eyes to the possibilities. When I thought about what these events had in common, I recognized that they were all organized by the SEC. My reason for wanting to join the same organization is my wanting to pay it forward. Just as I realized my professional goals, I would love to help my peers realize theirs through an opportunity as great as this.",
            "Question 9": "As I eluded in my previous essay, I would love to help the SEC through the Engineering Development committee. One way I can contribute to this sub-team is with my ideas for future advancements. One of my sole reasons for coming to TAMU was its incredible alumni network. It is well known that the Aggie network is one of the strongest and largest alumni networks of any institution. That being said, in my college experience thus far, I have not felt it to be so. I have no doubt that Aggies are widespread in the professional space, but alumni are rarely encountered outside of certain presentations. Even at career fairs and such, most recruiters are not TAMU graduates. One way to reinforce the strength of the Aggie ring is to host more alumni specific events for underclassmen. One idea would be to invite alumni in industry back for DI Saturday. This way when a department presents their major to freshmen, they can also display different existing career pathways to those who are interested. An example of this would be a NASA engineer for an AERO presentation, an AECOM engineer for CVEN, or even a TI engineer for CPEN. Another option would be the introduction of a 1-on-1 request option for freshmen who want to learn more about an industry. This would help anybody still confused about their future path. There are infinite possibilities for these implementations, all of which I am incredibly passionate about.",
            "Question 10": "My story as an Aggie is both unique and well known at the same time. When I was admitted to Texas A&M, it was under the Texas A&M Engineering at Blinn program. I was ready to accept the challenge, as I knew that after only one year of hardship, I would be an Aggie for life. What I was not prepared for was the toll the program took on my schedule. Commuting from the TAMU main campus to RELLIS and back every day was a roadblock in itself. My first two semesters at Texas A&M, however, made me realize there is nothing in life you can do by yourself. I made sure to hold myself accountable and organize regular group study sessions. The key is to surround yourself with the people that understand you and the goals you are trying to achieve. Group study sessions worked because we believed in our common goal. The SEC would be like my second family, helping me achieve my goals while I help them in any way that I can. I also would come into the organization as part of an under-represented community, one which knows struggle, but also perseverance."

While technical expertise taught in class is certainly necessary for engineering careers, so too is an understanding of more abstract skills such as self-awareness and communication, which are vital to success in any working environment. In this manner, I view the SEC as a sort of bridge between the more straightforward classroom setting and the much more difficult to navigate world of starting a career and networking with other experienced individuals. To be able to involve myself in the betterment of other engineers\u2019 abilities while at the same time gaining a deeper understanding of my own professional desires just seems like such a rewarding and emotionally satisfying opportunity, and serves as my prime motivation for joining this organization.",
            "Question 9": "One of my core motivations has always been to pursue my passion of helping individuals to become their most comfortable and confident selves. My life\u2019s involvements have been dominated by this simple desire, and I am proud to be able to say my most rewarding accomplishments have stemmed from my time spent as a mentor, tutor, leader, or counselor to less-experienced individuals. There is no better way to obtain a deeper understanding of both yourself and the world around you than by being intentional in your relationships with others and internalizing the experiences and stories they choose to share. So much wisdom and beauty can be found in observing the human experience, and I am happy to have spent time on both sides of the exchange. I have imparted my knowledge for the betterment of others through organizations like Fish Camp, and received lessons on self-awareness and leadership from experienced professionals through the Zachry Leadership Program. It is this sort of supportive and encouraging dialogue I hope to offer as a member of the SEC, as I may be able to help other engineers navigate the early stages of their professional lives by helping to organize the career fair, partake in trips intended to foster children\u2019s passions for STEM, or lead programs intended to build awareness of all the resources available to students. With this mindset, I will be able to leave a positive impact on those around me while also working to develop my own character within the SEC.",
            "Question 10": "Throughout high school, I worked as a math instructor for students anywhere between 1st and 12th grade. I worked with one girl, Sarah, a third grader, who was struggling more than any of my other students and was much further behind her peers in her abilities. So I made it my own personal goal to help her finally reach a breakthrough. The most recurrent issue I faced was that she would become incredibly frustrated whenever she would get multiple problems wrong, which would discourage her from continuing. It was moments like these that hardened my resolve, as I could only imagine the joy and satisfaction she would finally feel once she felt confident in herself. I learned just how impactful my words of affirmation and constant support could be for combatting one\u2019s doubts, which proved instrumental in her eventually developing a strong math foundation. Through working with Sarah, I discovered how rewarding it was to provide others with the tools they needed to succeed, even if it required patience before the positive impact would ever become apparent. I hope to continue this trend within the SEC to build up my fellow engineers into their most confident and capable selves."

However, I want to step outside of myself and help TAMU engineering students reach their professional goals.\nI believe the Industry Nights the Engineering Development team puts on is a great introduction into the professional world for freshmen engineering students. I personally was introduced into the consulting world via the Bain 2022 Industry Night, a field I ended up pursuing. If I can help freshmen students find a company/industry that they like, just as I did, I will feel as though I have given back to the TAMU engineering community that has given me so much.",
            "Question 9": "As an industrial engineering student, I wanted to find a career path where I could help others using my problem-solving abilities. Luckily, this past summer I did an internship in consulting and discovered that it combines those two items seamlessly. On top of working in consulting, I\u2019d also like to be an intern coach early in my career. At my internship this summer, I experienced the impact my coach had on me. He helped me network and set up coffee chats with full time employees to get a taste of industry, helped me with the softwares we used at the company, and overall removed the barrier I felt as an intern. I feel more comfortable navigating the corporate world as a result. If in the future I can be half as good an intern coach as he was, I would be doing well.\nAs I touched on earlier I would like to expose freshmen to various companies at Industry Nights, in the same way my intern coach helped me network. Ideally, I\u2019d like to add in a few more business-oriented companies (e.g. PwC, Citi). This would broaden the scope freshmen engineers think they have and build the bridge to business.\nI believe that we, as TAMU engineering students, have sky high potential without knowing it. A large part of this is knowledge and industry insights. I would love to be part of the team helping freshmen begin their professional journeys and realize their true potential.",

My muscles had weakened a great deal. I was frustrated and hit a mental roadblock. However, with the support of my close friends, family, and especially, my physical therapist, I was able to flex my quad muscle again in the next few days. Two days later I was walking again. Next, I got in the gym and performed leg workouts. Finally, I was running. Fast forward a few months and I was back to playing sports.\nIt\u2019s strange because the same way I related my journey to you, was how it felt. I focused on what hurdle I can take on today, this week, to get me closer to my goal. And all of a sudden, I was there.\nBeing in the SEC can present challenges. However, I know from my ordeal that if I take it step by step and work closely with my committee, I can tackle anything."

I plan to strive to put forth my personal career goals first, then aim to become a project manager where I can utilize my experience in the industry in order to help others achieve their own professional goals. With SEC, my primary goal is to be involved with the Career Fair, where I can help students achieve their professional goals and help employers look for their perfect candidate. By participating in mock interviews as an interviewer, I can give feedback to students and help increase their chances of landing their dream job. My desire to be involved also extends to events such as DI Saturday and Industry Night, where I can help raise awareness for departments and guide freshmen toward a major that best suits them. I remember participating in DI Saturday as a freshman and how it helped me decide on the major I am currently in. As for the far future, I see myself becoming an educator. I believe that one of the most selfless things anyone can do is to pass down their knowledge and wisdom to others.

I always tried my best and practiced at home even after 8-hour long camp days, but was still often yelled at in front of the band and made to run laps due to poor performance. It was dehumanizing. Even though I hated him for what he did to me, I put all of my frustration into proving him wrong and becoming the best at what I do. I created and adhered to a strict practice schedule, always showed up early to set up, and was the last to leave after asking countless questions because I refused to be the weakest link on the team. I would go as far as mastering how to memorize music so that I could play it on my lap in class. The work that I put in to prove him wrong ultimately made me fall in love with the percussive arts."

To be a voice for students, advance their careers, and make engineering more accessible to all, I feel that being passionate about service is only 10% of the goal. The other 90% comes from consistent effort, and a drive to solve problems that eliminate burdens from students of all ages.",
            "Question 10": "An experience outside of the classroom that required persistent commitment was being Senior Patrol Leader for my Boy Scouts troop. It was the summer before my junior year, and I\u2019d never taken on a role with that level of responsibility before. Throughout the course of my term, I struggled with managing a large leadership team of numerous positions, coordinating meetings between myself and adult sponsors, and keeping my troop afloat through a major transitional period in our senior leadership. One of the most troubling things that was unknown to me prior was the amount of work that would be delegated to me. Although many roadblocks were continuously thrown, one of the most important things I concentrated on was keeping my long-term goals in check. With plans of redesigning our storage space and long-term service projects, I found it important to delegate my time between the pressing matters at hand, and the problems that would require lengthy solutions, to ensure nothing would be left on the backburner. I made it an effort to submit weekly reports to my supervisors, and share my goals with my leadership team regularly in order to emphasize the important goals that I wanted to accomplish."

            "Question 8": "I imagine that the pillar of increasing awareness through SEC\u2019s programs and events means the most to me. I recently volunteered at the SWE High School Conference, where high schoolers came to A&M. Despite being from different backgrounds, we all had a passion for engineering, and even though I was coaching, I felt myself learning new skills. It was a new experience where I could share my love of engineering with others. We conversed about our shared interests in robotics and other extracurriculars. Additionally, when we participated in the engineering challenge portion, where we had to build a catapult, I had to navigate conversations between multiple people at once because I wanted everyone to challenge themselves and work well as a team. I want to help enhance similar programs in SEC such as the Envision Conference and help more people know about engineering and the change they can bring.",
            "Question 9": "I have always been passionate about working with young people and guiding them toward their life goals. One of my earliest experiences involved initiating an Art Camp during the COVID lockdown to alleviate boredom for children. The experience challenged me to teach many young learners and share with them my favorite activity since seven. However, teaching proved to be challenging as I navigated the balance between providing feedback and managing the learning process. Guiding students through difficulties, I imparted crucial life skills such as patience and concentration, integral to the gradual development of artistic abilities. Despite the challenges, witnessing students incorporate these skills into their work was immensely rewarding. Later, teaching a Python class at my local library provided me with valuable insights. Although I was the instructor, the experience taught me flexibility in answering questions and simplifying complex concepts. In my professional journey, I aspire to continue giving back to younger generations. This might involve mentoring engineers as a part of an internship or participating in outreach programs such as SEC's career fair. Furthermore, being a part of SEC\u2019s many committees will enable me to meet diverse individuals and understand their paths to engineering. I hope to offer valuable advice that aligns SEC's mission statement. Additionally, I aim to foster a supportive community and help aspiring engineers flourish in their professional careers. Lastly, my goal is not only to help them in their academic pursuits but also to listen to their opinions, ensuring a thriving and cohesive engineering community.",
            "Question 10": "Last summer, I took part in the SEC Directed Internship where my group was assigned to find a solution for children in rural communities who are diagnosed with chronic diseases to help monitor their health. I came into the project not knowing anything about what kind of technology is used for health and my mentor was unavailable due to a busy schedule. There were also financial and marketing aspects to the problem which I didn\u2019t know about. Nevertheless, I researched on my own little by little and read a great deal about chronic diseases and how they might impact motor functions. I dedicated my attention to grasping the concepts, meticulously recording any unclear points for future reference. In our team meetings, I presented my ideas and explained why I added certain features. I took feedback from my members, and implemented them for the next meeting as I was dedicated to forming the most optimal solution. The experience taught me how to not get intimidated by an unfamiliar topic and if in the future, I would help in planning an event similar to this, I would give the participant more direction on what we expect at the end of the program."

            "Question 10": "One goal I had outside of the classroom was to excel as a Fish Camp Counselor. When I have a goal, I work to put focus and intentionality into each step of the process. My first step was to fill out the application. I started early and worked through many different drafts to perfect it. Next was preparation for my interview. Days before, I reflected on my goals and motives behind being a Fish Camp counselor, and I was able to effectively deliver my answers when it came time. I was fortunate enough to make a camp, and when I got in, I worked to attend every event possible which included work weekends and developmental programs. This helped me to form a close bond with the other counselors and my partner which was essential to forming a welcoming environment at camp. Then, at Lakeview, I went out of my way to foster a loving and open environment while teaching about and spreading Aggie traditions like Muster and Silver Taps. An Aggie community was truly formed. Once camp ended, I prioritized continuity and checking in on my freshmen, too. Overall, my experience as a counselor was beyond successful."

The fact that A&M Engineering focuses so heavily on developing students in a professional capacity is one of the main factors that set this University apart from others. My father was a 97' Computer Engineer, who has gone on to have a successful career. He found his first job at Hewlett-Packard through the Engineering Career Fairs, specifically organized by the SEC. He went on to work there for over a decade, and without that opportunity, I wouldn\u2019t be here today. The quality of engineers that enter the workforce from A&M are a direct result of the top-tier professional development provided by the SEC. I knew of SEC before attending the informational, but I had no idea how large of a role the SEC plays in this aspect of student growth, and can\u2019t wait to take part.",
            "Question 9": "My ultimate career goal is to become a fighter pilot in the Air Force. I have a passion for aviation, science, engineering, and leadership. From a young age, I\u2019ve always wanted to serve my country, and I was fortunate to receive a high school scholarship from Air Force ROTC. I\u2019ve flown planes before, and it\u2019s very team oriented, just like the SEC. Specifically in the military, there are maintenance crews, weather teams, air traffic controllers, air battle managers, and many other personnel that all come together to ensure a successful, safe, and effective mission. This is very similar to the SEC, where many different committees come together to contribute to the mission: to be the representative voice of engineers, spread awareness of engineering, and to develop professional advancement in students. With my service oriented mindset and drive to succeed, I can bring excellence, passion, and professionalism to the SEC and the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 10": "By far the most challenging aspect of my freshman year up has been my membership in the Fish Drill Team. As a freshman in the Corps, I had the privilege to try out, and I fought my way to earn a place in the Exhibition Block, the most elite section of the team. We started with over 200, and the advisors cut the Exhibition Block down to 18 members. We have put in the work, practicing three times a week during the first semester, and five to seven times a week during the second semester so far. We also came back a week early from winter break for \u201cHell Week\u201d, where we practiced 9 hours a day for five days before performing a mock competition. This prepares us for the biggest competition at Tulane University, which takes place in under a week. Ordinarily, that wouldn\u2019t be too big of a deal, but the team has a legacy of victory. For the last thirteen years, the Fish Drill Team has taken the National Championship in drill. It has taken a lot of teamwork, dedication, sweat, and blood, but the 27\u2019 Fish Drill Team is prepared to take first place once again."

Moving away from home and having to figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life can be a terrifying experience. It would be incredibly gratifying to be able to assist college students of all ages in that journey of self-discovery, opening doors for them to reach and hopefully surpass their lifelong goals. When talking with friends, especially from outside of A&M, they often feel lost when it comes to life after college. I hope to ensure that no Aggie ever has to experience that lost, hopeless feeling once they leave A&M and that every student feels the full support of the university and their fellow students.",
            "Question 9": "It has always been incredibly important that whatever I end up devoting my life to is something that will be able to better society as a whole. One aspect of this is my devotion to spreading excitement and fostering interest in the field of aerospace engineering. I hope to train engineers to be equally as passionate about space exploration as I am, which is of utmost importance as efficient and affordable space travel becomes more of a reality each day. SEC in particular would give me the opportunity to do this better than any other organization as it would allow me to interact directly with curious people of all ages and backgrounds, letting me plant the seed of curiosity in their minds that has been so formative for me. Engineering awareness is something that goes largely unattended in society as many high schools focus on preparing students to make it to college and many colleges are incapable of assisting individuals in finding their passions. An organization that is designed to assist students in the way SEC does is an incredibly beneficial thing for all students as well as the future of engineering as a whole. In the future, I hope to act as a figure in the space industry whose excitement about what I am working on is palpable and the passion I hold for the subject matter is inspirational to everyone around. I believe the dedication I have would be well appreciated in the SEC.",

This can be an exhausting experience with everyone operating at full potential. This includes work days upwards of 16 hours with very few breaks, making sure the freshmen understand the expectations of our organization, and being available 24/7 to answer questions, solve problems, or act as a mental health resource for the freshmen. When it got difficult to continue, I focused on what my reasoning was for being there and what the entire purpose of the experience was. I was in that position to help the freshmen become a part of an organization that I care deeply about, and the experience was not one for my benefit, but for the benefit of the people I was leading. This allowed me to swallow my pride and continue to work hard as I put the needs and experiences of others before my own tiredness."

As a minority and freshman on campus, adjusting to life has been difficult. Without the support of the engineering clubs, I would not have found a place of comfort and belonging with like-minded engineers. Behind the scenes, I know the Student Engineers\u2019 Council works to support these organizations by representing them at board meetings and meeting with the heads of these clubs. This creates a sense of overall community within engineering, allowing our voices to be heard and our needs to be addressed. Without SEC's goal in representing engineers, the community would not feel the same.",
            "Question 9": "I will know I have accomplished my life goals when I see someone smile because of an invention I made. I decided to go into computer engineering because I want to aid in making life easier with the many advancements technology can bring. In the future, I know the many applications of computer engineering to areas such as health, security, finance, and more will allow life to become better for many, and I want to contribute to this mission. I have always had a passion for helping others through community service and creating projects that help others. Besides the goals of my work, I also will be a team player, working with others to accomplish our shared goal of advancing technology, and supporting others through obstacles and accomplishments. The Students\u2019 Engineers Council has a similar mission of helping those in the engineering community and advancing professional development so engineers can help others in their future. As a part of the council, I would work with and help others on my committee to represent the voices of engineers. By using my persuasive speaking skills, my dedication to carrying out tasks, and my listening skills, I will be able to learn what the engineering community needs and advocate for it to happen.

            "Question 10": "Last summer, I decided I was going to run a 5K on a whim. It was mostly because they gave out free watermelons after the race, but I decided to go through with it. Many people were doubtful. After all, I did not work out and my running skills were questionable. But, that doubt made me even more determined to go through with it. In order to be prepared, I had to get in shape. My legs were weak and I needed to increase endurance. So, I ran every day. It was tempting to skip a day because I was tired or I had a lot of work to do, but I made it into a routine. I would put on my running shoes and go outside at 5:00 PM everyday, on the dot. After the initial runner\u2019s high wore off, it was hard to stay motivated. I questioned if I would ever be able to run a 5K when I couldn\u2019t even run around the block without panting. But, I could not give up. So, I continued training. And when the race finally came, I ran it in 31 minutes 16 seconds. And, that watermelon tasted delicious."

As someone without engineers in the family, much less parents that attended college, I felt lost amongst peers who had a plan. However, SEC initiatives, like industry nights, helped me navigate my college experience. I hope to provide students at TAMU with resources to help them advance in their careers, creating an environment where students are encouraged to seek guidance from one of the most valuable resources: their peers. Although advisors and the TAMU Career Center are in place to help students adjust to college, I feel that students are much more comfortable approaching other students to seek advice. By establishing an ambassador program within each engineering department, students will be able to build connections with more experienced peers and get individualized feedback.",
            "Question 9": "In aligning my passion for helping others with my long-term professional goals, I plan on leading community outreach initiatives. In the past, I have taught middle school students how to code, sparking their interest in computer science. Throughout my college experience, mentors played a vital role in helping further my career, and I strongly believe that mentorship is an invaluable tool that every student should have access to, regardless of their background. In the future, I hope to contribute to resources like workshops and offering one-on-one mentorship for future students in my position, lacking guidance and familial support.\nI believe that my mentorship journey can start now. By continuing to grow and being an active leader for those in the same position I was in, I hope to create an inclusive environment where students of all backgrounds can ask for guidance and support. I believe my passion for helping others achieve their potential can advance the SEC\u2019s goal of fostering engineering awareness for all students. The EnVision Scholars Conference, for example, could incorporate professional development sessions or soft skills training led by TAMU Engineers, offering them an opportunity to build their soft skills. Utilizing Career Center services to train TAMU students on how to lead these workshops would provide a fulfilling and educational experience. As a member of the SEC, I plan to utilize my experience to create more opportunities for younger students and students within TAMU engineering.",
            "Question 10": "Upon entering college, I wished to connect with others who shared a similar passion in offering their time and knowledge to support the learning of their peers. After my freshman year, I was presented with an opportunity to achieve this goal by signing up to be a peer teacher, advocating for students and their individual learning needs. It also had the additional benefit of working with a team of like-minded peers to accomplish a common goal: fostering academic growth. However, I had not anticipated the challenges that I would encounter while aiming to offer each student learning opportunities.\nOne major obstacle was learning how to provide valuable feedback specific to the students\u2019 different learning styles and proficiencies. When my cohort of peer teachers received the first wave of students asking for support, we struggled with creating a plan to best facilitate their learning while avoiding giving the answer out. I recalled my previous experiences in the class, hearing from friends how their unique process led them to their answer. In realizing that the issue was with how students approached the problem rather than a lack of conceptual understanding, I was able to effectively guide them towards the right process."

I came to college without knowing how to present myself professionally. Most of my peers felt the same way, yet through the seemingly limitless resources presented to us before Career Fair and throughout the whole semester. DI Saturday was where I discovered my major of choice via my fascination with the ISEN presenter from NASA. I signed up simply for the pictures I hoped he would share of the updated shuttles, yet left the room caring nothing about rockets and everything about combining my fascination with engineering and interpersonal systems into my studies. The SEC has resources that impacted my professional advancement in unexpected ways and I hope to align others with their professional goals through my personal touch on these events.",
            "Question 9": "Helping others has been at the forefront of my efforts throughout my teenage and adult years. I\u2019ve participated in PALS, sleepaway camp counseling, and Fish Camp during this time, and I\u2019ve felt beyond rewarded in all aspects of my life. The communication, leadership, and positive mental health impacts have given me confidence in professional settings that rival even the most sought-after jobs for students. This experience has shown that passion for others' success leads to results of personal growth and is just the right thing to do.\nOne SEC event I seek to partake in is the Envision Conference, especially the fall semester with the younger group. I\u2019ve been offered a director position this summer back at camp, and workshops like those at the conference heavily influence my decision to do so. Seeing their spark of intrigue is a feeling like no other, and I hope to capture it via their exploration of knowledge in engineering. Being able to unite my passions for development in engineering and service through leadership of those around me will reap long-term benefits including public speaking, team building, and time management skills. I feel confident in my abilities in these areas through years of sports and general social interaction, but being able to funnel these abilities into my work would expedite my professional goals of engineering management.

            "Question 10": "I played baseball for 12 years and didn\u2019t make my high school team. I was told there would not be another chance for me to succeed in the sport. Rather than giving in to this defeat, I funneled my disappointment into a determination to improve. I worked out harder, stayed in the cages longer, and remained committed to my overall passion for the sport. I joined a team unaffiliated with my school and ignored all of the factors deterring me. Through four years with the team, there were many times of doubt with everyone having been counted out for good. I was named captain of the team for my final two years and received MVP honors after winning the state championship. There was an immense amount of doubt through the whole process, but the neglect of my high school coach, laughter at our supposed weakness of other teams, and hours spent questioning if it was all worth it anymore led to greater personal benefit than the initial alternative. Making the team would not have made me as unforgiving as I am towards any challenges I may face over the course of my academic and professional career."

This experience taught me the importance of uplifting the voices of underrepresented individuals since it was not a diverse community. By elevating these voices, I was able to help bring issues to light that would not have been otherwise, which allowed for impactful change in the community as a whole. The first pillar has a similar goal since it emphasizes the importance of listening to all voices among engineering students. While the engineering student population at A&M is diverse, it is still important to value everyone\u2019s experiences and backgrounds since collaboration is stronger when its contributors bring different perspectives and outlooks.",
            "Question 9": "My long-term professional goals include graduating with a degree in computer science and venturing into the field of web development in the future. This past summer, I incorporated those goals with my interest in helping others by spending it in India teaching underprivileged kids in rural areas about the importance of computing using Scratch and Python. I saw firsthand how the relationships I built with the kids fostered trust not just with them, but within the community, which allowed me to leave a lasting impact. This experience brought upon a passion for making computing accessible for everyone, especially in the digital world we live in now. This passion can contribute to the mission of the Student Engineers\u2019 Council because I think it\u2019s similar to the second pillar, which is to increase engineering awareness. Engineering, and more specifically computer science applies to almost every field that exists and everyone can benefit from gaining knowledge about it. If I am accepted into the Student Engineers\u2019 Council, I would aim to join a committee under the External division to use my past experiences to make the most valuable impact possible on the community. More specifically, the opportunity to work on philanthropy events and the EnVision conference would allow me to use my passion effectively as part of the Student Engineers\u2019 Council.",
            "Question 10": "During quarantine, it was clear to me that charities were struggling from being unable to receive as many donations as they normally would. Knowing I could help them, I started a club to help alleviate this need: Charitable Change. I led drives for various organizations like the food bank and rehab centers. As we grew, we started to expand from drives to different activities like running seminars to increase interest in STEM for girls.\nSince it was the height of the pandemic, the biggest roadblock we faced was finding ways for everyone to stay safe in each step of the process, especially for the drives. To alleviate this, we made sure there were collection bins at multiple locations across the city and we created sign-up sheets to control the flow of people so contact was limited. Another roadblock we faced was publicity. Social media was our only form of publicity but by contacting schools and neighborhood-specific organizations across the city, we were able to grow our following and receive a massive response. By supporting organizations that I am passionate about, I made a tangible effect on not only my school but the larger Austin community as well."

            "Question 10": "A time I demonstrated a strong commitment to achieving a goal was whenever I was the captain of my high school water polo team and we got a new coach. When our new coach came, it wasn\u2019t long before my teammates questioned her authority and began to slack-off. When they got in trouble for slacking, many players thought it was unfair and continuously complained. As captain, it was formally my responsibility to be the bridge between players and coaches, so I had to take action. I decided the best way to deal with the situation was to call on my courage and hold a team meeting in the locker room. In this meeting I emphasized that even though Coach's directions could seem different and perhaps wrong, we had to be open to change. And either way, I explained, it is important to respect authority as an application for life. Being unwilling to compromise with someone put in charge of you can only lead to toxic results. I called out a few of my teammates constructively, ensuring they understood what was best for the team. After our meeting, practices ran smoother, games went better, and the team had more fun."

By combining my technical expertise with a commitment to accessibility and inclusivity, I hope to break down barriers and ensure that STEM education becomes a vehicle for empowerment and upward mobility, particularly for those without such opportunities. This aligns seamlessly with the mission of the SEC and reinforces my dedication to fostering a more inclusive and accessible engineering community.",
            "Question 10": "Back in high school, I took a business incubator class. It was structured to teach students valuable business skills, networking opportunities, and general startup advice. At the end of the year in May, the school hosted \u2018Pitch Night,\u2019 a Shark-Tank-Styled competition between the top five teams. What\u2019s on the line? $15,000 to get our new company off the ground.\nOur company was named Kickoff, a new innovative online platform that facilitates NIL sponsorships with local businesses and underrepresented athletes. At the time, the NCAA had only allowed college athletes to profit off their Name, Image, and Likeness for several months; it was a brand new and limitless industry, and we were paving the path.\nSpoilers: my team and I didn\u2019t win. Instead of throwing in the towel and calling it quits that spring, the Kickoff team and I returned to the drawing board. That summer, we met with investors and other CEOs in the same industry. After meetings with corporate leaders, private investors, and start-up grant foundations, we raised more than enough money to continue our company through the next year.\nI have learned one valuable lesson: when one door closes, another will open up soon."

In the engineering field, the importance of connections cannot be understated. Countless students without mentors or networks are left oblivious in the cutthroat field. The SEC\u2019s mentorship work ensures that every student has the resources to unlock their innovative potential and make their mark. The SEC equips students with invaluable guidance through times of uncertainty, from ESO open house to pre-career fair workshops. Events like these have been instrumental in navigating me through the unfamiliarities of Freshman year. The SEC\u2019s mission of fostering professional advancement for all engineering students is critical in facilitating the support, encouragement, and knowledge every student needs to embark on a profound professional journey.",
            "Question 9": "My outlook regarding my impact on the SEC starkly resembles that of a childhood favorite: television crossover episodes. I love it when my interests connect. Crossover episodes where ICarly teamed up with Victorious or Phineas and Ferb trained with the Avengers captivated me more than anything. I\u2019ve subconsciously created \u2018crossovers\u2019 in every part of my life.\nShadowing at a research clinic, and studying the effects of an mRNA vaccine for CMV combined my love for the sciences and obsession with innovative solutions. Being a member of Engineers Without Borders merged my interests in design and my drive to help others. Being the president of Operation Smile synthesized my interest in service and leadership.\nI plan to use biomedical engineering as a crossover between healthcare, innovation, and service. This will allow me to change the world by cultivating a positive impact on healthcare globally.\nI want my experience in the SEC to be as exciting as Jimmy Neutron casting spells with the Fairly Odd parents. I plan to provide this unique perspective when enforcing academic and social opportunities for students at A&M. I\u2019d plan events for non-engineering students with a drive for innovation to become introduced to engineering, advocate for competitions where students work with engineers from various disciplines towards an innovation that combines their unique passions, and find speakers eager to discuss interdisciplinary engineering opportunities to students.\nI can influence the SEC by promoting an environment of crossovers where diverse interests converge, inspiring innovation and opportunity in engineering students.",
            "Question 10": "I had always wanted to become great at poker. Texas Hold \u2019em was always about more than cards and money. It was math, strategy, and psychology all entwined into one.\nInitially, deciphering people\u2019s thoughts and manipulating the odds posed a challenge, inducing me to study streams of the World Series and discern common tells of nervous and confident players. Once I solidified my knowledge of the game, I faced a new challenge.\nI recall countless hands where friends said \u201cI just got lucky\u201d after winning. I realized the recurrent notion that success was a matter of chance, not skill, was a universal experience with many female players. In the male-dominated game, women often face underestimation and microaggressions.\nThis realization served as a powerful catalyst, motivating me to be great. I immersed myself in a myriad of strategy videos and meticulously mastered probabilities until my talent could no longer be denied by preconceived notions of my capabilities.\nMy love for poker parallels that of my passion for engineering. In both, success is not dealt, but created through critical thinking and finding unexpected solutions. Poker has fostered unexpected growth and skills within me."

It's about more than just landing a job; it's about gaining love and respect for the industry. Too often, students enter engineering for different purposes without any knowledge of the field. I feel that there is so much disconnection between what university classes teach and what is actually applied in the real world. I've felt it firsthand during networking, where I lacked understanding of the field that people were enthusiastically talking about. I'm determined to become an engineer who is also proud of their work. By gaining insight into the daily lives of professionals, we can inspire the next generation of innovators driven not just by necessity, but by interest. I want to immerse myself in every aspect of engineering, to make a meaningful impact. It's about finding your passion and making a difference in the world.",
            "Question 9": "Incorporating a passion for helping others into my long-term professional goals is integral to my vision for a fulfilling career. As an aspiring engineer, I aim to leverage my technical skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that address societal challenges and improve the lives of others. Whether it's developing sustainable infrastructure to enhance communities' quality of life or designing accessible technology, I am committed to making a positive impact through my work.\nAs a member with the intent of joining the SEC, I believe that by actively engaging in social responsibility and community outreach I can contribute to the mission. Something that I would love to contribute to the growth of the SEC is having deeper inter-relations of mentors and students that are major specific and more social activities. I am very passionate about bringing engineers of different disciplines together, as many students don\u2019t meet many new people. Something that I look forward to as becoming an upperclassman is being able to help younger engineering students with their troubles. I feel that there are so many resources that we are not aware of that can greatly affect our outlook on engineering studies and their professional careers. We have a great Alumni association that inspires the next engineers, that we all want to become a part of. By helping others can we only grow ourselves. By championing inclusivity and empathy in all aspects of the organization's activities, we can create a supportive environment where every student feels empowered to succeed.",
            "Question 10": "Since fifth grade, dance has become a large part of my identity. However, as I transitioned into high school, finding time for my passion for dance presented a series of hurdles. Despite the support from my parents, societal pressures often cast doubts on my ability to balance academics and dance. The first step I took was emphasizing to my parents that dance was something I wanted to be part of my daily schedule. It wasn\u2019t just an activity for me.\nA large shift in mindset was needed, I reframed dance as an equivalent to any other responsibility. Something important to understand is that pressure and stress comes from one not taking action over the things they have control over. No one can set boundaries other than yourself. So, making the decision and being consistent with all the work, that I made no excuses for made me successful in balancing both. I employed this thought so clearly that I continued dance throughout high school until my dance instructor quit due to health related issues. I think that many people fail to realize that changing your mindset towards a goal is the first and most important action you can ever take."

As a freshman, I knew little about the field of engineering and I\u2019d never had any proper career advice, but thanks to SEC events I attended such as the Career Fair and Industry Nights I was able to explore possibilities and realize what I wanted to do with my future. Our school prides itself on its Aggie Network and how we support one another in our endeavors, and SEC is in the perfect position to embody these values. I want to help contribute to this by organizing these opportunities and giving them chances to grow both as people and engineers, and to help them stand out in an ever-growing field.",
            "Question 9": "I strongly believe that the most important quality of humanity throughout its history has been our ability to work together to achieve our goals and make our lives better. Collaboration opens us up to new ideas that we might not have thought of ourselves, which makes the collective unit more powerful than a group of individuals. I will help foster a community wherever I go that encourages a symbiosis between all parties involved, and one of the main ingredients for this can be perfectly described by A&M\u2019s value of Selfless Service. By helping others without regard for personal benefit, I want to build trust with people and help them make the world a better place themselves. I also believe that strong leadership is a key aspect of developing this, as the energy from people in high-level positions trickles down to all members of a group. I have experienced this myself as a two-time Fish Camp counselor. It was always stressed that we as counselors had a huge influence on the energy of the freshmen, and I saw that in practice so many times. Showing care and enthusiasm for what I did frequently helped my freshmen break out of their shell and participate fully in activities, which made the whole experience much more enjoyable for everyone.\nI continuously aim to develop my leadership skills, and in SEC I can get the opportunity to put them into practice and gain valuable experience.",

I was also abroad and unable to attend meetings, which fell at 4 AM local time for me. I felt I was falling behind because I didn\u2019t know how to use our software and began to lose my motivation, but upon returning for the fall semester I regrouped. I spent a large portion of my time in the aerospace building catching up and teaching myself as much as possible, with occasional help from the officers. I continued to learn and improve, and by the end of the semester, I was an important member of the team, having designed and built large parts of the plane and encouraged other members to join in social activities and increase engagement. Our good team morale and high work ethic that was created over the course of the year helped us win our competition in April."

I love being able to give specific feedback for career fairs, industry nights, and programs through SEC surveys. It has been the only way to share constructive criticism, with so little authority as individual students. When I walk out of Zachry, exhausted, and I see SEC members tabling with therapy dogs, donuts, or hot chocolate, it absolutely makes my day. I am reminded to instantly check on myself, and remember that classes shouldn\u2019t be consuming my thoughts. I hope to become part of that voice for my peers, and be that beaming smile they see when they leave Zachry everyday.",
            "Question 9": "Growing up privileged enough to afford annual doctor checkups and medical scans, I was previously shielded from the reality that healthcare is not as affordable, efficient, and accessible as it may have seemed. With an undergraduate major of biomedical engineering, I hope to aid in creating a future where medical devices can be used to make healthcare more accessible and efficient.\nWanting to go into the medical field, all my aspirations revolve around helping people. Having a degree in biomedical engineering will give me the advantage of being knowledgeable about not only the health of my patients, but about the design and functionality behind each piece of equipment and technology I am working with.\nAlthough passionate about the engineering and science aspects of the medical field, I am even more eager to form interpersonal relationships with coworkers and clients, in every stage of life. The mission of SEC is to prepare young engineers in both hard and soft skills that will help them succeed. I believe I could be an asset to internal relations and E-week planning, as I love encouraging group bonding, and getting people out of their shells when it leads to growth in community. E-week planning also excites me, with the prospect of making people feel seen and supported no matter how rough times get. Through SEC, I could continue to build and share these soft skills, while also expanding upon my devotion to volunteering and forming meaningful connections with others.",

The mission of this organization was to provide free basketball training to underprivileged students whose parents could not afford to pay for them to join club basketball. We started small, recruiting friends from our basketball teams to volunteer as coaches, and advertising for kids throughout school and neighborhoods. Soon, the club picked up and started gaining positive feedback. Suddenly, Covid hit, and in-person activities were shut down.\nAfter many months of this setback, we were itching to get started again. We discussed with school administrators and parents on how to come back safely without health risks. I learned not to be afraid to reach out to a community asking for support and suggestions, what\u2019s the worst that can happen? Slowly but surely, we began adding back in a few hours a week, but this time splitting groups into limited numbers, and incorporating distance and sanitation. The real reason we were able to bounce back from this setback was because of praise and gratitude from parents. No matter how small we came back, any sort of positive impact made it worth it."

The happiness I felt when seeing my peers thrive in a community that I took part in building up was extremely rewarding and is precisely why the first area of the SEC mission resonated with me.",
            "Question 9": "I have a massive passion for the education of younger generations mostly because I was a youth teacher for grades K-8. Within that position, I was able to gain experience and support these students with their education and personal growth. I also was the president of our Rotary Interact club at my high school, which revolves around community service, and I found my fondness for the assistance of others. We hosted various projects, whether it be helping the elderly, small business owners, or just the city at large. I believe my experience on such topics would align with the external division of the SEC and the mission of engineering awareness and upholding philanthropy. I was also pleasantly surprised and extremely interested in the work EnVision does. I appreciate events like EnVision because I experienced the influence of awareness firsthand. I had first only ever heard of the concept of engineering but when I attended events and camps, a few hosted by A&M, I was able to expand my knowledge of engineering and demystify what it truly is. These opportunities allowed me to find a love for engineering and led me to choose it as my major.

            "Question 10": "In the summer of my sophomore year, I was diagnosed with a type of OCD called Trichotillomania, hair-focused. It first presented when my hair which used to require two loops of a hair tie began to demand more, my hair was thinning and I didn't know how to control it. I went to a specialist where I learned how to take back my life by utilizing tools, like fidgets, and mental techniques that were able to slow down my compulsion. One roadblock is that it is fueled by stress, so anytime I am in a stressful situation, school or personal, I have to actively fight against my OCD. Further, this commitment to regulating my condition is a daily battle and I believe that my dedication to not letting this situation define me is truly the best goal I could have ever achieved. My history of both accepting help and providing help to others is something that I hope to continue representing in SEC, especially in the mental wellness focus. Mental health is so important and I love all that SEC does to support the students of the College of Engineering both academically and mentally."

            "Question 10": "For the last 11 years, I have continued to pursue Taekwondo and the disciplines it encompasses. While earning my second degree black belt was physically and mentally strenuous, becoming an instructor was far more challenging. When I first began to teach, I was shy, soft-spoken, and indecisive; none of which are the traits of a successful teacher. The harsh feedback from other instructors and supervisors pushed me to take that first step beyond my comfort zone. From that point on, I aspired to not just become another instructor, but one who was reliable, inspiring, and could have students confide in them when needed.\nI struggled to push through the plateaus of this journey; when I felt I was not making any progress towards my goal. To stay focused and dedicated, I would observe other instructors and watch what was successful for them. This allowed me to step back and reevaluate my original approach, and to develop it with the guidance from experienced mentors.

Our teacher announced that our final project would be a ballistic catapult system that shoots projectiles at different angles.\nAt first, I was lost and worried that the project was out of my league of experience. However, as I started researching ballistic catapult systems, ideas began to come to mind. After rummaging through my garage, I found some old pipes and an air compressor from our pool and began working. For the next several days, there were many iterations of paper drawings, design changes, and consultations with my teacher. There were interim happy moments when a subsystem worked and nights of desperation when the air compressor failed. Then finally, we were asked to demonstrate our ballistic mechanism. My project launched beautifully and excelled beyond simply completing the challenge. At that moment, I began believing in my capability to pursue an engineering career.\nMy ability to take an engineering problem from idea to implementation is what drives me to stay resilient in all of my professional pursuits."

For 75 straight days, it demanded strict discipline and adherence to six daily tasks, pushing you to your limits. My goal wasn't just physical transformation; I sought to build mental fortitude and discipline. Roadblocks were everywhere. Social gatherings tempted me to break my diet rules, and late nights deterred me away from my minimum 45-minute outdoor workout. However, I learned to adapt. Having my best friend be my accountability partner proved invaluable. We pushed each other to exercise and stay on track, celebrating each other's wins along the way. Focusing on small victories was another key. Each milestone, no matter how insignificant, fueled our progress towards the final goal. Completing the challenge brought newfound clarity. It built a deeper dedication in all aspects of life. I was able to create good habits and shift the discipline the challenge taught me into my academic life. I learned the importance of involving myself in all the opportunities that came across my path, which is how I plan on enjoying my time, if given the opportunity, in SEC."

            "Question 8": "Of the three pillars, the SEC\u2019s mission to increase engineering awareness through its programs and events resonates with me the most. As a freshman, events organized by the SEC including the Engineering Student Open House and DI Saturday were instrumental in introducing me to engineering opportunities on campus and in my career. Having exposure to information on professional advancement has always been a priority to me, as I first discovered what engineering truly was through my high school\u2019s Women in Science and Engineering Club. The impact it made on me drove me to become President of the club to perpetuate STEM career awareness to members by bringing guest speakers in the field to share their experiences and advice. The SEC\u2019s programs for not only A&M students, but also K-12 students similarly create this crucial influence, and I would love to be a part of that.",
            "Question 9": "As an aspiring biomedical engineer, I hope to incorporate my passion for helping others by making a genuine impact in healthcare not only by contributing to advancements in medicine, but also by advocating for improvements within the system. Disparities are extremely prevalent in medical care, and I strive to address it within my career by being a representative voice for those who may not have the ability to be heard. I hope to contribute this mindset to the SEC\u2019s mission by similarly identifying issues engineering students are facing and reflecting their needs through action. As a member of A&M\u2019s competitive classical Indian dance team, Sahithya, I have learned the importance of advocating for the interests of others by communicating issues with the leadership that they may not be aware of, such as a lack of information for new members. Within the SEC, I plan to utilize the opportunity to be a leader by uplifting the voices of the student body the council represents.",
            "Question 10": "Every June, I volunteer at Camp MI Way, a program that encourages the movement of children with disabilities. The campers\u2019 endeavor to show compassion without prompting and individual joy for simple activities has inspired me beyond end. As a junior director for the program, I made sure to instill this kindness and enthusiasm the campers demonstrated into counselors training to work with them.\nThe pandemic necessitated a transition to a digital realm of summer camp that we had never traversed. I collaborated for months prior to the camp to pitch ideas to adjust to our new conditions. To replace the regular usage of nonverbal communication hand signals for \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d that could not be implemented through a screen, we created a system of scanning, presenting the song, skit, or craft the camper would be engaging, then gauging their body language to determine if they wanted to participate in it again. I designed props for counselors to visually accompany activities, and made explanatory videos for their training on camp basics, like the significance of interaction versus entertainment. All throughout, the campers pushed me to remain dedicated to improving the camp experience and reminded me of the importance of my work."

            "Question 8": "As a naturally quiet person, I struggled to express my thoughts. Even after practicing in front of a mirror, when it came time to speak, I would forget everything. This became detrimental to my education and I needed to change. It has taken me many years to become confident in speaking in front of my peers and articulating my views. For this reason, the first pillar of SEC resonates the most with me.\nI know I am not the only person who finds communication difficult. It would be my goal to listen to and serve as a voice for those unable to speak for themselves through the Society and Graduate Relations committee. I can listen to others' difficulties and enjoy putting a plan into place to mediate these problems. Furthermore, I enjoy bringing people together. This would increase awareness of other organizations and opportunities while forming stronger bonds between students.",
            "Question 9": "As an aspiring aerospace engineer, I plan to build faster and more efficient aircraft. Cleaner vehicles impact the entire world, decreasing pollutants and making the world a healthier place. Additionally, more efficient planes would decrease the cost of a ticket and make air travel more frequent and more accessible for those who previously could not afford the price.\nHowever, air travel is not the only sector that will need to develop alongside population growth, but so does agriculture, water, and housing to name a few. I believe that it is important for SEC members to become aware of these industries. Expanding the ProTrip to expose engineers to not only popular tech companies but also the less well-known businesses that play a role in our everyday lives such as TSMC or Midea would be beneficial. These efforts would hopefully help others to realize the world of engineering is large and their degree goes a long way. Additionally, members may learn about companies that align with their career goals.\nAs someone considering undergraduate research, it would be nice for the SEC to hold seminars regarding developing engineers\u2019 professional side for the student body. This would be a great way to promote awareness of opportunities to learn more about engineering while developing technical skills. Combining this with DI Saturday and Industry Nights would result in students being more involved within their major and learning new things.",
            "Question 10": "My grandfather and I were close. When I was young, he took care of me while my parents worked. Around 2010, my grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease leading to his memory fading. Being young, my memories of him are after his diagnosis. Regardless, I felt it was my duty to care for and spend time with him, the same way he had done for me years ago. Whether it was reading a book or kicking a soccer ball around, these activities helped me connect with my grandfather.\nPerhaps I expected progress, but caring for him became increasingly difficult. My inability to connect made me believe my past actions had been in vain. This took a toll on my mental health. We were watching the World Cup when he turned to me and said my name. From that moment, I realized that a part of me was still in his mind. I began trying something new in our relationship. Instead of kicking a ball or reading a book, I talked to him. This became a mind-opening experience as I realized I knew little about my grandfather. Our time playing soccer together was over, but one door closing meant another opening."

            "Question 8": "With my major being ocean engineering, I can't help but notice what small percentage of engineering students that my major makes up. This brings me to the SEC target area of increasing engineering awareness. Oftentimes, ocean engineering is outshined by other forms of engineering, which prevents the student body from being able to experience all the wonders that it has to offer. It would be a great service to younger students to be able to know what ocean engineering is all about, including what clubs and organizations the department has to offer. For that I would set up a tabling system for ocean engineering to give them a voice to the other students on campus. This would be a great way for students to engage with upperclassmen to possibly expand their horizon for a potential career path.",
            "Question 9": "The future career that I see myself pursuing involves coastal protection, which means figuring out methods to protect the coast from storm surges and rogue waves. Coming from the south Houston area, I have seen the destruction that the ocean can create, where I have seen half of my neighborhood become submerged underwater during hurricane Harvey. This has led to the formation of a passion for helping to minimize the damage of storms by establishing better coastal protection methods. When going about a career path such as this one, it is important to survey and ask the community about their experience with storms. By doing this, it gives me a chance to receive feedback on how people were affected to use their experiences to improve their living situations. When it comes to SEC, the act of getting involved in the engineering community can be beneficial to the mission. Receiving input from all forms of engineering could work to improve the quality of the school of engineering as a whole. Some forms of engineering aren\u2019t as popular as others that do not have as loud of a voice on campus compared to their counterparts. Allowing these smaller departments to speak on their needs could create interest for other students while also working to provide a better experience for those currently within the major.",
            "Question 10": "Last fall I became a member of the student-led naval design team here on campus, intending to contribute to the creation of a human-powered submarine to be used for competition on an international scale. A project like this can be very intimidating, especially for a new member without any experience. As I went through the semester, I found myself reaching out to the upperclassmen for guidance. It was intimidating at first but I came to realize that they were excited to help out more than anything. This was a pivotal moment for me, where I learned to take initiative and become a better leader within the project. This included developing a descriptive plan for my group and diligently engaging with my team to successfully meet each deadline. The knowledge I learned from throwing myself out there and taking chances led me to understand the ins and outs of leading a project and appropriately dealing with conflict within a group whenever that arose. Joining the naval design team has equipped me with problem-solving, leadership, and collaboration skills that would be vital in serving to achieve the mission of SEC."

With a school this great in magnitude it\u2019s easy to get lost and feel like you\u2019re one of thousands of engineers on campus. I know the feeling of being lost because I was that lost voice in the crowd, thinking that I could not impact the education I was receiving, but the mission of SEC proved me wrong. A representative voice that reaches out to ensure that no student will feel marginalized, and fosters an environment where the student body's concerns are valued and the people in power will listen, making everyone feel valued.",
            "Question 9": "I believe that engineering is not just a discipline, but it\u2019s a powerful tool of innovation that can be used for greater societal impacts. While professionally, I may not know exactly where I want to go, I do know that my primary goal is to be able to see first-hand the impacts I've made on people. I think that the opportunity to be a part of an organization like SEC where we can make a difference and see it firsthand, aligns with my future goals. Mindset is paramount when it comes to taking on any endeavor, especially one that will have an effect on those beyond yourself. In any project, you can\u2019t handle it on your own. Seeking the diversity of perspectives of many can contribute positively to any given project and this outlook of openness can contribute to the goals of the SEC. From being the voice of the students to spreading engineering awareness, and increasing professional advancements the SEC divisions strive to cultivate opportunities that outreach to benefit everyone.\nBy actively seeking and choosing projects that are meaningful to work on, I can contribute my passion and dedication to creating a community that fosters communication, awareness, and advancement. As a part of the SEC, I can clearly envision my passion for supporting as well as initiating and executing projects that target real-world problems translating to supporting the engineering student body of A&M.",
            "Question 10": "I believe that a key component of staying mentally sharp is that you are also staying physically sharp. A balance of the two has positively impacted my educational and personal life. For the past year, I\u2019ve committed myself to at least 3 workout classes per week every week. However, with the presence of school, this seemed to prove a challenge balancing school, extracurriculars, socials, and other tasks to complete. As engineering students, we can all relate that you\u2019d feel unmotivated after hours of math and science to participate in an hour-cycle class. But despite a lack of motivation, looking towards the future and seeing the full potential of the end possibilities, for this instance included the benefits of decompressing and improving my mental health pushed me to want to achieve more for myself. Throughout the year I learned why discipline is so important and how I can make it applicable to all aspects of my life.

As a woman in the small department of Architectural Engineering, I sometimes feel like my experiences aren\u2019t as valued as other majors. I believe that diversity drives a more creative and inclusive future; I strive to foster an environment where students feel comfortable to share concerns and to advocate for the change they want to see.\nI will also use my voice to celebrate accomplishments and empower others to use their unique experiences to improve the engineering department. I intend to achieve this goal by promoting a sense of community during Engineers\u2019 Week, showing the students that SEC recognizes their diligence and that this organization is a resource for them.",
            "Question 9": "I plan to carry the mission statement of SEC into my professional career and not just my years as a student. A resource that I appreciated was having the opportunity to interview and be advised by current professionals in the field of architectural engineering. These mentors have passed down their wise experience to me, and I am eager to do the same for future students in order to foster advancement to as many engineers as I can.\nAbove all else, I want to use my education to give back to my community by creating spaces that ensure the safety, health, and comfort of others. I intend to make a cleaner and more sustainable future for the next generations to come, and I will so by contributing to the success of not only net zero buildings but buildings that produce enough energy to give back to their communities. I also want to serve people in less fortunate areas of the world by innovating solutions to better prepare homes for natural disasters because everyone deserves to have safe living conditions.\nWhen I was deciding which discipline of engineering to pursue, I was unaware of the numerous fields that are available. By speaking at high schools and participating in Envision, I want to promote awareness of the many opportunities the field of engineering has to offer and one day be the reason kids aspire to be engineers.",

I had always heard stories from when she would pick around on the banjo, dancing around the kitchen. I was determined to learn this instrument because it made me feel connected to her and helped me understand a small piece of who she was. While I had a deep appreciation for music, I didn\u2019t know the first thing about chords or reading music.

Months went by and although I had learned what my fingers should be doing, the physical ability didn\u2019t come as quick. With dedication and my grandmother\u2019s musical genes, I was able to make progress. Research and many calloused fingers later, the muscle memory finally paid off, and I was able to pick along to my favorite songs. I created an environment for myself where I could explore creativity without judgment, and it\u2019s become a passion I continue to pursue. This experience has instilled a newfound confidence in myself, teaching me that with focus and motivation, I can achieve whatever seemingly unfeasible goals I set for myself."

I hope, that if allowed to join the SEC, I will be able to more deeply involve all engineering students in the aforementioned affairs and events, as fair representation and communication for all has always been an ideal of mine. It is only proper to hear all aspects of a group out, especially one that is as large as the engineering student body.",
            "Question 9": "Humanity is a complex and often difficult machine to comprehend, much less maintain. But engineers, scientists, and leaders are the repairing components that are vital to the maintenance of the behemoth that is humanity. The giant grinding gears of industry, war, and all other self-destructive tendencies tend to crush smaller constituent parts, but thanks to the tireless efforts of a few components, humanity can continue chugging along. As an engineer, helping humanity to continue to progress is my purpose, whether it be designing life-saving devices, or making discoveries that change the world. Good engineers are altruistic and selfless. Therefore, I plan on being a good engineer by helping others in my professional life, whether it be in the workplace or through outside charity, and getting involved in my community, much like the SEC does currently. Volunteering would likely be another way for me to help others outside of my workplace, which is something that I often do for my student organizations currently. The SEC\u2019s mission of aiding the engineering students of A&M also lines up quite well with my philosophy of supporting my fellows and aiding others.

            "Question 10": "An experience where I demonstrated a strong commitment to achieving a goal outside of the classroom would be during the Purely Rhythmic concert during my high school drumline career. I didn\u2019t make the varsity drumline during that year, which led to a depressive period in my drumline career, where I felt that I just was never going to be good enough. This slump was a massive roadblock for me to overcome, as it ate away at my self-confidence, leading to an apathetic attitude being developed. Over the next few months, I began practicing more, often staying after school for several hours to fully dedicate myself to my goal of performing at the concert. If I couldn\u2019t perform well enough, my directors would cut the piece I was in entirely, ultimately upping the states. I began to slowly chip away at the pieces, taking the music measure by measure, note by note. On the night of the concert, nervousness ran through my body, but I still went on the stage and performed. I had not only proved to everyone that I could be a good percussionist, but I also proved to myself that I would not fold under pressure and self-doubt."

However, soon after my parents gave me that amazing opportunity my mom lost her job. While my business was going well the custom shoe market wasn't great. After my mom lost her job I realized how my parents sacrificed for me. I began marketing more which correlated to more orders. This was the hardest thing I've had to do because of my lack of experience, but in the back of my mind I wanted to give back to my parents after everything they've done for me. This kept me motivated, and eventually, my business gained some traction, and I was able to help my parents a little bit with their finances. Doing things like this to give back to the people who helped me is something I hope to implement for the rest of my life."

I want my professional peers to think of me when they need assistance, and I want to be able to provide this service. With that being said, I don't want this to be constrained within the walls of my company itself; I want to be an advocate for engineering education and provide the younger generation with insight into engineering and encourage them to become engineers themselves someday. Last summer, while interning for Bleyl Engineering, I spent a few days with my colleagues visiting a local kids' summer camp, Ranger ACE, to teach them basic AutoCAD functions and stimulate them to critically think about their own engineering designs. In the future, I strive to take advantage of opportunities like this, where I can encourage those around me to engage their minds and grow within their own respective ambitions. With that being said, my long-term professional goals correspond with each of the three pillars within the SEC's mission statement. I want to be an effective outlet for my engineering peers' voices; a representative they can rely on. I want to promote the comprehension of engineering to both my fellow Aggies and the future generation of engineers, through effective outreach and events. I want to encourage professional growth within the department not only by combining aspects of the aforementioned pillars, but also by promoting the well-being of those around me as well.",
            "Question 10": "Last summer, I was determined to land an internship before matriculating. I knew this wasn't going to be easy, as hiring a high school graduate to an engineering firm was difficult to justify. While juggling AP exams and the responsibilities of a varsity tennis captain, I spent hours compiling an endless list of local engineering companies, researching and envisioning myself there. Indeed and Glassdoor were no use, as an incoming freshman is ineligible for almost every engineering job listed. After sending countless emails, I finally received a response: Bleyl Engineering, a local civil engineering firm, offered me the chance to learn about the industry and immerse myself in engineering. After nailing my interview, I assumed my difficulties ended, but I was mistaken. I knew nothing about civil engineering or AutoCAD, both skills I had to learn. My colleagues were helpful, and I learned how to be a beneficial intern by asking questions and paying attention. I was always learning something new, whether it regarded engineering, having a job, or even myself. To stay on track, I kept in mind my goals, and now having this internship under my belt has proved beneficial, as I\u2019ve seen both academically and professionally."

Because of our committees who craft surveys for students here, as well as their ability to effectively communicate to the dean and board of trustees, we are able to efficiently communicate struggles and holes within our department. This pillar resonates with me the most, not only because I love to make presentations, but because the responsibility of representing all of our student\u2019s lives is the only way that beneficial change is possible. From big issues to small, this pillar allows the struggles of people from all walks of life to be heard in the same manner. I think the opportunity to be the leading connection between staff and students is a great responsibility that I am excited to take part in.",
            "Question 9": "In my future career as an architectural engineer, my number one priority is to be able to lead a team who is able to sustainably and effectively translate values of care and excellence into the projects we create. Most people who commission structures either for themselves or for a larger body have specific guidelines and goals that they deliberately want to instill in the foundation of their designated space. A successful career in this field relies on attentiveness to issues and the ability to coordinate successful solutions. Similarly, this is a main part of what the Engineers\u2019 Council is set to do. By providing outlets for the student body to come forward and share their concerns, trusted leaders from the council are able to provide real change. I think that the ability to help others achieve their dreams of becoming home or business owners through intentional planning and careful consideration of details is remarkable. Through building relationships with the clients, I will be able to provide them with a space that they can call their own. I think this level of self-actualization is seen in the core values of the SEC as well. Much of what the council organizes includes job fairs and informational events that benefit the masses, not ourselves, giving space for career growth and progression to transpire. Being a part of this council is not just another club to join, but an opportunity to help others realize their passion in engineering.",
            "Question 10": "My senior year of high school I was in an AP Art class. While I succeeded greatly overall, it wasn\u2019t pushing me as far creatively as I was willing to go. Therefore, over winter break that year, I gave myself the task of creating a piece that pushed the bounds of my expertise, with the hope to submit my work into a nationally recognized showcase. I became enthralled with the idea of forging my own materials to then create a work that reflected their origin. While intriguing, it was incredibly difficult to execute. I remade my pigment countless times, looking for hints of success, unsure whether this idea was ever going to work. I reminded myself of my original goal, and how this was not intended for a class, but rather growth in myself. After many more trials, I struck gold, and completed my piece how I planned. Months later, I was awarded with a National Gold Key and a spot in the scholastic gallery in New York City. This was never an idea I really deemed possible, but due to my own persistence and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, my goal was able to come to fruition."

            "Question 9": "I hope to share my experience with those who may be clouded with doubt. I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school, and during my sophomore year, I developed severe anxiety, constantly doubting my academic and personal ability. Fortunately, I found a wonderful support network of peers who lifted me up and helped me combat those doubts. Around the time of this turning point, I also had the opportunity to be exposed to several professionals in the engineering community through seminars, professors, and professional societies like Material Advantage. Hearing the stories of professionals overcoming their own uncertainty in diverse fields like research, medicine, and energy encouraged me to reflect on my journey and consider actions I could take to work toward my goals. However, amidst these inspiring narratives, one crucial aspect was often left unaddressed, mental health struggles. I understand not everyone will experience the same things I have, but having more mentors willing to speak about these issues I believe can encourage more diverse thought, empathy, and awareness for our community. I want to be able to be one of those examples, someone who has succeeded with their unique circumstances, not despite them. I believe as a member of this organization I could share my experiences and work to foster a more supportive community and engage with those who may feel unrepresented, especially by invisible challenges. Raising awareness about these issues can help encourage students to be more confident, put themselves out there, and advance toward their goals.",
            "Question 10": "In my senior year of high school, I joined my local First Robotics Competition team. Throughout the year we were tasked to build a robot to compete in challenges at district and state competitions. As a relatively new member, I joined a smaller sub-team tasked with developing the robot's drive systems. What felt like a small simple task, however, turned into a production nightmare. The existing code malfunctioned, and system compatibility issues surfaced, escalating as the competition neared. To overcome these challenges, we extended our work beyond regular meetings, our sub-team read coding documentation, wrote new classes, and corrected measurement errors for more accurate movement.\nAs deadlines loomed, our efforts intensified. Even during competitions between matches we were verifying fixes and helping repair damaged wires. Our perseverance paid off when we won the District Chairman's Award, the most prestigious award from the final competition we competed in that season. In that moment I felt pride not just for the coding team but for everyone who contributed to the robot's success. This experience highlighted the importance of resilience, teamwork, and continuous learning. It left me with a profound sense of achievement and joy for my team."

            "Question 8": "My interpretation of the SEC Mission Statement\u2019s pillar of increasing engineering awareness is its goal of connecting students to the broader engineering community. The school-wide resources that I find the most valuable are those that investigate real-world engineering challenges with an emphasis on collaboration. I often observe that younger learners have limited exposure to team activities in engineering, or that higher-level students without access to research opportunities become isolated from the professional sphere. As a member of the SEC, I would like to increase engineering awareness by encouraging meaningful interactions among all levels of engineers and hopefuls. Through hands-on learning experiences, seminars from industry professionals, and social events with peers, I believe the way by which the Council can best foster engineering awareness is by bringing together the people it serves. I am excited for the opportunity to work alongside others and design engineering initiatives with a people-oriented approach.",
            "Question 9": "I am a citizen of both the United States and the world. I have found home in three different countries, four different U.S. states, and nine different schools. With my exposure to each new location came the struggle of adapting to new environments, and I can recall each of the gestures that made me feel included in an unfamiliar place. Every introduction from a new face, invitation to walk to school, and passing smile has left lasting impressions that motivate me to exemplify inclusion in my daily life and career. As a result, the approach I take to my professional goal of software engineering has been influenced by my desire to help others feel included. Beyond the standard \u201cneed assessment\u201d of the engineering design process, I find I develop the best software solutions after seizing opportunities to establish personal connections and make clients feel truly heard. During a past internship developing medical animations for a group of oncology students, I spoke with a program instructor to ask questions about how the students best absorb information, then used the information to guide my work. Understanding how my audience operates is highly educational for me and ignites my passion to produce a solution tailored to their needs. I would be proud to bring my commitment to inclusion to the SEC by making the voices of engineering students heard, represented, and valued. My willingness to make efforts in including others will help further the Council\u2019s long-standing relationships with students and administrators alike.",
            "Question 10": "My basketball journey began in sixth grade when I, living in the Netherlands and highly avoidant of athletic pursuits, sat down to watch one of my fifth-grade brother\u2019s games. His team was a player short, and before I could protest, a jersey was tossed my way. I finished the game with a stat line of zeros, but was surprised at how much I enjoyed being on the court; I left knowing I wanted more. In my first middle-school season I fell into the role of backup player, but I helped the team by listening attentively, memorizing plays, and leading by example. I faced another learning level upon moving from the Netherlands to Texas, a high-school basketball epicenter. Training with JV in the mornings and Varsity each night, I underwent drastic physical and mental changes as I strove to match my peers and, eventually, adjust to a starting spot. Upon graduating, I had built a resume of program and All-State honors, including my high school\u2019s Athlete of the Year Award. I learned to put my team first and work hard in the role I am given, regardless of what it is\u2013a mentality I will bring to any position in the SEC."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that resonates with me is fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students. While the main point of a university is to teach students technical skills for their later profession, a large aspect of attending a college is also professionally developing yourself into someone ready to be responsible in your future career. It is important that every engineer leaves college with the soft skills necessary to succeed, and this starts with providing engineering students the opportunity to develop these skills\u2014through workshops, company talks, and building meaningful relationships with other engineers. I believe a good way to do this is through setting up a LinkedIn and/or resume building workshop where fellow SEC members will read through and give feedback on your items. Not only will this benefit the ones getting reviewed, but it will also give ideas to the ones reviewing for their own personal pieces.",
            "Question 9": "I plan to incorporate my passion for helping others into my long-term professional goals by setting aside time to mentor younger students and engineers as I get older and continue to advance in my schooling and career. I would like to return the favor of those who have helped me by helping others who need advice in anything from engineering, personal/mental health, or just someone to talk to. I can do this in my future career in many ways, one of which is through working at a company that stresses the integration of interns into the daily life of an engineer. This would allow me to truly help a younger engineer find their footing in a new situation and help them to adapt to the industry. I can also achieve this goal within the SEC by continuing to give advice and mentor younger students as I progress in university. I believe these goals would fit well in a variety of committees under the development umbrella. Through mentorship, I would like to assist in the development of a variety of soft skills\u2014communication, teamwork, and leadership\u2014and technical skills\u2014project management and technical writing. This could be applied in the SEC by setting up a mentorship program, essentially a big-little program, where newer, younger members are paired with older members who have similar interests and ambitions. This would allow for ideas and knowledge to be passed down, a trend which would continue much after any of our times at A&M are complete.",
            "Question 10": "An experience I have in demonstrating strong commitment is when I would tutor the younger players on my football team in highschool for the betterment of the team as a whole. Many of the players in the grade below me were taking either AP Physics 1 or AP Chemistry, both of which were classes I had taken in the past. For this reason, they knew they could come to me if they needed help, and I was open and willing to help them when they needed it. There were many roadblocks that developed while I did this, such as guys not having rides and them struggling with tricky topics. In order to make sure I could help anyone that wanted it, I would drive to pick them up, take them to the local library, and then drive them home afterwards. I also took steps to help with the tough topics by creating analogies related to football or other scenarios they might relate to more. I believe this experience in committing my time and energy into the younger guys on my football team not only helped them in their classes, but helped to further connect us as a team."

I questioned my own capabilities or if I\u2019d ever measure up to my peers. However, being in such a challenging environment led me to strengthen my personal growth and encouraged me to embrace a perspective emphasizing collaboration over comparison. I learnt my unique background compliments that of my peers and creates an environment of teamwork to address real-world problems. As an SEC member, I'm interested in joining marketing where I would strive to build those connections between students and engineering events that will help them reach their personal and professional aspirations and promote a sense of belonging for all engineering students here at the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 9": "In my major, industrial distribution, I specialize in operational efficiency within a supply chain in which I\u2019ve learnt the importance of customer based purchasing that caters to the end-users needs. By ensuring optimal distribution of products, industrial distribution serves the community and makes a meaningful impact on families day to day lives. I am interested in translating my passion for helping others by joining the marketing committee at SEC and helping students discover resources that are essential to achieve their aspirations. I would love to spread more awareness over Engineering Week to highlight all engineers' remarkable motivation and promote a sense of pride for all their accomplishments. I find it crucial to celebrate the diversity between the extensive range of perspectives and experiences everyone comes from to foster a welcoming environment for all students. In addition, I\u2019m eager to advertise SEC\u2019s events by managing social media through vibrant graphics, engaging content, and effective communication for engineering students to always be up to date and excited about upcoming events. I aspire to contribute to promoting SEC\u2019s survey through interactive and engaging emails and flyers to ensure that not only every student\u2019s voice is being heard but students are aware of the significance their opinion holds.

Everything was in order until a day prior to the wedding when I was informed that the cake had toppled. It was devastating and I felt like I failed everyone by creating faulty stability for the base. Nevertheless, I immediately began rationalizing possible solutions to ensure we\u2019d have a cake by the end of the night. With the entire bottom tier cracked open, I directed my sister and her friends to salvage it and craft petit fours while I simultaneously repaired the remaining tiers with frosting and adorned the entire cake with hand-painted designs. By the end of the evening, we managed to have enough beautiful wedding cake for everyone and gained delicious petit fours! I hope to translate my quick thinking and assist engineering students in achieving their goals through SEC."

I grew up in an environment where I was not exposed to engineering until late high-school. I lacked time and resources to explore engineering. It seemed like my peers knew what type of engineering they wanted to do. Because of that, I felt lost and isolated. I talked to upperclassmen and professors to learn about their majors and experiences. This support alleviated my feelings of being overwhelmed. Because of that experience, I want others to have more resources and knowledge of engineering to help kickstart their education to avoid what I went through. Individuals should have the resources to learn about various Engineering fields, and the external division will enable me to do that through events like REACH and Engineer\u2019s Week. Overall, the External division resonates with me because of its ability to help younger engineers.",
            "Question 9": "One focus in my life is the importance of helping others. In high school, I had a large desire to change my community. During the summer months, I taught younger kids how to swim. Those swimming lessons helped me realize how critical patience and effective communication were. This experience also made me realize that helping others is rewarding because of the job itself. In college, I have dedicated time to another organization: Carpool. It is a fantastic experience. I quickly bonded with people I had never met before and learned something new about the people in my community. More importantly, It made me happy knowing I could ensure people got home safely and that I could volunteer as much as I wanted. These unique experiences helped show me how I want to continually improve the communities I am a part of; however, I realized I wanted to help more people significantly. After college, I will pursue higher education as a graduate student and look forward to teaching younger students. As a teacher, I can directly help students find success in the classroom, leading to more competent and confident engineers in the future. After graduate school, I will also look into volunteering options that introduce kids to engineering. I would eventually do this in the SEC through Envision, improving my communication and teaching skills with younger students. My desire to help my local communities would help the SEC positively impact the engineering community at A&M and more.",
            "Question 10": "During high school, I was elected to be the captain of my swim team. As the season progressed, I saw that some of my teammates felt unmotivated. Despite showing up to practices ready to inspire the underclassmen, during practice, I would lose the ability to consciously think about being a leader due to focusing on swimming itself. This feeling, habituation, became something I had to fight. To overcome this, I constantly reminded myself of the responsibility as captain. I wrote \u201chabituation\u201d on my water bottle, reminding me to stay focused on improving the team. I also set an alarm after practice so I could reflect if I was staying focused as a captain. Using those strategies, I gained the insight to constantly remind myself of my mission: being a leader for everyone else. My teammates became more passionate through my dedication. This resulted in people swimming faster as the season continued. My experience as a captain taught me not only how to be a leader, but strategies to avoid habituation, which will help me as a member of the SEC. I will be able to understand the scope of what I am working on and how those tasks affect people."

In my family, helping others is at the forefront of our beliefs and a moto we continually strive to exemplify\nNow, as a student at Texas A&M, I continue to recognize my privilege and just how impactful my degree can be to those around me.\nAs a mechanical engineer, I must value and take part in initiatives to implement culturally aware and also sustainable practices in development. Part of this could be supporting regulation and reform in terms of fossil fuel consumption and creating meaningful machines, blueprints, and designs while working in the industry. I want to take a firm stance in backing initiatives that develop underprivileged areas and hope to push STEM-related interest in youth.\nAs a future engineer, I can raise awareness, and be a diligent representative to others by devoting my time to the betterment of people, infrastructure, design, and research. These long-term goals align with the SEC mission as they showcase the strength of engineers to create real change and how we can diversify our overall knowledge and advancement techniques.

This challenge not only pushed me past my physical limits by everyday workouts but also trained me to push past what my brain was telling me I could not accomplish.\nThe first few weeks during this challenge were a breeze. However, around the one-month marker, things got trickier. Friends who wanted to eat out or get a late-night sweet treat made it exceptionally hard to stick to my diet and rigorous routine. The most difficult part was finding a sense of motivation when I knew that nobody was forcing me to complete the challenge, and I could stop whenever I wanted.\nPushing past these hurdles and moving to month two, I had shifted my mentality. Truthfully, at times I wasn't having fun. But every waking day I felt pride that I held myself liable and realized the immense amount of focus and determination taken to get to the end. The reason I pushed myself to the finish line was to prove to myself I could do anything I set my mind to."

Did you scan them in?\u201d were just a handful of the comments I heard while working at my local doctor\u2019s office. For a teenager, the responsibilities that were handed to me were far beyond my years. The diagnosis alone sounded similar to an entirely different language. The pace and manner of the work place environment became roadblocks that piled on an overwhelming feeling of stress. There were email drafts regarding resignation ready to be sent, but I realized that I set out with a goal to accomplish. I stayed focused and dedicated, implemented techniques to grasp information, and sought out guidance from the clinic\u2019s assistant director. I engaged with actively learning and asking questions to the physicians and understanding the root of the problem. Complex tasks slowly were broken down into manageable tasks and I learned to embrace the challenges. I transformed the overwhelming experience into a learning opportunity that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the first hand experience."

            "Question 10": "My proudest display of commitment was being in the lead marimba role in a leading world class Drum Corps International music ensemble. After initial rejection, I rigorously honed my four-mallet skills during 6 straight months of practicing. By achieving speed, precision and endurance, I finally secured the corps\u2019 coveted marimba position for the upcoming season. However, just days before finals, I was faced with the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome from overexertion. With the amount of literal blood, sweat, and tears put into all of this, I couldn\u2019t even fathom withdrawing so late into the season, so despite the excruciating wrist pain, I persevered by integrating pain-relieving techniques, allowing me to endure intense 12-hour rehearsals in the heat of summer. When we walked onto the field at championships, getting through a successful show felt like such a hard-earned victory, after facing my struggles. The resilience that I showed in fighting for my marimba dreams now translates into any challenge I try to conquer. This experience built true grit in me that I really needed to conquer anything in my path. In the same way, no matter the obstacle, I will strive to achieve excellence as a part of SEC."

I learned a lot about student-leadership opportunities at A&M. But by far the most important thing I took away was the relationships I formed.\nWhen every life meets another, something is born. I would not be who I am today without the influence of the thousands of people who have touched it, whether for years or for a singular moment. My life is a mosaic of all the interactions I\u2019ve had. Just as my family, teachers, and friends have changed me for good, I want to enact change in others by forming strong relationships in my community. Growth happens when new people and ideas are brought into our lives. As a representative of the engineering body, I will prioritize my fellow students because I have so much to learn from them.\nI aspire to get good grades, ace my classes, and graduate in four years from the chemical engineering program.

Through the SEC, I hope to give back to this engineering community that has already given so much to me.",
            "Question 10": "The first three weeks of my class presidency were demoralizing. No matter what I did, there was opposition. I tried to manage everything on my own, afraid that asking for help would look weak and draw criticism.\nEnough was enough. I was overwhelmed, with no other option but to finally reach out. I explained to my classmates my struggles and our need to work together to make this year a success. I braced myself for harsh judgment, but to my surprise, I was met with resounding agreement. Everyone was happy to collaborate and our first event was a unifying success.\nI learned to pick myself up, get back to work, and adjust for next time. I cannot please everyone, and that is just fine.\nThere are still days when I feel overwhelmed. But I remember that there are others out there who were just like me: needing help but unsure how to ask. I am determined to bring the best out of people. I have gained the courage to step out of my comfort zone, confront setbacks, communicate with others to reach solutions, and enjoy opportunities to do my best. I am ready to tackle more obstacles and rise to future challenges."

            "Question 9": "In August 2022, I took the opportunity to teach guitar to a young student. I had never tutored before, and I struggled with the idea. Still, throughout my life, I have never settled with mediocre work. I spent many hours developing a curriculum and tutored my student for nearly a year.\nSince then, I\u2019ve realized my passion for teaching. In my first chemistry class, I struggled at first and began attending office hours and learning textbook concepts, eventually testing my understanding in an intimidating way. I led study groups where I delved into chemistry concepts with other students, creating and solving example problems, articulating concepts clearly, and answering questions. Similarly, I\u2019ve reliably helped my roommate with his learning when he has experienced roadblocks.\nTeaching others inspired me to comprehend chemistry well enough to become a resource for other students. Peers would light up when they recognized the strategy to solve a problem, frantically completing it, impressed with their realization. I love to be part of that process, helping slightly so they still see the strategy on their own. I strive to continue teaching throughout my life.\nI hope to contribute to the SEC mission by advancing students\u2019 knowledge by being a mentor to them, and hopefully implementing a formal mentorship program that would further the professional advancement of SEC members. I\u2019m excited at the prospect of being part of the SEC and I appreciate that students\u2019 development is at its core, as it is integral to who I am.",

Although the assignment was for class, its completion was achieved completely outside of class. Most students met the professor\u2019s standards, making a rudimentary game, and often starting and finishing their project on the same day. Instead of aiming for the bare minimum, I decided to create my game from scratch, spending many hours researching and building the code while preparing for final exams.\nTo achieve this feat, I ran into many setbacks but I stayed committed to the project. The most difficult and frustrating roadblock I encountered involved implementing images of playing cards in the game and tying buttons to actions. To get these functionalities to work properly, I conducted lots of background research, using many websites and forum posts to streamline the process. Some sections of the code required many iterations, sometimes requiring an overhaul of another section for it to work properly.\nThe process of constructing my game was long, required lots of creativity, and tested my patience constantly, but it was worthwhile to me."

            "Question 9": "I have always loved helping people and being there to support others when they need it. Having past experiences in a volunteering organization called Lions Heart, working as a tutor for young students, and as a Peer Mentor at A&M, I have grown to appreciate what it means to help others in their needs and goals. Through this passion, I would be interested in joining the EnVision Conference committee. I hope to be a guide for young scholars and incoming college students and support them in their educational careers. I participated in a mentor/mentee program with the Engineering Mentorship Council and got advice on engineering courses, ETAM, and the various engineering fields. The program helped me grow within the engineering school and presented me with a solid foundation before deciding on a major. These types of programs can be beneficial within companies for college interns. Instilling mentor/mentee programs for college interns is something I hope to do and be a part of when I enter the workforce. EnVision Scholars is a great place to start in achieving that goal. Having had a shadowing experience at an Engineering firm this past summer showed me how beneficial it is to have a guide, especially when you are new to something or starting a new stage of your life. Not only can the SEC give me the opportunity to inspire young minds, but it will also provide me the building blocks to help me achieve my own professional goals.",

I had a big interest in Public Relations and social media and had ideas for clothing designs and instagram themes that I wanted to share with the executive board. In order to achieve this goal, I joined the Public Relations committee. This allowed exposure to the position and gave me a way to interact with the current officers. I helped the officers with merchandise, instagram posts and stories, and creating google forms. At the end of the semester, the club re-elected officers, and I ran for the Public Relations position. I became the PR officer for the organization last semester. A roadblock I faced was having only been in the club for one semester and not knowing many members. I felt that that would put me at a disadvantage. However, talking with the past PR officer, getting input/feedback from other classmates, and working hard on my presentation allowed me to reach my goal."

I would stress and lose sleep over presentations for weeks leading up to them. During my first semester, I decided I wanted to get over my fear and joined the debate team. In the beginning, I was awful. It was intimidating competing against people that loved presenting and arguing, and I was especially behind due to my lack of natural skill. During the first few weeks I often debated quitting; I was exhausted from going to competitions from 5am to 6pm every Saturday for something I wasn\u2019t good at, and mentally exhausted from trying to do something I hated. However, I loved working with my teammates; they believed in me even when I didn\u2019t. I kept practicing, attending mock interviews, observing my teammates, and asking for feedback. I remained open to criticism and the possibility of failure. I began to see improvements. By my sophomore year, I was not only unafraid of public speaking, but I was also winning competitions.

            "Question 9": "Members of SEC are the leaders of the engineering community, with the overarching goal to help all their peers achieve success in and/or after college. Over my summer internship, I learned that in order for a person to succeed in their work they have to be able to help and care for everyone around them. I found myself creating close relationships with people outside of my work team - the custodial staff, catering companies, and members in other departments. Although I did not work with them directly on any projects, their knowledge, experiences, and advice all helped me get around the company/city and succeed. Being able to make connections with everyone, take initiative, and anticipate problems before they arise are some key takeaways that I plan to incorporate into my life. For SEC, I want to be a representative voice for all engineering students (student and graduate relations) because their success is aided by the change that SEC can make.

I initiated a service project to help alleviate the stress for affected families and my fellow peers. I created relief packages with basic necessities for these students to take home to their families. It required organizing a team to collect items, set up drop-off points, and distribute packages. While looking for volunteers and going door to door to ask for donations, a major roadblock I faced is getting \u201cNo Thank you\u201d for an answer. Rather than letting these setbacks affect my emotions, I viewed each rejection as a step closer to finding the support I needed. This project taught me a lesson about resilience and adaptability. I know to keep my goals clear, maintain a positive mindset, and explore different avenues as the most obvious path will not always lead to success. Despite the rejections I faced, I focused on the final reward to give back to my community and reduce stress on these families."

I believe selfless service and giving back to the community is social responsibility, and having the ability to better a situation is very valuable to me. I had the honor to serve as senior class president to give back to my peers and community. After facing the hardships of COVID-19 that depleted school spirit; I played a key role in introducing new traditions and events, fostering a stronger sense of community between my classmates and the institution. Serving under the external division and being able to give back to families or younger students, whether that\u2019s through the Envision Conference, Philanthropy\u2019s E-day, or REACH program, would present me with varied challenges enhancing my passion and dedication in service, community, and leadership.",
            "Question 9": "My lifelong professional goal is to pursue a career in health care. My philosophy is dedicated to both leadership and selfless service which can be translated into working in the medical field. I believe helping and caring for others is strongly correlated to leadership because good leaders should be committed to supporting and serving others around them. I think holding a position in the SEC would allow me to grow in these two virtues and build me up for success in my future career goals. I have previously held a leadership position as a Varsity cheer captain. I learned that listening to other\u2019s needs, earning respect, and effective communication are key to being a good leader. This position not only contributed to my growth in leadership but strengthened my interpersonal skills toward helping others. I plan to incorporate this passion I have for helping others in my professional and college career by having empathy, showing appreciation, and communicating effectively. I appreciate that SEC\u2019s mission is committed to supporting others in reaching their full potential through service. I am eager to participate in this mission, whether that\u2019s by incorporating new events into the REACH program, fun activities for Engineering Day, or new and exciting competitions for the Envision Conference to give back to the community.",
            "Question 10": "Transitioning to college made me realize the value of time, so I decided to spend it by contributing my passion for service into my college experience. I made a goal to dedicate at least 5-10 hours of volunteer service each semester. I find that helping others and giving back to the community are the most fulfilling tasks. To carry out my goal, I joined a sorority to expose me to new opportunities. During my freshman year, time management was one of the major hurdles I faced. I learned to plan out each month by dedicating specific weekends to volunteering and held myself accountable by inviting friends to join me. I have completed my goal each semester and plan to continue to pursue this ambition after college. As I see it, the SEC would contribute to a deeper dive into my passion for selfless service. I aspire to not only be a volunteer but also to take the lead in spreading awareness towards the meanings of the external division. I firmly believe in encouraging other individuals to learn about their surrounding communities and to dedicate their time to something bigger than themselves."

I have been able to learn from them, hang out with them, and make my favorite college memories with them. However, I\u2019ve also seen the \u201cdark sides\u201d of the community as well; students who can\u2019t fit in or find their niche, and quietly spend their days in their rooms, unable to join the groups. The awareness pillar strongly resonates with me because as part of the SEC, I seek to encourage the integration and participation of engineers, with programs and events to help everybody discover those same tightly-knit communities and supportive atmospheres that I was able to join. I hope to take advantage of SEC\u2019s outreach opportunities to continue integrating our ever-growing engineering school and help everyone find a little bit of home.",
            "Question 9": "Whether it was for midnight Calculus help or staying after on a weekend to learn drill back in high school or emergency ENGR 102 assistance minutes before the deadline, teaching and helping others has been my passion for years. Just by being a calming and patient presence, the worst pre-exam nights become tranquil and productive.\nIn the professional world, I foresee this goal transitioning to the aspect of communication. From displaying a calming tone at the Career Fair to managing subgroups or other members as a coordinator, I seek to apply my past communication and teaching skills to lead others effectively and efficiently. In addition to coordination efforts, I believe this skill can even be applied in general council settings, contributing to discussions with both the SEC leadership and other general members.\nHowever, I don\u2019t claim to be a perfect public speaker, and one of my favorite aspects about the SEC is that there are genuinely too many good programs and amazing learning opportunities for me to imagine settling on just one. Internal and external relations alike, I look forward to the opportunity to develop interpersonal skills with everybody from peers to corporate sponsors. I truly believe that the SEC is the organization for me, both in mission and opportunities. I seek to not just bring my own skills to the table in order to continue fostering the mentorship and leadership that the SEC offers, but to learn from the capable leaders of the council and ultimately become one myself.",
            "Question 10": "Being the brass captain of my high school marching band was a definitive experience for me. I led both the 70-member brass section and the dozen section leaders that directed it as well, collaborating with the woodwind captain, band directors, and staff to ensure smooth rehearsals and a successful season.\nDue to a deep-seated tradition of passive, often hypocritical leaders passing down this mindset through tradition, I made it my mission as brass captain to improve this unfavorable part of band culture. I established a hereditary \"Brass Captain Manual\", where each captain can add their best advice and pass it down to the successors and playing on the advantages of tradition instead of being at its mercy. I made it my job to talk to any member, no matter how young or shy, independently and as an equal, building them up to become confident and capable marchers. I may not have been a perfect leader, as no one is, but I have since made it my mission to define and view leadership not as something you \"turn on or off\" when needed to wrangle team members, but a way of living one's life and building a positive, truly helpful environment."

Although I didn\u2019t realize the impact at the time, DI Saturday allowed me to see the extent of options I would be given through the TAMU College of Engineering. Like many other students, I went into my freshman year of engineering, clueless as to what I wanted to major in. I was presented with over 20 different degrees to choose from and most of them were ones I had never considered exploring. On a limb, I signed up for the architectural engineering slot as it sounded the most intriguing to me, and ended up loving everything about the major. Although I came into this event with little knowledge of most majors being discussed, I left with a clear understanding of what major I would like to go into.",
            "Question 9": "Growing up in India for seven years and witnessing the challenges of low-income housing has been a major factor in influencing my perspective on taking on architectural engineering as a major. When thinking about my long-term professional goals, one that stands out is being able to leverage my skills and knowledge of architectural engineering in a way that allows me to contribute to the improvement of low-income housing conditions around the world. One way in which I plan on completing these goals is by specializing in sustainable and affordable housing solutions. With a rapidly growing population, it's becoming increasingly difficult to meet the demand for housing and staying environmentally friendly. I intend to collaborate with other engineers, communities, and even government officials to develop ideas that promote both functionality and efficiency for creating net carbon buildings. Given a chance to be a member of the SEC, I plan on initiating projects and workshops focusing on the challenges related to the housing crisis around the country and how we as a whole can provide a sustainable solution to a real-world problem.",
            "Question 10": "During my freshman year of high school, I went out of my comfort zone and joined the wrestling team. It seemed right at the time since I had experience in martial arts and I was excited to try something new and unique. However, I instantly felt at a disadvantage after the first practice when I discovered that I was one of the four girls on the team and most of the people on the team had prior wrestling experience. Despite these obstacles, I was determined to work through them and make it to regionals. While I had practice every day, I was also staying after school as well as going to taekwondo four times a week. This schedule soon became challenging to manage with school and attending tournaments on the weekends, so at times I was very discouraged. Nevertheless, through the constant support of my family and friends attending my tournaments, I was able to stay consistent with wrestling and maintain motivation. I also found great encouragement through watching my progress and seeing how much I had improved in such little time. In the end, I reached my goal and not only made it to regionals but also state."

This absence turned into a yearning to become that beacon for others who may share those same sentiments. I started by simply teaching my niece and nephews foundational engineering concepts through experiments. When I saw how impactful this was for them, I decided to take a step forward and form an organization in my local area that spread awareness of engineering to underrepresented youth. My mission is to open doors for underserved demographics. The thing that I truly admire about SEC is that it seeks to increase awareness as well. Through programs, such as REACH and Envision, I get the opportunity to have an impact in the Bryan/College Station area while also gaining insight from the community on the issues of tomorrow.",
            "Question 9": "My goal has always been to create systems that are accessible for everyone regardless of their socioeconomic status. I hope that through my profession, I can do so by providing sustainable and economically viable solutions. By creating these systems, I get the opportunity to connect underrepresented portions of society to essential resources, while also spreading engineering awareness. These ideals align perfectly with those of the SEC in the sense that the organization seeks to spread awareness both on and off campus. By partaking in events such as ProTrip and Career Fair I get the honor to build a network with corporations that have those same views and bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

            "Question 10": "Learning how to juggle my familial obligations along with community service has proven to be one of the most challenging yet rewarding journeys of my life. The first obstacle I had to overcome was finding a balance between these two important aspects of my life. I needed not to give too much attention to one and neglect the other. I had to learn how to compromise and coordinate. I did so by educating my younger siblings about the importance of community service and even taking them out on some of my service projects. Seeing how much they enjoyed helping out made it much easier for me to fulfill both passion and responsibility. Another roadblock I had to deal with was the emotional toll these two commitments took on me. Overcoming this meant I had to self-analyze and adapt to my circumstances. I had to listen to myself and take breaks when it was necessary. This path I\u2019ve taken has taught me many valuable lessons that I believe will be of great use in the SEC, such as compromising, organization, self-reflection, and time management.

Engineering fields need engineers from every background, and the External branch helps promote growth with that.",
            "Question 9": "When I graduate and enter the workforce, it is important to me that as a company,we actively work to provide a net positive impact in the community. One of the ways I hope to help others is through mentorship. Every professional in the industry always recommends finding a mentor as soon as you join the workforce who is able to show you the ropes and be your first point of contact when any questions arise. Many companies and organizations have ways to connect its members with a mentor, but the difficult part sometimes can be maintaining this relationship so that both people can get the most out of the partnership. Through SEC, I want to learn how to make these meaningful connections and maintain them well beyond graduation as well. What I love about the SEC is the collaborative and friendly atmosphere this organization has. It makes it super easy to ask questions, make mistakes, and grow in order to be a better leader. This type of environment makes it easy for people to learn from each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses which is a valuable skill that can\u2019t be taught in other ways.

We were able to put on monthly in-person performances until March 2020 when COVID put a halt on my project. During summer, it became pretty apparent to me that quarantine was not ending anytime soon. This was a difficult time for everyone being so disconnected from each other, but it was especially hard on the residents due to limited visitation hours. I wanted to try online performances to help lift spirits and build the community we lost due to quarantine. It was difficult finding how to work out all the logistics at first, but I was determined to make this process work for the residents. My biggest motivation to continue my project at this point was to keep a sense of community between my volunteers and the residents. Even though it seemed like there was no end in sight, we were all living through this pandemic together, and the least we could do was support each other."

Supporting this community through EWB involved small engineering projects, such as building a floating dock and a solar powered pond aerator, demonstrating the importance of creative engineering solutions tailored to fit communities. Engineering awareness is absolutely crucial for younger students. An introduction to the STEM field through interactive events such as E-Day not only inspires a future in STEM, but also improves creativity and critical thinking skills. As a member of the SEC, I want to expand this initiative to better support underprivileged schools in Bryan because I strongly believe that engineering is for everyone.",
            "Question 9": "As an electrical engineer, I hope to improve renewable power consumption in the future and increase use of renewable energy sources to hopefully combat the effects of climate change. I recently learned that the health risks of climate change disproportionately affect minorities, a gap which could potentially be filled with engineering. In minority communities, a lack of engineering awareness means inefficient processes using fossil fuels, lack of new opportunities, and vulnerability to economic and social disruptions, perpetuating a vicious cycle. As an electrical engineer, I will work toward developing more accessible ways to use renewable energy. While I believe reversing the effects of climate change will take more than an engineering feat, I am optimistic that my work can impact lives. As a woman in STEM, I am keenly aware of inequalities in my field, and am always seeking to uplift others' voices.",

Despite my hand-eye coordination, or lack thereof, I was determined to keep playing. The next time I played, I just barely improved, but I had lassoed my friends into playing with me. What started as a leisurely pastime became a lunchtime regimen, where a dozen kids gathered around a single net, waiting to play. It became clear that my practice time was getting cut short, so I created the Spikeball club, where members paid dues to purchase more nets. As our club expanded, we took notice of other local clubs, namely one at a neighboring high school. A one-time tournament quickly turned into weekly Saturday pick-up games, where we would practice until sunset. Slowly but surely, my aim improved, rallies lasted longer, and I learned a trick play or two. Ultimately, enjoying the sport meant it was easy to focus on improving, though placing last in a tournament was also motivation. Patience and perseverance were integral in the learning process, but they are skills that continue to aid me in the classroom."

            "Question 8": "A representative voice to all engineering students is crucial to the success of a thriving team and workforce. Many groups of people struggle to have their opinions and ideas valued in such a large and diverse community. As someone who has had their ideas discarded, I understand how it feels to be excluded, and I strive to ensure that everyone is given a chance to express their opinions and concerns. The Legislation Committee, part of the SEC\u2019s Internal division, represents this. Its goal is to represent all engineering students through surveys which are presented to the faculty. Additionally, implementing policies, such as students speaking directly to faculty at presentations about their experiences, could increase the voice of the student body, something that aligns with my goals. Representing all engineers ensures that everyone's voices are heard, increases collaboration and cooperation, prevents exclusion, and contributes to the growth of the engineering community.",
            "Question 9": "In my professional career, I want people working in a company to enjoy what they do. Whether that means implementing company-wide policies or talking to people individually, I want to focus on empathizing with them on a personal basis and make their ideas feel valued and their concerns heard by creating a community of people who listen to each other. Everyone should be able to work in an environment that supports and uplifts them. This ensures the professional development of the company as a whole. Ultimately, a company cannot function unless the people working for it are taken care of. The SEC\u2019s society and graduate relations committee aims to maintain relationships with other engineering societies through group based socials and events. They successfully bring together all engineers no matter their background or organization and create a community that supports them. This helps the College of Engineering at Texas A&M successfully run career fairs and directed internships. The professional needs of the students are met, and the SEC and College of Engineering meet their goals of helping students. To ensure a successful community, every person must feel they are a part of something bigger than themselves and are making an impact that will last for years to come. I want people to enjoy what they do and strive to work towards something that will help others.",
            "Question 10": "In my hometown, I was a part of a recycling team that cleaned our local neighborhood. We signed legislation advocating for environmentally friendly change and picked up trash from lakes. For one event, we planned to make ten birdhouses in two hours using reusable and recyclable material. However, because of unexpected rain, not as many people showed up, and the event was almost canceled. Instead of giving up, I convinced everyone who was there to continue building the birdhouses. Even though it required a change of location and we carried the materials in the pouring rain, we built all ten birdhouses in just over two hours. While this event may seem miniscule, the impact it had on me was far from it. I was extremely driven to complete the project and help the environment, something I am extremely passionate about. My dedication and focus stems from reminding myself that I am helping and serving those around me. Additionally, I learned to foster a reliable team that focuses on positively impacting others and developed strong work ethic and collaboration skills. Regardless of the challenges and hardships faced along the way, I stay dedicated and passionate about my work."

            "Question 8": "As a freshman, it initially felt daunting to navigate engineering; however, by keeping myself informed through events like industry nights and speaker series, my worries were relieved. Receiving help from the mentors around me and the concerns that current engineering students face can be relieved through the help of SEC. Active feedback from students to understand what they need from college to succeed can be assisted through the help of a group of peers who act as the bridge between students and the administration as seen by joining SEC. Specifically, in the engineering development committee, I can facilitate programs that allow other students to feel prepared to venture into their careers. As a part of SEC, being a representative voice of all engineering students is something that resonates strongly with me as I can positively impact students across campus as they transition into reaching their academic and professional goals.",
            "Question 9": "As a child, I spent many mornings feeling terrified of approaching a 13-foot deep end. As a former swim teacher, I recognized a glimpse of myself in the children I taught and sympathized with their worries. I felt rewarded for being able to pass on my knowledge to others and inspire youth to achieve their goals similar to how my teachers did for me. Guidance from my mentors influenced me to have strong values in volunteering at nearby schools in efforts to increase engineering awareness and future involvement in STEM fields. Thus, I strive to provide engineering mentorship through being involved in STEM-related programs off campus to local high school students with events such as the Envision Scholars.\nGiven my background in teaching, I hope to develop my professional goal of creating technologies that can improve the quality of education for students. Each student has their motivation for pursuing engineering, thus we have a shared mindset of using our skills as a tool to facilitate the achievement of our goals. Therefore, students should have the opportunity to learn what majors are fit for them and learn what desired industries they can pursue post-graduation. Through the SEC, I can promote professional advancement opportunities in the ED committee that allow them to learn about potential future career opportunities. By serving as a member of the SEC, I can connect students and administration to create events that motivate students across A&M and local communities to learn their purpose in pursuing engineering.",
            "Question 10": "An anecdote from a fellow food bank volunteer about his experience with food insecurity changed my perception of truly impacting my community, inspiring my goal to alleviate this issue within the North Texas area. Initially, I gathered peers from my school to fundraise locally, eventually leading me to join a local nonprofit where I could amplify my efforts. During my senior year, I had the opportunity as president to share my advice with a diverse group of over a hundred students of a youth chapter. Oftentimes, we had varying perspectives on how to approach the fundraisers, yet to stay focused, I reminded each other of our shared goals of raising money and bringing awareness.\nWith each new event, I learned the importance of building off my past experiences to be the most successful in my goals, eventually contributing over 170,000 meals to families throughout the years. Initially, reaching out to the metroplex was difficult, but as a social media manager, I built connections leading to strong ties with local stores and schools. It has been rewarding to collaborate with my peers to turn my dreams into tangible realities by reaching my personal goals of growing myself and my surroundings."

            "Question 8": "To me, being a representative of the engineering body resonates with me the most. In my past semester as an engineering student, I grew to understand the complexities that come with this role. Engineering majors have a very niche stereotype that cannot be understood by a non engineer given the increasing workload that persists and the desire to be taken seriously. However, without active individuals in the engineering sector seeking representation, it can grow increasingly difficult to make any changes. Staying integrated, connected, and informed is what I aspire to be, and is what the college of engineering needs. A&M is a ginormous school, but the college of engineering sometimes feels a little too large. By being a representative, it can bridge the gap between students and more influential figures. It can make their education feel important in their college journey.",
            "Question 9": "In my opinion, being a trustworthy person is essential to professional and personal success. In the future, I see myself as a software engineer focused on being a strategic and inventive leader. The way I want to get there is by building a foundation of leadership through service. I believe in fostering community and impactful relationships, and I can do this through innovative professional development and new social experiences. I have always seeked guidance from students, teachers, and SI\u2019s to ensure I am doing my best, so I believe that giving back to the university can change the trajectory for everyone. I hope to be in a committee in which I can showcase my creativity and ideas to make a meaningful impact on myself and others. When I was younger, it was important to me to have kindness no matter what the scenario, even if it wasn\u2019t returned always. I hope to be surrounded by like-minded people that unite over a common goal. The SEC\u2019s goals align with my personal values and I hope to integrate myself better into the college of engineering to make myself a better engineer. By providing career opportunities, it lessens the gap between students and the professional world. The SEC connects a lot of gaps that go unnoticed. Even if my service is in the shadows, I would feel fulfilled and that I made a difference. I hope the SEC can provide for me and I can provide for the SEC in the same way.",
            "Question 10": "One story in particular was when I was in Model United Nations. My senior year of high school, I was president of the organization alongside balancing school and my extracurriculars. One conference fell during a time when exams were intense, I was committing to college, and my senioritis was beginning to worsen. I was already going to university for engineering so my parents were hesitant about my involvement from the beginning. I was getting home at awkward times to ensure the club was going smoothly and to prepare for the conference. It was a cold Thursday and Friday and I was feeling the pressure of placing well at this conference. I became a diplomatic delegate that came up with complex solutions to real world issues. It was fun to be in a big group making a difference even though they were hypothetical solutions. Somehow I placed 2nd and got a research award, came back to school and did alright on the exam I had to make up. To me, if you are passionate about something, you have to find time for that, and the responsibilities you possess."

            "Question 10": "One experience of showcasing my commitment to something was through my dedication to playing chess. Previously as a passionate chess player, my goal was to increase my ranking and overall increase my performance in tournaments. However, I encountered many opponents with new tactics and strategies that I haven't played with. Discovering new strategies during tournaments in the middle of the game led to me losing many games. Rather than being discouraged, I took these losses as a learning opportunity and studied with determination and persistence. After each tournament, I spent long hours meticulously analyzing my games and creating counter strategies to effectively counter these strategies. Although these solutions were achievable, the time commitment and dedication it took was a entirely different issue. I spent hours on end attempting to solve problems that I didn't know where to start and would often get frustrated. However, my motivation and eagerness to learn kept me studying each game for hours on end and eventually helped me achieve a higher rating while playing in tournaments."

I think that this is important because students are the whole foundation for the College of Engineering and ensuring their success is mandatory. During my internship last semester, I started the idea to create a better customer retention program alongside my software duties. In this, I spoke directly to the CEO of the company and designed a program to increase employee retention and progression throughout the company. This project meant a lot to me because during my internship, my boss left the company due to a lack of progression and I took it upon myself to make the company a better place. I think that SEC is another place where I can continue this mission and directly help those in the College of Engineering as well.",
            "Question 9": "Supporting others is a must, especially in today's society. As a future software engineer, I hope to continue helping others by creating safe spaces for those around me to work and succeed. There are many facilities in which a company can help someone, whether that is professionally or personally. I think that once you are part of a company, it means you are part of a greater family that strives for the same goal. SEC is the perfect example of that. During the presentations of the club, every single member was so supportive of each other and seemed to still be very organized. I think that this is an environment in which I could thrive and continue to support others around me by contributing not only my time but also my skills of compassion. Furthermore, I also want to continue helping others in need during my time in the industry by organizing events in which coworkers can help donate their time as well to the public.",
            "Question 10": "During the summer of 2022, the Mathnasium branch I worked at was financially unprofitable. Determined to find a solution, I proposed the idea of a summer camp. The camp was led by a team of three and consisted of 4 week-long sessions covering topics like subtraction and Pythagorean theorem proofs. I collaborated with two employees to create new content for students while maintaining a captivating format. As a Mathnasium instructor, inclusivity and engagement were my main focuses. I used games and prizes to incentivize students to focus on understanding the material and added an exciting twist to regular math. By gamifying the learning experience, I created an environment where students felt comfortable asking questions about concepts they struggled with without judgment and instilled a growth mindset into the students so they could come to love math as I do. It was simple to stay focused because I was able to see a visible impact on the students that I helped. This is the same as the SEC because they have the authority to create change within their community, which is visible to all. SEC allows me to continue empowering those around me as I have done in the past."

The goal of most students coming into college is to gain knowledge and skills that will let them gain a job in their desired field. As a freshman engineering student, I have experienced the uncertainty of looking at internships and realizing that I do not have the skills most companies require. Having more chances for freshmen to learn skills most companies look for will aid them in jump-starting their career in engineering. The field of engineering has an infinite number of skills to learn and is continuously developing, making it difficult for students to keep up with the latest advancements. Providing Texas A&M students with opportunities to learn these skills before they start looking for internships or jobs will give them an advantage over students from other schools.",
            "Question 9": "My long-term professional goal is to work in the aerospace/aerospace defense industry. I plan to incorporate a passion for helping others into this field in two ways, improvements on weapon systems and reducing the impact to the planet of aircraft. Improving weapons systems means being able to best protect the citizens of a country while minimizing the damage done to an opposing country and the civilians not involved in the conflict. I plan on reducing the environmental impact of aircraft by working to responsibly source materials used in the production of aircraft while also improving aircraft design to decrease emissions. This will ensure that the planet is sustained for future generations.\nBeing passionate about helping others contributes to the mission of the SEC because everything that the Council does is in the interest of other engineering students. The SEC works to provide a voice to engineering students that they may not otherwise have. Additionally, they help engineering students grow academically and professionally so that they are prepared for the professional world. SEC members do all of this without looking for anything in return which is why it is necessary for members to be devoted to selflessly helping others.",
            "Question 10": "One of my greatest achievements is getting my Eagle Scout rank, in which I encountered a wide variety of roadblocks on my way to accomplishing. A main component of achieving this rank is leading others which faced a major obstacle in Covid-19, which caused all in-person activities to stop and made it difficult to keep other members active. In order to mitigate the impact of this, I had to come up with engaging activities that could be done via Zoom while still helping others move forward with their own ranks. This roadblock was easily overcome by collaborating with my peers to figure out what activities and skills they wanted to work on and others who had been in my position and how they would implement these ideas. The other main roadblock I faced was finishing my Eagle Scout project. Within that I encountered problems with finalizing a plan, finding materials, and getting the project approved so that work could begin. The main step I took to keep working toward my goal was working with others who I could discuss different ideas to deal with each roadblock and coming up with a solution that worked."

I would also take joy in encouraging my fellow Texas A&M engineers during E-Week, knowing how it has inspired and uplifted me personally!",
            "Question 9": "As I acquire experience in the workforce, one of my long term goals is to mentor aspiring engineers. I have personally encountered challenges in college with finding accomplished engineers to provide guidance about my professional journey. Unlike many of my peers, I lack a familial network in engineering, which puts me at a disadvantage to those who do have parents who can give advice on which internships to apply for, what classes to take, or whether or not they should go to graduate school immediately or enter the workforce first. This is why the opportunity to mentor upcoming engineers who were raised under similar circumstances holds great personal significance to me. I can be their unofficial \u2018engineering parent\u2019, offering support and advice that one would only know from experience. This professional goal aligns with the all three pillars of the Student Engineers\u2019 Council Mission Statement. As a mentor, I would represent practiced engineers, increase awareness of the numerous opportunities that engineers can take part in, and foster professional growth and prosperity among my mentees!",
            "Question 10": "During Big Little week last semester, my goal was to give my little an unforgettable experience no matter how much effort it took, knowing that she would only get this opportunity once in her life. Just before reveal week, something unexpected happened: I was given two littles! Of course I wanted both of their experiences to be equally great, but now I had twice the preparation to complete. On top of that, the week was academically heavy with tests, meetings, and projects due, and social commitments every night ranging from Breakaway volunteering to Songfest practice. Still, I was determined to make sure that my little and her counterpart had an exceptional week. I balanced my time creatively, brainstormed new ideas for two girls instead of one, and even made some personal sacrifices (sleep!) to make sure their experience was perfect. Looking back, I take pride in what I accomplished as I managed to orchestrate a memorable week, excel academically, and fulfill all of my commitments. Now, this experience encourages me when I know that busy times lie ahead, as that week was a testament to my ability to thrive during the busiest of times."

            "Question 9": "I was taught the importance of helping others. My mother is a social worker so being a part of my community and making a difference has always been an important part of my life and my identity. I won the Saint Catherine of Siena Service Award four years in high school. I volunteered at domestic violence/homeless shelters, food banks, and senior adult centers. At my church I delivered groceries and volunteered for vacation Bible School. I understand the value of service to others and strive to find ways to incorporate this value into my professional life.\nHonestly, I do not have a very clear picture of what my professional life will eventually be. However, I know I will always incorporate my belief in the value of volunteerism into my life. I will always believe that it is my duty to serve others. Service is more than actions \u2013 it is an attitude. An attitude of humbling myself and being ready to put other\u2019s needs before my own. I am not always successful in achieving this attitude. However, working toward this goal is something I will never give up on. This desire and this attitude is what I bring to the SEC.

I was friends with everyone in my grade, but I was especially close to my fellow teammates. After coming off a playoff loss during our junior year, we dedicated ourselves to winning a state championship our senior year.\nOur senior season was off to an exceptional start. We won all games up to the semifinals, and we all expected to win the state championship. However, a week before the semifinal game, we received devastating news. One of our key players, and a close friend, had an accident and was no longer able to play football. This news filled our entire team with shock and worry. However, this situation motivated us to develop a mindset of selflessness. We no longer ran, lifted weights, and won for ourselves but for each other and our injured teammate. This new mindset caused a noticeable change in our characters. We were able to win the state championship that year, however the greatest take away from that season was the growth in character which we all experienced together."

            "Question 9": "Previously, I interned at SEWA International where I dedicated over 80 hours to aid underpaid refugee families with education, food, and housing. During my time there, the organization had issues with sufficient food distribution. To combat this issue, I started talking to the Houston Food Bank for volunteer opportunities in making food boxes with fresh produce and a portion of that would be sent directly to the families my internship was working with. After many back-and-forth meetings, the food bank agreed to the proposal and we were able to continue our service to the refugee families. My passion for helping others will continue throughout my professional experiences in the industry. This experience not only deepened my outlook on societal needs but also highlighted the importance of engagement in the community. Engineering is not solely about technical solutions but it is also about addressing the real world challenges faced by people in the world. In SEC, I plan to utilize these experiences to increase initiatives that promote social responsibility and therefore increasing engineering awareness and fostering professional advancement. These two pillars of SEC focus on giving back to the community through hosting Envision conference and Engineer's week.

On the first day, my manager listed the softwares that would be necessary to get this website running; unfamiliar terms like Tomcat, Spring Boot, and Node JS sounded gibberish to me. Fortunately, my team and I researched online workshops and crash courses that would help us understand how to operate the software. We progressively started to understand the basis of each program and used that in the back-end and front-end of our web application. It was easy to lose track because the new information seemed overwhelming but to stay focused I made a priority task list and a detailed project plan. I also developed informal relationships with my team so that we could motivate each other. At SEC, I believe that I will be able to grow and have many new skills to obtain like public speaking and etiquette. From this experience, I learned that there is always room for growth and that I should not be afraid but instead embrace it with a warm welcome."

College is a period of self-improvement and self-discovery, and ultimately what we are here to do is prepare ourselves for the rest of our lives. Which, personally, scares me. And I do not think that I am alone. This pillar is so significant because it means that the SEC helps guide quality students through their college career and ensures that everyone can have their questions answered. When this pillar is put into action, students feel safer and supported because there is a group of people that can help prepare them for a life after college. After I graduate, I want to feel confident in my professional abilities because that is what I will have to depend on, so knowing that the SEC can help me reach that point lessens my uncertainty.",
            "Question 9": "The goal of almost every single job in society is to do something that will help people or improve people's lives. Otherwise, there would be no reason for that job to have been created. I wish to ETAM into computer science because of the increasingly prominent role it will play in society. My goal for the future is to work with AI to expand the range of what it could do for us. I would like to work with nonprofit organizations to aid them in their missions; the two problems I want to be able to focus on are using AI to advance the education system in underrepresented communities by incorporating AI into that system if teachers are unavailable and using AI to aid in disaster relief relating to natural disasters/wars/communities that are in some other troubling situation. The way to make your mark on the world is by affecting other people (hopefully in a positive way), and I want to start making my mark on this world through the SEC. I think it would be interesting to develop an AI program to aid in the mission of the SEC: an addition to the SEC website that allows A&M engineering students to ask questions about any aspect of engineering, including classes, SEC events such as career fairs or engineers' week, and tips for landing internships and making professional developments. This could also be a place for all engineering students to input their own ideas or improvements for events/programs.",
            "Question 10": "I am a terrible public speaker. My face turns bright red (and I can feel it turning red), and I slowly talk faster and faster until I am out of breath and people have to really listen to understand me. If I have to speak in front of a class of twenty people, I will be thinking about it all week. At my high school graduation, I had to give a speech in front of everyone. My graduating class had only 140 people, and every student was allowed to bring ten guests. So I was obviously thinking about this speech for a while in advance. But this was the last time I will probably ever see most of my classmates, so I was determined to do a good job. I worked with my school's theater teacher to practice the speech, and to combat my incredibly fast talking, I focused on speaking very slowly and enunciating every word. I would recite the speech five times a night to my mom for the entire week beforehand. I annotated my pages and wrote down tips to remember as I was speaking. The preparation was worth it - apparently I did a good job."

            "Question 8": "The pillar of SEC that I believe most resonates with me is the goal of fostering professional advancements of all engineering students. As engineering students transition into becoming engineers, the catalyst of that transformation is professional development. I, like many other students, have ambitious career goals that require significant amounts of experience in a professional setting to achieve. Getting that work experience isn\u2019t easy. Students like myself that have little to no professional experience are like navigating unknown waters. When SEC hosts events such as career fairs, resume workshops, or other professional events, engineering students like myself have tremendous opportunities to develop confidence in themselves, get experience networking, and overall become more knowledgeable of the professional sphere. This invaluable medium that SEC provides has the potential to be the little spark that gets a student like me a first job or internship and on their way to achieving career goals.",
            "Question 9": "Engineers have the power to change the world. Because I recognize this fact, I am intimately aware of my duty to help others or the world become a better place through my career. One of my career objectives is to work towards a more sustainable future. Sustainability quite literally benefits everyone that lives on planet Earth; whether it be improved overall health, better economies, or social equity. In working towards that goal of helping others through saving the planet , I have already even started to help conduct research for a professor working towards developing biorenewable technologies. I plan to use this experience to better understand the energy industry, and eventually work my way up to management where I can influence policy related to sustainability. Having the medium of SEC would allow me to promulgate my goals to other engineers and inspire them to become ambitious like I am. Having benevolent goals like these adds greatly to the prestige of the engineering profession, and ultimately makes Texas A&M engineering students more desirable in terms of the professional sphere. In addition to facilitating engineering programs and events, I want to help other engineers understand their value in being able to help humanity as well. I think this goes hand in hand with \u201cincreasing engineering awareness\u201d, as I believe engineers should use their profession and careers not just as a means to accumulate wealth, but to truly make the world a better place.",
            "Question 10": "Getting a job is a lot harder than it seems. Rejection email after rejection email taught me the hard way. I thought I could just send in a few job applications, get invited to interviews, and walk out the door with an internship. The only thing I obtained was disappointment. After unsuccessfully applying for internships last Fall, It became apparent to me that the most significant impediment to obtaining a job was myself. I simply was not a good enough candidate. In the spring, I knew that I had to differentiate myself from other candidates , and I refused to let rejection and discouragement be the end of the story. So I pressed on. I contacted professors about helping them conduct research and thankfully got a position, which gave me some work experience. I went from applying to \u201cfew\u201d jobs to over 300 for better chances. For the interview invitations I did receive, I prepared for hours and hours until I felt that I could confidently convey myself to recruiters. The prodigious steps that I took, in the face of discouragement and rejection, culminated in me getting multiple job offers and the next step to my career goals."

However, in my professional career, I would love to take lead on large coding projects and have the opportunity to write code while managing a team of intelligent minds. I enjoy taking initiative because it allows me to assist every member of my committee to help not only them, but the team as a whole succeed. I am also trusted to be the representative voice for the team for any questions, concerns, or even alternative solutions. As a project manager, I would also be allowed to hire interns to work alongside my team.

            "Question 10": "Outside of the classroom, my biggest time commitment was playing basketball. It was always hard to play physically because of how skinny I was. When I had a lot more time available over quarantine, I decided to begin the journey of putting on muscle.\nThe first major roadblock I hit was motivation. I got a few home gym weights, but I would cut workouts short, or completely, because I always found some excuse. This cycle continued throughout the entirety of quarantine, and when basketball picked back up, I stopped lifting completely again.\nAbout two years later, it began to affect my mental health. I got a gym membership, but quickly ran into the roadblock of discipline. It was difficult to stay consistent with basketball, AP\u2019s, and college applications. After multiple attempts, I fixed my sleep schedule to wake up at 6 a.m. every morning to lift before school. Improving my time management skills greatly contributed to me learning discipline and prioritizing healthier lifestyle habits. My motivation was going to bed knowing that I bettered myself by 1% that day. Over a year I bulked fifty, healthy pounds, and am still going to the gym every single day."

I was lucky enough to have my efforts land me an internship with an engineering consulting firm this past break, and it was a grand opportunity for growth and exposure to the professional world. I was a witness and victim of the tremendous gap between the professional knowledge I thought I had versus what I actually had. There is no doubt that engineers are incredibly intelligent, but how to hold and elevate yourself professionally doesn\u2019t get taught through a calculus class but through experience and exposure. I believe the internship has advanced me professionally and has given me an asset that will benefit me career-wise, and anyone who encounters such opportunities will also benefit. The SEC\u2019s dedication to supplying these opportunities for their students resonates with me and is greatly appreciated.",
            "Question 9": "The best way to incorporate such passion is by reminding myself that the people who helped me get to where I am had that passion and then actively giving back. I believe that passion comes from appreciation and realization of the power of what that is you\u2019re passionate about. When you have such a creditable image by making yourself available to help, people take you seriously and wish to hear you out, which feeds right into the pillar of the SEC to be a representative voice for engineers. Then going out and outwardly presenting yourself as a helping hand builds an image of yourself and all that you are involved in, so for SEC members to help others, people will associate the SEC with people of good hearts and standards. And lastly, by helping others, you create a reputable image; people will want to be around you, talk to you, and work with you. That is the basis of networking, and with networking comes opportunities for professional advancement. I have benefited professionally from actively helping others. This past summer, I went back as an alumni to help out my high school robotics team; a sponsor company was impressed and offered me an internship. My intention was merely to help out the team that helped me grow practically and personally, and by doing so ardently, I was approached with a new opportunity. I never know who is watching me when, so the best I can do is always offer my best.",
            "Question 10": "As silly as it sounds, one experience outside of the classroom that required substantial commitment from me was learning how to crochet a blanket for a newborn. About two weeks before my cousin's birth, I told my uncle that I was going to learn to crochet and then crochet a baby blanket for them. He had expressed some slight doubts about this new project of mine, but I had given him my word, and I was going to keep it. I, however, underestimated the difficulty of crocheting. It had become one of the hardest things I had to learn. The first blanket came unraveled from the middle, I had run out of yarn by my second attempt at the blanket, and by the third, ten days in, there was no time for restarts. After hours of hooking, unraveling, and rolling yarn, did I have a blanket? Yeah, if you looked at it abstractly. Was it the best thing ever? Absolutely not, but it was complete, and my aunt and uncle adored it, and I was delighted I didn\u2019t have to show up empty handed. Despite wanting to give up multiple times, the emotional payoff was hard but worth it."

These opportunities to contribute ideas and enact tangible changes have inspired my desire to join SEC.\nAs someone actively seeking professional development opportunities, I'm eager to contribute to SEC's efforts in advancing the careers of engineering students. In joining SEC, I look forward to not only experiencing the organization's valuable opportunities but also actively contributing to its mission.",
            "Question 9": "In my long-term professional goals, I plan to incorporate my passion for helping others by actively seeking opportunities to mentor and support fellow engineers, particularly those who may feel lost at the beginning of their journey as engineers.\nWhen I first joined engineering at Texas A&M University, I didn't know what engineers do in our society or what kind of engineer I wanted to become. However, through conversations with fellow and upper-class engineers, I gained insight into the various fields of engineering and found my path to becoming an impactful engineer.\nI believe fostering a supportive and inclusive environment is essential for the growth and success of all engineers. By dedicating myself to initiatives aimed at providing resources and guidance to students who need help finding their path in college or facing challenges in their academic or professional pursuits, I aim to contribute to a more equitable and thriving engineering community.\nWithin the SEC, I see opportunities to further cultivate this passion and contribute to the council's missions. By engaging in mentorship programs and initiatives aimed at engaging engineering communities, I hope to inspire future generations of engineers and use my passion to support the missions. One idea I have is to initiate an event like \"Chat with Fellow Engineers,\" where freshmen can learn about different engineering majors from upperclassmen students and gain insights into real-life experiences within those majors.\nMoreover, as joining SEC, I hope to contribute to creating a community where all engineering students feel valued and supported in their engineering journey.",

Despite our lack of prior knowledge of website development and coding languages, we approached the task with determination.\nAs freshmen, we had no prior experience of Hackathons and coding beyond basic coursework. Additionally, the complexity of web development posed a significant obstacle.\nTo overcome these challenges, we meticulously planned our learning approach. This helped us stay organized and accountable throughout the process. We began by watching introductory tutorials on website development and utilizing resources such as ChatGPT and Stack Overflow for guidance.\nDespite the fact that none of us had prior experience or knowledge regarding developing websites, we successfully developed a \"Your Best Restaurant Finder\" website within the allotted time frame, achieving our goal.\nReflecting on the experience, I gained invaluable insights into problem-solving, collaboration, and the iterative nature of project development."

The workshop\u2019s goal was to better prepare students for the ETAM application process, helping over one hundred engineering students with the support of student organizations, the Associate Dean for Engineering at Galveston, academic advisors, and professors. However, organizing an event on such a large scale presents challenges.\nThe hardest challenge I faced with this event was communication. Despite a clear delegation of tasks, there were issues when one of the advertising groups failed to promote the event at an agreed-upon time. I had to address this by clarifying my expectations and how we were going to get back on track by rescheduling their promotional time. I also took it on myself to create a step-by-step guide for future representatives who would put this event on in the future to prevent incidents like this.\nWhen faced with challenges, solutions can always be found. After our discussion, any further missteps were avoided, leading to a successful event and high turnout."

            "Question 9": "In my pursuit of becoming a software engineer at Google, Meta, or Netflix, my long-term professional goals are deeply intertwined with a passion for helping others succeed. Alongside being a software engineer, I plan on mentoring students and hosting outreach events. As I progress through this journey, I will share any insights gained and look to make an impact on future engineers by giving back.\nAdditionally, I recently dipped my toes in being a public speaker. I spoke at a webinar with over 300 attendees. I spoke about my fall recruitment season, professional journey, and gave advice during a Q&A session. I cite this because I love giving people advice and find great joy in seeing others develop and succeed. I would love to continue doing this long term by speaking at events, hosting workshops, and by connecting students to valuable resources.\nThis commitment seamlessly aligns with the mission of the SEC. Like the SEC, I want to see others succeed. This entails advocating for our fellow engineers, inspiring professional development, and raising engineering awareness. I can actively uphold this commitment by participating in one of the various committees within the SEC. To name a few, this includes the career fair committee, engineering development committee, or internal relations committee.

Stepping forward and looking at my long-term goals, I know that I want to thrive in a profession that helps people. Something my dad says is being a problem solver is \u201cBringing order to chaos\u201d, and that has something that has really stuck with me, although many things in life and this department are far from chaotic, they can be improved. Good is subjective and means many different things to different people. I want to be exceptional, and in order to do that through engineering, I need to learn how to solve problems that people present not just mathematically, but also socially and through forms of communication in a professional manner. Learning to be well rounded can help contribute to the SEC because it will help build a strong skill set of communication and coordination that can be beneficial to the mission statement of being the voice, through communication with fellow aggies and understanding any problems they may face, and fostering professional advancement by learning how to speak in a professional manner it will help with the logistical communication with companies that are looking to hire our aggies.",

As a senior myself I wanted to create events and memories for fellow classmates that they would cherish as we wrapped up our final year as high school students. However, the hard part was not coming up with ideas, it was getting the ideas approved by the administration. Facing the battle of the approval of my classmates but the disapproval of administration was one of the most difficult things about serving on student council. As an officer, there was a standard I was held to, but as a student I knew how not getting the ideas that were trending approved was extremely disheartening however with teamwork between my fellow officers and our advisors and compromising on both ends we were able to come up with activities that students were excited about, and administration felt comfortable hosting. It was important to keep the integrity of the events and make them something that students would actually enjoy and attend, this was the main factor of focus as we negotiated our way to a compromise that everyone enjoyed in the end."

            "Question 8": "The mission that resonates with me the most is the mission to increase engineering awareness through its programs and events. The reason this particular pillar resonates with me the most is because I know many students who are engineers who face many mental health issues that are often overlooked. I also had one of my closest friends who was also an engineer lose his life due to the mental health issues he faced in addition to the stress of the engineering workload. I feel like there are too many engineers who have a negative perception of speaking with others about their mental well-being and are less likely to go seek help when they need it most. I want to assist in any way if it helps spread awareness of some of the more overlooked aspects of engineering.",
            "Question 9": "My long-term professional goal is to end up working with medical technology to make it more efficient and more accessible to the public. I think that by making medical technology more efficient it will also decrease the cost to operate and end up saving more people money when it comes to medical expenses. Improvements to diagnostic machines like an MRI can cause them to be more prevalent in basic care if they are less expensive and that will increase the likelihood of catching serious medical issues before they become too big of a problem. Decreasing the cost of medical equipment by making designs more efficient and reliable also allows for equipment to be more readily available in poorer countries to increase the scope of care available to citizens in less developed countries. By leading by example there I can inspire other engineers to work on projects that have a greater impact on the common person which would increase public awareness of engineers and what they do.",
            "Question 10": "When I was in high school I was vice president of my school's robotics club which competed in the FIRST Tech Challenge. I had a lot of responsibilities as vice president outside such as managing meeting times, planning events, keeping track of attendance, and keeping development of the robot on track. Even though I had many administrative tasks to worry about I still wanted to participate in the building of the robot, however, I found myself struggling to make time. To be able to contribute to the progression of the robot I worked with the teacher who sponsored the club to work on it during my lunch period and during and found worked on the robot during weekends at home. To maintain a healthy balance of school and extracurriculars I made a hard schedule of times to do homework and planned meetings with my teachers to help me with homework so I did not waste time being stuck on homework questions. Even though it was hard at times I always found a way to stay dedicated to putting my free time into working on the robot by imagining how proud everyone would be if our team made it to state."

            "Question 8": "The pillar from the SEC Mission Statement that resonates with me the most is being the representative voice of all engineering students. Because there are thousands of engineering students at Texas A&M, it's difficult for students to get their personal voices heard in the large College of Engineering. The Student Engineers' Council is a medium between each student and the College of Engineering. It listens to the wants and needs of engineering students and informs the heads of the department of the student's issues. This resonates with me deeply because I had strong concerns last semester and being able to express them in the survey allowed me to feel heard. I felt that there were fellow students that cared about my problems and wanted to address them. The SEC provides a voice to each engineering student, which is what inspires me most about the organization.",
            "Question 9": "I have always had a passion for helping others. Whether it was participating in a service event or volunteering to tutor my peers afterschool, I was there. This was one of my inspirations for becoming an engineer; I wanted to design new products that would improve the lives of others and improve on current products. One specific industry that I've always been interested in is biomedical devices. Millions of people across the world depend on medical devices daily to improve their quality of life. Whether it's an inhaler or pacemaker, each device has been meticulously designed to make the lives of others more comfortable. I want to be a part of this process, and help others by providing them a more comfortable and enriching life. I can contribute this to the mission of the Student Engineers' Council by working to raise awareness of the importance of engineering in general. Although most people stereotypically think that engineers just build gadgets and do math all throughout the day, I want to bring attention to the amazing achievements engineers make everyday. Having awareness events would allow others to realize and appreciate just how important engineering is to daily society.",
            "Question 10": "Throughout my entire life, I've always been drawn to the cello. Anytime I would watch the school orchestra, all I could pay attention to was the cellists and the beautiful sound that was coming from their section. I decided that I would teach myself how to play the cello, and began my journey. After researching for weeks and searching through multiple shops, I found my perfect cello. I began to learn, depending on YouTube videos and beginner practice books. My first week of learning ended with the skin on my fingers blistering from the metal strings and me feeling defeated. Although I wanted to give up, I knew that wasn't the right thing to do. I had just started, and knew that progress takes time. So with a band-aid on my finger and a newfound determination, I spent the next couple of weeks practicing daily. Day by day, my skills improved and I became more motivated seeing my progress. Eventually, I achieved my goal of teaching myself to play the cello through much perseverance and hard work."

            "Question 10": "Embarking on a fishing adventure revealed my commitment beyond the classroom, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Patience became a major roadblock as hours passed without a single catch. Meanwhile, my younger brother effortlessly reeled in fish while I struggled. Rather than letting it get me down, I turned it into a teamwork opportunity. Learning from his success became a collaborative effort rather than a competition.\nThe hurdle of adapting to different baits deepened the challenge. Initially sticking with the familiar, I hoped for success. Recognizing the need for improvement, I decided to switch things up. Trying a new bait, as I would spend time researching, and inquiring from others at the lake. This shift underscored my commitment to mastering new techniques and refining my skills.\nTo stay dedicated, I embraced setbacks as valuable learning opportunities, celebrating small wins along the way. Fishing evolved into a purposeful pursuit of mastery, not just as a leisure activity but as a practical lesson in persistence, adaptability, and personal growth. Alas, in the grand comedy of my fishing saga, I've yet to convince a fish that I'm worth the nibble."

Students like ourselves are in a unique position in society, where the decisions that we make can fully change the outlook of our community. Much like we rely on our parents or elders now, we hold the same responsibility to the generation after us. Engineers at A&M\u2014and those in SEC especially\u2014uphold this standard very well, as they have put themselves in the best position to provide for others in their future. I believe that students like myself should make it their goal to encourage the growth of future engineers, and I hope to expand on this mission through participating in many of the programs that the SEC conducts to help foster the advancement of students within the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 9": "From an early age I\u2019ve volunteered at the Boys & Girls Club of Dallas. Through my time teaching basic math or pickup basketball, I formed many special bonds during my time at the center\u2014with one student in particular telling me that I was the only reason they still came every week. Learning that he felt that way about my participation in their activities taught me how much my presence in the Club meant to those children. Ever since, I have always tried to help others when I can, awaiting the chance to take part in helping the community around me. I have found a sense of familiarity within the Student Engineers Council's goals, as the mission they pursue revolves around helping others. The focus on providing an executive body for the advancement of Engineering students at Texas A&M, as well as the community as a whole resonates deeply with the ideals I have been striving to uphold. The work that the SEC does with programs like EnVision or REACH focus on bettering the lives of future generations\u2014through education, awareness, etc. As a member of the SEC, I hope to stay involved as I further my own professional journey, and pass on the knowledge that I gain to others.",
            "Question 10": "The journey to reach a six-minute mile surprisingly became a defining chapter in my life, and illustrated a challenge of grit and determination that I had not realized I needed outside of the classroom. A series of carefully structured training plans and ideally planned rest days outlined my schedule for weeks, but I could never seem to decrease my time. I soon started waking up with a feeling of dread, knowing that I could miss the mark by just one or two seconds. A surprise invite from my brother to join on his morning run turned out to save me from this struggle, as I found myself pushing the hardest I ever had that session\u2014almost unknowingly. The sense of motivation and camaraderie that he brought turned my solitary pursuit into a collective one and opened me up to visualizing my success, turning my momentary discomfort into one of greater achievement. Ultimately, I realized the process of breaking this seemingly insurmountable behavior was not merely a physical accomplishment, but a testament to the focus, determination, and unwavering belief that any challenge can be conquered"

This pillar resonates with me the most, because during this fall semester, the Career Fair run by the SEC gave me the opportunity to interact with countless different engineering companies, which helped me land an internship at Texas Instruments. My successful experience from attending the Career Fair has made me realize the importance of opportunities for professional growth and advancement, and I am now able to recognize the value in organizations such as the SEC in facilitating these opportunities. The internship that I have received this summer is a tangible outcome of the SEC's efforts, and I am glad to be able to appreciate the importance of the SEC and its work.",
            "Question 9": "I plan on incorporating a passion for helping others into my long-term professional goals, as one of my goals in the future is to organize outreach programs in the future for high school and college students that not only promote engineering but also highlight it as a societal impact. I particularly want to arrange STEM workshops for underprivileged schools that will inspire the next generation. By using my passion for helping others, I can infuse these initiatives with empathy and a sense of purpose, making them much more meaningful and impactful. My passion for helping others and organizing such outreach events contributes to the mission of the SEC, because more work needs to be done to increase engineering awareness. More students need to be exposed to the engineering world and its benefits at an early age, and I want to motivate and support individuals who may not otherwise consider engineering as a viable option. More diversity needs to foster within the engineering field in order to ensure that engineering as a whole reflects the broader society that it serves. I hope that in the future, I am able to be apart of this change.",
            "Question 10": "A past experience where I demonstrated a strong commitment to achieving a goal outside of the classroom was when I won at a national level singing competition in Cleveland. I have been learning Indian Classical Music for the past 10 years and the only goal that I had was to win a prize at this annual competition in Cleveland. However, things went downhill as I tore my ACL/Meniscus 3 months before the competition. I was devastated, but I was too committed to my goal. I vigorously started practiced everyday for 3 months while balancing rehab as well as continuous doctor visits. I also attended classes with my teacher thrice a week despite having crutches. It was a painful but rewarding experience. I wanted to give up and just focus on competing next year, but I was able to keep myself focused by talking to my parents and teacher. They motivated to never give up and to stay true to my hard work. I took their advice and worked as hard as I can. A month later, I eventually ended up being able to compete, and I succeeded in achieving my dream and won third place."

            "Question 8": "The mission of SEC to foster the professional advancement of all the engineering students within the College of Engineering resonates the most with me. During the entirety of my college application process, I was divided between attending either Texas A&M or The University of Texas at Austin. The driving factor in coming to A&M was hearing about the \"Aggie connection\" and how \"Aggies hire Aggies\" through the relationships that they build. What all college students want out of upon graduation, is to have a stable job in the career field that they want to work in and whether its speaking with future employers at the career fairs or the industry nights, SEC prepares students to strive in the professional field while creating these high-quality applicants. This is what resonates with me as I want to be a part of that organization that helps to develop those future leaders in engineering.",
            "Question 9": "There are multiple definitions of leadership and some may argue, one is more accurate than another. While there are multiple definitions of leadership, I think leadership starts at the foundation. By building your team from the ground up and being that strong support, you are better able to lead and have higher quality production. I have always tried to pursue this form of leadership whenever I was put in such positions. As a leader or just a teammate, I always cared for those around me to succeed first and thrive rather than only focusing on my own agenda. I believe that being passionate about helping others and seeing them succeed, also allows you to succeed and grow in most aspects. This is what I want to carry on into my future profession. As an officer in the Air Force, leading with the passion to help others, I can be that open ear to take advice and criticism from those in my unit to better set them up to succeed in the future while also being able to produce at high levels. As an engineer, helping voice the ideas of my colleagues would allow for better results in projects we work on. This would all be rooted from SEC as my passion to be an open ear and to help others succeed before my own, would allow for the representation of all my fellow engineering classmates and for them to succeed in the professional advancement.",
            "Question 10": "To be a cadet in the Corps, all freshmen are required to pass a cumulative final \"exam\", testing the knowledge and training you have done to that point to earn something called brass. In a three weeklong test, freshman are expected to perfectly demonstrate all the knowledge that they have acquired in the past semester to prove to their upperclassmen that they have become proficient cadets and are able to work together as a class to overcome any obstacle and excel. All I wanted was for my class to prove to the upperclassmen that we were deserving to be there. It of course did not come easy as nothing we did was ever right or perfect in their eyes and all we did was mess up no matter what. The constant pressure that we weren't doing good was demoralizing. However, the drive to prove myself and the class of 27 was far greater as that led to countless more hours, staying up practicing to be perfect. I needed to be the one that could help my classmates succeed. All that was in my mind was us getting that brass, and through all of that, we finally achieved that recognition."

Giving students the confidence in their ability to submit an application, improve their resume, or nail an interview is something that I am passionate about, because I understand the anxiety that a lot of students have with this regard. For a long time I didn\u2019t really understand how to make a proper resume or how to seem confident in an interview, and only by exposure and action, did I get comfortable with the prospect of interviews. I am passionate about professional development because improving the professionalism of students will help them for years to come.",
            "Question 9": "I would incorporate my passion for helping other students into interacting with students one-to-one so as to better get their perspectives on what the college of engineering is doing well, okay, and badly. Without proper personal input from the students, the SEC cannot hope to properly serve the student body, and so I would use my passion to further close the gap between the faculty and the student population. The simplest way to do this is to request feedback on any major events, for example Career Fair, and to encourage students to levy their frustrations and criticisms at those who can change it, instead of making snide remarks amongst themselves. Another way to get feedback from students is by hosting studying and tutoring events. If twenty students were all to come in and not understand a particular section from Calculus 2 by example, it is a very clear red flag that the professor(s) for that course are teaching that subject inadequately. This furthers my professional goals as I will likely receive a lot of feedback in the workplace, and to be able to distill that feedback into something that is positive for myself is vital for my professional development. I plan to incorporate my passion for helping others into my professional goals by giving a voice to students, and using their feedback to properly improve their experience at the College of Engineering.",
            "Question 10": "After sending in a number of applications to internships, I became increasingly aware of how important a proper coding background is in the highly competitive environment for a summer internship. I remarked this to my good friend Bryan, and we both resolved to learn C++ over the break, and to keep each other accountable. At first, this promise seemed to vaporize the second we arrived home, as we were swamped with reunions and events, but as the dust of the initial wave of excitement from break settled, we started working together again. Our system was simple: at some point in the day we would work 30-60 mins on coding using a free website, and by around dinner time, we would update each other on the process. It wasn\u2019t overly complex, but it needn\u2019t be. Soon, the routine became a habit, and the updates ceased as they were unnecessary. At the moment I am still working towards my certification, but by cooperating with someone I trusted, we were both able to reach our goal of learning C++ over the break."

Complimented by the ability to effectively communicate in a professional setting, these skills will successfully contribute to the success in securing internships and eventually career attaining.\nSEC will allow me to help play a pivotal role by exposing students to real-world engineering environments that will provide a connection between classroom knowledge and its application in the industry. By actively facilitating these experiences, the SEC can provide the next generation of engineers with a proficient skillset to make a powerful impact on the world.",
            "Question 9": "A goal for any and all engineers should be to help the community and solve problems for the future. As an engineer, this can be done through a multitude of ways such as working towards solving the 14 Grand Challenges, education and inspiration of the youth, or just being socially responsible and beneficial to their niche in the community. As a chemical engineering major, I hope to go into the recycling of plastics to reduce the waste problem in the world or creating more efficient biofuels which would help reduce carbon emissions. I think it is important to showcase the importance of community building among the engineering students at Texas A&M.\nEveryone has big dreams to help the world in one way or another in the engineering world, but what I\u2019ve learned throughout my time here at Texas A&M is that working on a team is important in the industry. When working on a team you will have the opportunity to work with a diverse group from a multitude of backgrounds so I believe it is vital to have a good foundation of teamwork and collaboration. If students are constantly participating in programs and activities within a community it will allow them to be more comfortable in being a leader or working on a team in general.

Early in school, I fell into a cycle of school, studying, and sleeping to reach my idea of success. It was not until I joined the Boy Scouts in my sophomore year of high school that I found myself striving for more every single day.\nAlthough I joined scouting years later than my peers I felt a personal need to achieve the highest rank of Eagle Scout held by 4% of all scouts. I found myself embracing challenges, fostering leadership, and appreciating all the outdoors had to give us. Along with the short time frame to become an Eagle (before age 18), I dealt with COVID and a change in leadership in my troop. I navigated the rocky terrain, giving up weekends, learning new skills, and communicating with leadership to allow me to efficiently complete all the requirements and earn my Eagle Scout Rank. Through focus, resilience, and a commitment to myself, I was able to grow as a person and achieve the Eagle Scout rank."

This was partly due to being hesitant when joining organizations. Not familiar with A&M culture, I failed to realize how crucial they were for my development. One of the reasons I want to join SEC is to help freshman kickstart their professional development. The transition into college can be overwhelming, resulting in a student's professional career being put aside. The vast majority of organizations also make it hard to know what to commit to. In the SEC, I would hope to work on already existing outreach programs to provide a more personal approach. All freshman should be given the opportunity to look back with pride at not only their academics but also their professional growth.",
            "Question 9": "My passion for helping people is highlighted when working in teams. Leading a team is where a person can do the most selfless work. The ideal leader to me, provides direction and facilitates team members to bring out their strengths. The beauty of this simple idea is sometimes lost within teams. My hope in the future is to be able to take on a position of leadership, whether it be at my job, community, or even within my own family. My focus would be to present a vulnerable and authentic style of leadership that makes everyone feel important. This ties in directly with the SEC's goal to represent the voices of all engineers. With the sheer amount of people that attend A&M for engineering, it is easy for a student to believe they are just another person in the crowd. The reality is, that everyone has a unique experience in background that in itself is a strength. Our community at A&M will only blossom from receiving a diverse range of opinions from the student body. It is important to encourage all students to voice their perspectives, but just as important to listen to those who struggle.",
            "Question 10": "One of my greatest non-academic challenges was learning how to play guitar. On day one, all I had was the wooden instrument, lacking a plan, a teacher, and any musical ability. My progress started surprisingly well, but I quickly ran into problems. Watching tutorials of my favorite songs, my guitar never sounded quite right. The music that I played was a mere shell of the real thing. This caused me to lose motivation, due to believing I needed a teacher to reach the next step. When I finally picked it up again, I decided to focus more on a direction than an end goal. I sought out practice material that covered skills used within my favorite songs. Every week, I would test my ability, and if it was not to my satisfaction, I would seek out new material and ditch the old. This self-regulation was key to my growth. The whole experience taught me that practice does not make perfect, it makes permanent. It is not enough to practice good habits within one's life, the real value comes from showing up and being intentional in how they are practiced."

            "Question 10": "Throughout my final high school years, I faced challenges staying active, primarily due to injuries in my hands, and despite resolving to hit the gym, I never made an effort to commit. However, after coming to Texas A&M, I began seeing the recreational centers as an easily accessible way to socialize and take breaks from the academic hustle. With this in mind, I wanted to stick to a workout split to slowly improve my mobility, strength, and physical health overall. However, several roadblocks, including exam weeks and stressful days in general, often challenged my commitment to the gym. Also, swelling in my leg made it difficult to push as hard as I wanted, discouraging me from working out. To stay dedicated, I utilized Google Calendar to manage my academics with gymming by allotting weekly time slots where early morning gym sessions before class became routine. I also researched and applied efficient recovery techniques, such as low-impact exercises to promote blood circulation in my leg. Over time, I told myself that consistency and adaptability, rather than expecting perfection in the gym every day, were key. Ultimately, my focus shifted to relying on discipline instead of motivation which helped me succeed."

            "Question 9": "One of the most beneficial opportunities offered by SEC is being able to contribute to other students's connection to the professional world by getting in contact with it myself. By helping others gain professional experience such as attending guest lectures, spreading awareness about events such as career fairs or just building connections amongst their peers in general, I would be honing my own soft skills by learning how to get in touch with companies, set up events and find where my interests lie in the industry. Previously in high school, I was secretary of my class, which gave me the opportunity to organize philanthropic and community-building events for our school. I learned how rewarding and engaging it was to help give back to my community and see my peers build their connections and get closer and I would be honored to continue this path with SEC. My long-term professional goals include building my connections with companies that I'm interested in and developing my soft skills to help with communication and collaboration. As one of the main pillars of SEC being fostering professional advancement, the act of providing students with more opportunities to contact and interact with industry directly correlates to the mission of Student Engineers' Council. I admire the pillars that SEC is built upon and would love to potentially see myself make an impact on the social and professional development of the community of rising engineers at A&M someday.",
            "Question 10": "In high school, I started as a member of my school's first all-girls robotics team, however, the time commitment was an obstacle for many team members, especially during the pandemic, causing our team to disintegrate. Taking the roles of Team Captain and club President, another teammate and I stuck through it and brought the team back to life with new members for the 2022-2023 season. We faced several hurdles such as a lack of funding, a lack of mentorship, and even a lack of participation from our members. As a female team captain, it was difficult to earn the respect of several club members. I learned that in order to see my dream of championing a tournament come true, I needed my team to take competition as seriously as I did, which meant gaining their respect and dedication, which is earned not given. So, I set my foot down and poured hours into educating our new members on the parts, game objectives, code, and the million other aspects that go into designing and competing with a robot and we finally championed our first tournament, won several more awards and eventually worked our way up to competing at the state level."

After all of that work, I was empty-handed. Could I still be a successful engineer?\nSEC has shown me that engineering goes beyond resumes and LinkedIns. Lost in the hectic transition into college, SEC and the engineering community made me feel secure that I could succeed in a new environment. Even just taking the freshman engineering survey, I felt like someone was listening after feeling lost with my distant 102 professor. Rather than solely finding value in extrinsic things, I was supported by the strong peer network at A&M. Seeing the amount of effort each member contributes, towards engineering and each other, makes the engineering awareness pillar stand out to me as one of the strongest examples of effective community building on campus.",
            "Question 9": "\"Only rain goes down the drain,\" was scrawled across the whiteboard in bright blue marker. As members of The Woodlands G.R.E.E.N., an environmental organization in my town, we were all too familiar with the problems facing our local waterways. I spent my Saturday mornings giving watershed demonstrations to middle schoolers and conducting water quality demonstrations, simultaneously connecting people with the environment and each other.\nWhile I didn\u2019t know Python or surface integrals at the time, I was employing principles of engineering every day; whether designing marketing initiatives or identifying pollution sources, I was working collaboratively with a team of passionate individuals to solve collective problems, a central tenet of engineering.\nThe true impact of engineering emerges through enacting meaningful, tangible change. In my career, I aim to use my chemical engineering degree to contribute to sustainable research and design projects. I will provide renewable energy to rural and energy-insecure communities through the development of decentralized microgrids, preserving and improving our relationship with nature and each other. I hope to be a catalyst for change, not only designing and improving the systems people rely on but also altering the approach we take towards engineering solutions.\nI believe my goals align greatly with the SEC\u2019s mission of promoting engineering awareness. While I won\u2019t be teaching girl scout troops about the importance of our local aquifers post-grad, I will continue to make a positive impact in engineering, the environment, and the communities I serve and belong to.",
            "Question 10": "The San Jacinto College gym fell silent as the clock ticked down to its final seconds. We watched with bated breath as the bots slowly lifted themselves to the bars. Suddenly, a crash echoed through the gymnasium\u2013 Our climber had snapped with only seconds left, our bot in pieces.\nAs mechanical lead, this was certainly my fault. Had we not done enough material testing? Had we worn out the climber during practice? My heartbeat and thoughts racing, I was soon reminded of the best resource I had: the collective resilience and ingenuity of my team.\nTogether we dissected the remains of the robot, hex wrenches and wire cutters flying. The stress of the past week of training had snapped the connectors between the climbing hook and the bot. Relying on the electrical team to reconnect the circuitry, the mechanical team to craft replacement hooks, and the programming team to adapt our autonomous code, we were able to compete in the competition and ended up advancing to the next round.\nWe were successful due to our team\u2019s dedication, cooperation, and adaptability. While our technical skills made our bot successful, our team identity and spirit carried us to the finals that year."

This specific department at A&M is huge and can be, at times, rather intimidating with its difficult and competitive academics. Talking amongst peers within the program, the main things that we noticed we wanted to improve was the atmosphere and community that we could utilize as freshmen entering this new realm. It can be cut-throat and unwelcoming at times, and I hope that within this club, I would get the opportunity to advocate for those in the engineering college about concerns or improvements that could be made for the overall betterment and growth of the department by pushing for a more uplifting community for all.",
            "Question 9": "With a large passion to help others succeed, I plan on taking that into the workforce as a biomedical engineer. I plan on providing and innovating new ways of medicine through research methods or potentially within the medical field itself. I am not certain about my exact goals for my future yet, but I do know that I want to help others in some way by utilizing the skills I learn as an engineer at A&M. I would love to pursue something in that realm of expertise because it takes good listening skills, compassion for others, and leadership abilities; all of which I hope to utilize and strengthen throughout my time in the Student Engineers\u2019 Council organization and throughout my career as well. Specifically with the Student Engineers\u2019 Council being in harmony with those goals, I hope that I can take advantage of this opportunity to learn more about employing a degree in engineering that contributes advantageous opportunities to enhance other\u2019s lives.

As a girl, I was looked at in a different light. Throughout high school, our drumline happened to be one of the most competitive instruments to try out for and succeed in, but as a freshman I was determined to make it. Everyday I would devote myself to practicing for hours in order to prepare myself enough to make the line. At the time, there had not been a girl snare drummer for at least 10 years; and I was determined to change that trend. As tryout approached, I realized that it was going to be a lot more difficult than expected; and unfortunately did not come out successful. Though I did feel a bit defeated at first, I did not let that deter me from pursuing my passion. So this time around with a better understanding of what I needed to do to succeed, I practiced double the amount I did before. The following tryout, I made the line; and proceeded to march the rest of my time in high school as a snare!"

            "Question 9": "My passion for helping others started at my first opportunity to work as a Chick-fil-A team member during my junior and senior years of high school. In pursuing that at a very early age, I gained a spirit of service during my time at Chick-fil-A. As I kept working within the company as a team member, I learned through my professional experience the responsibility of a Chick-fil-A team member is more than serving chicken and fries. I was taught to be a light in the darkness within a community that permeated with evil and despair, which was one of my Chick-fil-A\u2019s core values for our specific community serving the public within the Fort Worth area.\nIn those instances on the job, I encountered a variety of customers with aggressive attitudes. Whenever those specific customers have aggressive attitudes and indignant demeanors, I always recall my purpose as a Chick-fil-A team member: to give hope to the community by being kind and gentle in stressful situations. Those simple decisions to smile and speak enthusiastically with a caring attitude can go a long way to make someone feel seen within their struggles.

            "Question 10": "Attending boarding school has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember; the thought of applying was awe-inspiring. The application process to various schools around the country was a tedious and time-consuming process that required me to push my boundaries and try very hard to find a scholarship that my family could afford for a rigorous and expensive education. I wanted to attend one school in particular; receiving a denial letter was a heartbreaking understatement. Many of my friends even scoffed and gasped at attending such a prestigious school. I was persistent for a better education at boarding school and refused to let obstacles prevent my dreams. In my freshman year of high school, I consisted of working for a future outside my comfort. I stretched my limits to excel in a new environment by writing essays and taking private school admission tests. My dream finally came to fruition; I was matched with Stuart Hall School. All the rest is history, with the fact that I achieved those dreams of getting into a boarding school."

But I\u2019m attempting to incorporate something into this plan that I didn\u2019t receive when I was in high school, which is the act of helping. As I entered the second semester of my freshman year, I realized I have a true passion for helping others. Whether it be a question on how to do partial derivatives in three dimensions or what specific workouts to do in the gym to get stronger, I love hearing from others and solving their questions. I believe I am this way because of my parents. They were the \u201canswer machine\u201d to all the questions I had in my life. As a result, I plan to incorporate this passion and vision into the SEC community. The SEC\u2019s mission of being a representative voice, increasing engineering awareness, and enhancing professional advancement all align with my long-term goals and commitment to the big three values.\nI believe I can implement my passion most efficiently in the Internal Committee.

            "Question 10": "A time when I demonstrated a strong commitment to achieving a goal outside of the classroom was my path toward the sport of tennis. I loved the way the sport was played, the independent feeling, and the non-stop thrill. My 7th-grade self felt incapable of taking on this huge challenge, and my lack of confidence was my biggest roadblock. I was attempting to chase a goal that seemed bigger than myself; therefore, my confidence plummeted to the ground. But I found a solution to get back on my committed path: praying. I began this act after witnessing my father grow mentally and spiritually. After praying continuously, I felt pure and I realized that I have a true purpose in this world to reach any goal I desire. Three years passed by and I was already on my high school varsity team as a sophomore. My lack of confidence truly became my biggest asset. I achieved a goal I never imagined I would, and I now have guidance from the SEC that can prove that roadblocks aren\u2019t setbacks but instead a magnet to success."

As an Eagle Scout, I put in over 300 service hours during my Eagle Project alone. Not including the countless hours I volunteered for HOME (Help Our Military Endure). Additionally, I\u2019ve helped foster a passion for engineering in younger children as well. In 2020, the robotics team I was on hosted multiple webinars to incorporate simple engineering projects into children\u2019s lives at a young age. In one of these webinars, I hosted a segment labeled \u201cSink or Float\u201d to encourage children to use creative thinking skills to guess whether an object will sink or float. After brainstorming on how to keep the children engaged in the webinar presentation, I thought it best to bring out my signature \u201cgame show host voice\u201d and channel my inner Steve Harvey.

            "Question 10": "The following is a story about my Eagle Scout project: I wanted to be an Eagle Scout and decided to lead a project where we would create a pavestone pathway at \u201cThe Longhorn Project,\u201d a place where high school students took care of local longhorns to make the workplace safer, and I experienced many roadblocks working on this project. First, the ground we were trying to level wasn\u2019t made completely of dirt, so we had to use pickaxes to clear out the large gravel. Second, the gas powered tamper wouldn\u2019t tamp the gravel we laid to the right depth, so we had to hand tamper the ground after running the gas powered one. Finally, we ran out of zig-zag recycled bricks, so we had to end the work day early, and buy more at Home Depot to finish the pathway. Nevertheless, I managed to get past each roadblock and find a solution. In the end the pathway was complete and safer than ever. Even though it took over a week and a half of my time, I wouldn\u2019t go back and change a thing. We never gave up in the face of adversity and stayed dedicated through the hardships."

            "Question 8": "The role of the legislation committee in fulfilling the internal pillar of the mission statement by representing engineering students and being their voice speaks to me the most because without the SEC many engineering students would feel unheard. Oftentimes when students have a new idea or suggestion for the college of engineering it can be difficult for them to get in touch with the right people for their ideas to be heard. This can either be due to not knowing who to contact or not getting a response because of the busy schedules of administrators in the college. The SEC gives students the ability to express their opinions on how the college of engineering is operated, which is in my opinion their biggest and most important contribution. I hope to work on ensuring that engineering students feel like they are heard through surveys, polls, and suggestion boxes.",
            "Question 9": "One major goal I have for my career is to be part of a team that takes into consideration the value of the combined ideas of many different people in different roles. I find this kind of environment exciting due to the prospects of what can be accomplished when diverse groups of people can utilize their individual skill sets for the benefit of the group. I see myself as someone who would thrive in a situation where I can assist others in making sure their ideas are heard. Besides being something that I strive for when working in teams, making sure everyone\u2019s ideas are considered facilitates creativity and innovation which are two very important processes in the world of engineering. I also want to emphasize the importance of mentorship in the workplace because while a company can use all its resources towards training veteran employees, if they are not also focused on teaching newer employees and interns then the company will lack in growth and longevity. Many teams in all industries and fields undervalue the diversity in thought that comes specifically from people in different age groups. Those in senior roles with many years of experience are often dismissive of the new ideas presented by their subordinates because of their position. I hope to change this phenomenon in the college of engineering and my future work environment by being a representative voice for everyone, regardless of their position or background.",
            "Question 10": "When planning my Eagle Scout project, many challenges delayed my original plan to build a wooden gaga ball pit to benefit a local school. While the dean of the school expressed interest in working with me, I would often not receive responses from him for weeks after messaging. This went on for a few months with my plans for the build complete, but I was unable to start construction due to the dean neglecting to get permission from the school board. To make his job easier, I took the liberty of drawing up extra diagrams that showed where exactly the footprint of the gaga ball pit would be, and I took pictures of the site for added clarity. Nonetheless, the project deadline was approaching and the dean\u2019s increased unresponsiveness caused me to have to make a last-minute decision to change the beneficiary of the project. I ended up finding a church nearby that was more than happy to have a new gaga ball pit for their children\u2019s ministry. This time communication went smoothly, and I was able to start the project just a few days later which taught me the value of good communication and flexibility."

            "Question 8": "If I could say all three I would, but honestly, the one I feel most aligns with feelings of my own is the mission to increase engineering awareness. When I was in high school (a.k.a. really trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I was older), I only ever knew that engineering was something I wanted to do because of my parents. They both went to school for engineering, so I was exposed to how an engineer thinks and what they do, from an early age. However, no other person, school event, or even high school class really provided the experience and knowledge for engineering. I've thought for a while how there should be more widespread access to learn what engineering really is so that not only will more people want to be an engineer, but so that more people know what major they're a part of.",
            "Question 9": "Ever since I wanted to be an engineer I knew it was for the purpose of making this world a better place. However, me trying to be a part of healing this planet doesn't mean I'm just making a contribution through better technology, it also means just being more compassionate to those around me. Everyone deserves to be represented well no matter the circumstances, professional field or not. I plan to take this mindset with me into professional life, and I know it will come to good use in the Student Engineer's Council. Being a specific kind of engineer doesn't mean I'll just be working with people in my same field of work, but instead I will be collaborating with people from different backgrounds and with different knowledge. No matter who I'm working with, I plan to be open-minded to ideas from everyone, and to truly listen to the voices around me. Although critiques and feedback can be hard to accept sometimes, it's important to have humility in the professional field. Just like this, the SEC is not only full of members studying many different types of engineering, but is also representing all students in the College of Engineering, and we all have concerns or ideas to improve the system that deserve to be heard.",
            "Question 10": "During the Rush process last semester, I heard about these thing called SongFest. I didn't really know what the event entailed, all I knew is that it was dancing which meant I had to participate. Auditions were shortly after being invited to Kappa Alpha Theta, and even though I knew I'd be busy trying to figure out how the life of a freshmen engineer worked, I was determined to be a part of this event. After dancing for 15 years, I didn't realize I'd miss dance until I started rehearsing for SongFest and while it was refreshing getting to finally dance again, I felt overwhelmed by my class load, org applications, church searching, and the list goes on. Despite these stressors, I pushed myself to not feel discouraged but instead take each day one at a time, and the closer we got to the performance, the more confident I felt in my ability to be flexible with my time. SongFest was an incredible experience, and I got more out of it than I thought I would. I gained great friendships and am now officially a SongFest chair for next year! Sometimes you don't realize the goal until you achieve it."

            "Question 8": "The most crucial pillar of the three for me would be increasing engineering awareness. Throughout my academic career, I have noticed that people have a prejudice towards engineering because they think that it is boring since it only involves math and science. While engineering does heavily revolve around math and science, it is definitely not dull. Throughout high school, I did STEM events with schools in my city and internationally. All these events were hosted to engage kids in engineering and show them that it is fun. I showed them that everything they need and use is because of engineers. Because of this, I want to join the SEC to change that mindset. Being in SEC will allow me to increase engineering awareness for everyone.",
            "Question 9": "I plan to incorporate my passion for helping others into my profession and the SEC, creating awareness about issues and how engineering can help solve them. For example, I want to learn how to harness atomic energy for safe use and renewable consumption. By making nuclear power a sustainable energy option, I can improve the lives of many. Giving back to people is what helps us as humanity grow, which is why I want to become a nuclear engineer who works in the energy sector. While my ambition is high, I know that more than one mind is needed to tackle the vastness of nuclear energy. That leads back to creating engineering awareness through discussions and activities, making students aware of energy usage and sustainable energy, and sparking a passion for creating change. I have gained numerous skills, including communication, organization, and adaptability, during my time as outreach head in robotics. These skills that I have learned bleed into the making of a professional leader and engineer. I will be able to combine both the technical skills I will learn and the social skills that I have learned to become an engineer who can give and receive information. Texas A&M will give me a broader audience to inspire and SEC even bigger. As an SEC member, I will be able to communicate with my peers, be a bridge to the professional world, and simultaneously grow with the organization.",
            "Question 10": "During the summer of 2022, I interned with Bhogale Automotives in Aurangabad, India. The owner took me under his wing and made me work a few days in every department, with my main focus being the engineering of making pistons for automobiles. It was a great experience but the biggest obstacle was the language barrier between myself and the workers. During the year leading up to the internship, I would practice every day to ensure that I understood Marathi and was comfortable speaking it. I came up with goals that I needed to achieve by a specific time. First, I learned the basics in the first two months, then I moved into forming basic sentences in the next five months, and the last five months were learning how to converse and hold conversations. When it was time for my internship, I was able to communicate professionally with the employees. This experience helped me learn how to overcome challenges. Starting with my passion, and including my dedication and motivation I will truly be an asset to the Students\u2019 Engineering Council."

The SEC opens up doors to change this perception. Wellness Week, a week to promote mental and physical health, is one of the many ways the SEC reaches out to the engineering students so they do not feel lost in the waves of the motion. This emphasizes one of the three pillars of the SEC Mission Statement, which is to increase engineering awareness through its events and programs. Most think of the Career Fair, DI Saturday, or Industry Night when it comes to the SEC. All of these are important, but most forget about how the SEC helps engineers navigate one of the most challenging times of their lives by supporting their endeavors.",
            "Question 9": "Throughout high school, I was a part of the Health Science endorsement. I fell in love not only with seeing how my actions could help someone else thrive, but also with the technological side of medicine. Ever since I was young, I have found great fulfillment when helping others. In early elementary school, I even made my own first aid kit for the bus stop to treat the other neighborhood kids when they tripped and fell. Because of my passion for helping others, I hope to use my future degree, electrical engineering, to design and improve medical devices so patients can have a better experience inside and outside of the hospital. Because of my love for helping others and improving what I can, I hope to join the SEC to help other engineers feel less alone and lost in their work. Engineering is a tasking, rough degree program that can feel like a beat down, and through events such as Wellness Week, students can hopefully find time to break away from the books to improve their mental and physical health.",
            "Question 10": "The past year was a definite trial of my time management skills and ability to keep my word. From junior to senior year, I went from being an officer in one of the organizations I was in, to all of them. On top of that, I was in three AP sciences and AP Calculus AB. I would find myself with a fully booked schedule through all of my club commitments, band, and homework. At first, I was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know how I was going to balance it all. For all of my organization activities, I spent 2 hours of my day just reviewing all documents for my organizations. That doesn\u2019t include any extra time I chose to put in. I had promised to uphold all expectations of the positions I took in my organizations, but started to feel like I was letting others down. Instead of giving up, I persevered and started to schedule my days to help keep track of everything. With this, I was able to become a better officer to my fellow peers and achieve the most I could."

One of the biggest issues I had in high school was choosing my major, and when I settled on engineering, I didn't know much about it. I knew I loved math and science and that there were many opportunities and paths to take with my major, but that was about it. By working for engineering awareness, I can help others understand what engineering entails and what they can do with it and get them excited to know more. I hope to help with events that support this idea, such as the Envision Conference and Engineers' Week.",
            "Question 9": "Since I have always loved to help others, many of my professional goals are centered around this idea. In the future, my goal is to enter a career where I can do something to make others' lives a little bit easier. I can do this through designing more efficient computer programs, working to build better roads and infrastructure, or creating more durable products. I also hope to help others by working with a team on such projects since it often takes more than one person to do something great. My passion for helping others can contribute to the mission of the SEC through my time and hard work. It may sound like a cliche, stating that my time and hard work will be my contribution, but they are the biggest things I have to offer to this organization. I would put my all into helping with events that spread engineering awareness and do my best to help others in the organization when necessary. In the end, my main goal when applying to SEC is to spread awareness of engineering and help those in our student body know what the Department of Engineering has to offer.",
            "Question 10": "My main goal at the beginning of my first semester of college was to become more involved on campus. While I did clubs and UIL competitions for band, theater, and academics, I didn't feel connected to the people. A roadblocks I had was I was often scared to ask others if they were free to hang out and didn't look for opportunities to get out. I got over this by putting myself out there. After that, I started to look around campus for events and organizations that interested me. To keep myself involved, I decided to go out for a FLO and keep track of all of the events, like football games, Midnight Yells and other org events I wanted experience. By the middle of the semester, I got into my preferred FLO and had so much fun at all of the traditions and activities I have went to. If I did not have the goal to get involved, I likely would not have found out about the wonderful organizations on campus, or had the confidence to put myself out there in the hopes of joining the Student Engineers' Council now."

Enhancing the professional skills of engineering students builds their confidence when speaking to large groups or interviewers at a company they want to work for. This is a skill that all engineering students should possess because it proves that they can be in and handle stressful situations. This pillar resonates with me because it highlights how the Student Engineers' Council wants all engineering students to develop professional skills that will lead to their success. It proves that the SEC\u2019s mission is to advance the talents of engineering students to prepare them for their future.\nI would love to be a coordinator for the career fair because it will give me the opportunity to help others and witness their professional development firsthand.",
            "Question 9": "In one of my past engineering projects, I designed a camera to meet the specific needs of people with limited hand dexterity. Seeing the immense purpose of my work inspired me to create the best product I could. During the brainstorming process, ideas flowed naturally out of my head and into our product. Going through the iterative design process led to a high-quality result that could help people. After this project, I knew I wanted to become an engineer.\nMy passion for helping people is why I am determined to be an engineer. I would love to make a difference in how people live. For a job, I want to design and build technology that makes people's lives better with engineering. I strive to create technology that countries in unfortunate circumstances can use to improve their environment. This goal of mine contributes to the mission of the Students Engineers\u2019 Council because I want other engineering students to understand that engineering is essential to our society. There were times when I felt discouraged in my engineering abilities. Because of this, I wish to be a mentor to all Aggie engineers and help them succeed. It is essential to guide them on a path where they have the resources and help to have a great future, which can happen through SEC. If one Aggie engineer succeeds, all Aggie engineers can follow the same path and have a bright future.",
            "Question 10": "When I lived in Chicago, I attended a school with only thirty people in my grade. I only knew these kids, and they were the only friends I\u2019d ever made. This made me super shy when I moved to a school in Orlando with over a hundred kids in my grade. My roadblock was being extremely nervous to encounter new people. I was scared to talk to people in my class, but the first step to facing my problem was realizing I\u2019d never grow if I never interacted with others. Introducing myself to one person and being introduced to their friends helped me get the courage to meet new people. By being determined and seeking social interactions, I became extroverted.\nMy experience in Orlando helped me effortlessly adapt to a new environment when I moved to Austin, Texas. I didn\u2019t face a roadblock from moving again, and it didn\u2019t stop me from becoming friends with most of the eighth-grade class in Austin. I was nervous before, but talking to new people now comes naturally. The roadblock I faced when I was younger strengthened my confidence to interact with new people and develop my love for talking to others."

I see time and time again friends switching between majors and hoping to land on the right option before they have to ETAM. It is because of my personal experience that increasing engineering awareness resonates the most with me. Personally, I have had similar issues when deciding on a major. When I entered college, I was pretty set on becoming a mechanical engineering major, but that quickly changed to computer science. I attribute this change to attending DI Saturday and working on projects in Aggie Coding Club. Without discovering more information about computer science through programs and events, I would not be in the optimistic position I am in now.",
            "Question 9": "It is through my high school computer science teacher that I was introduced into the world of utilizing technology to create value for others. While being my educator, he ran a large healthcare business that consulted with clinicians and administrative leaders to ensure they\u2019re using the most effective use of technology. Although I do not plan to go into healthcare, I wish to provide the same if not more value to my clients through the use of technology.\nMy previous experience in serving my community will be invaluable during my time in the SEC. Previously, I had served as the Vice President for the Litter Bugs Me Club in high school, where I organized events to feed janitorial staff and teachers on holidays. The staff would even sometimes bring their family and I would love seeing their faces light up eating food and having fun with their loved ones. It was through this experience that led to my lifelong commitment of serving others.\nDuring my time at SEC, I intend to build my foundational skills of serving others to achieve my long-term professional goals. Exposing students and prospective students to the vast opportunities within the College of Engineering is something that I genuinely feel rewarding. Many people are overloaded with information online and the opportunity to actively talk to industry leaders will be a contributing factor in clearing that fog.",

Through spending 10 hour days for 3 days straight, I managed to get the game to a decent working state. However, this project was not without roadblocks.\nI had to rewrite my code twice over, which is especially frustrating when you sink hours into one thing. I also had to express humility, as I often had to ask friends of mine for help when deciding how I should implement certain features. In the end, however, it was a joy to play my game and express how cool they thought it was; the value others get from my creations make the effort worth it. It was through this project that I learned the hard way that progress is not linear, and is in fact a series of ups and downs. But most importantly, I learned that when I put my mind to something I deem valuable, I don\u2019t give up."

I could taste the crisp, salty air as we walked the hectic Brighton streets in Melbourne. When my family returned to visit, we approached the charming Saint Martin\u2019s Cafe and were greeted by an ecstatic owner. An old lady I didn\u2019t recognize, enamored at the first sight of us in years, filled consummately with eagerness to make us feel at home, serving us free pastries. When my parents emigrated from China there, they were capable engineers, but they faced the challenges of navigating new worlds in a foreign country, graciously supported by the lively Brighton community.\nService defines my life, and I want to extend that to the engineering community. Whether through the meticulous relationship building of Corporate Relations, the tremendous program of EnVision, or serving as the representative voice at the faculty dinner, SEC extends a warm embrace to all engineers. As a student in EnMed, I can offer tremendous value, with my service background ensuring that I will never lose sight of what matters most: being the Saint Martin\u2019s Cafe for Aggie Engineers, willing to help engineering students with any need: assisting with professional development, providing a voice, or increasing engineering awareness.",

They had no remorse, and it was insufferable, especially for somebody who utterly despises losing. My bloodshot eyes yearned for a win.\nThe only out was to get better, and I immersed myself into poker books, turning over every stone behind Game Theory Optimal (GTO) and REM. I spent months memorizing strictly tournament pre-flop, then ranges, thin value\u2026 relentlessly determined in a quest for knowledge. However, even when I thought I trapped him in the perfect slot, he always seemed to turn over a winner. Instead of feeling deterred, I only felt more invigorated. As in any craft, new skills and techniques need hours of sharpening and practice behind the scenes before deceptively effortless deployments when it counts.\nThe first time I beat Mr. Bruce in a tournament, I didn\u2019t obnoxiously celebrate. I stoically nodded, before cracking the most slight half smile. This ceaseless and resolute attitude of constantly searching for improvement is one that I carry in all my endeavors, and will certainly bring to any SEC committee."

Seeing the success of others intrinsically makes me happy and motivates me to be of use. I want everyone around me to succeed, and that includes all incoming and current engineering students. Ultimately, I would love to give every engineer the best possible quality of endeavor, and I would be honored to contribute to this goal as a member of the SEC.",
            "Question 9": "I plan on incorporating my passion for helping others by harnessing my experience as a student government treasurer and combining it with my love of engineering into a career as a leader in engineering. Starting in middle school and continuing until my senior year of high school, I served as my student government's treasurer, where I was given the privilege of providing many different services to my school. As a member, I participated in hundreds of hours of community service while planning amazing events like blood drives, rallies, profit shares, and more. Being a treasurer, I handled a $75,000 budget to provide my student government with the funds to be able to help the students on my campus. This experience ultimately opened my eyes to just how satisfying it is to be someone who can help others in the challenges that they go through. I then combined this way of thinking with my professional passion for aerospace engineering, and I decided that I was going to work as hard as I possibly could to be in a managerial position for a company that is dedicated to getting farther into space. This passion will seamlessly translate into the mission statement for the SEC, as I believe I can use my experience with student government and apply it to the events that we run to help engineers across our campus get more involved and have an easier path to make their impact on our world.",
            "Question 10": "Within the first month of college, I immediately demonstrated a strong commitment to a goal outside the classroom by joining a freshman leadership organization. However, the hardships of being a new student and not understanding any of my surroundings were tough, especially being from out-of-state. I had not gone to a fish camp or even understood any of the traditions of being an Aggie, and this left me feeling ostracized in the face of meeting all of these new people who bonded over things I felt were foreign. So I did the only thing I thought possible: I faced the fire straight on. I turned my anxiety over what to say in conversation into curiosity, which allowed me to perform better and be seen as not weird but unique. I truly put in the effort it took because I knew that these were people I wanted to see succeed in the future. In the SEC, there will always be challenges, like spending sleepless nights planning for the Career Fair only for some companies to provide unforeseen hurdles. Nevertheless, truly overcoming a challenge for the sole goal of lifting others up is why I am so interested in the SEC."

I transferred here last semester, and originally started my college experience at Texas State. I was undecided going into college, never even thinking about how engineering could be the right fit for me. I deemed engineering only for people who were natural born geniuses. About a year into my college journey I convinced myself that I could pursue engineering, I just had to put in the work for it. I am the first generation in my family to earn a college degree and I want to prove to others (especially the younger generation) that if I could do it, they can too.",
            "Question 9": "I have a passion for helping others. I have been a nanny for years and have a lot of experience with children. I had a part in teaching them to read and write. I will always be young at heart, and any opportunities to inspire the younger generation would be extremely rewarding for me. I also enjoy volunteering, and would love any extra experiences this organization could give me to improve my overall career skills. Over the years, I have volunteered and been a class counselor for many vacation bible schools through different churches. I also volunteered every Wednesday and Sunday in a church nursery throughout high school, for church services and bible study groups.\nI am passionate about improving the on going issue of global warming and air pollution. My dream is to work in the automotive industry, and the air pollution caused my greenhouse gas emissions from gas powered vehicles is a major issue. By being in this industry I can promise as an aggie that I will always account for ethics over any kind of personal gain.\nI think my values contribute to the Student Engineers' Council, because I have a passion for helping people in all ways. Directly, by volunteering in any way to inspire others like me to pursue engineering. Indirectly, by committing myself to helping out with things behind the scenes, as well as after I graduate by committing myself to helping this beautiful world we live on.",
            "Question 10": "When I was a student at Texas State before I transferred, I was a part of their Formula SAE team. Their team was no were near as experienced as ours, and there were many roadblocks in building our car because of that. Many new people joined the year I did, so there was a huge learning curve for all of us, which was a good and a bad thing. It was a bad thing because, unfortunately there were not enough experienced people on the team so we were not able to get our car up to competition standards in time for the race. I think it was mostly a beneficial thing, because it gave me a no pressure zone to learn things that I hadn\u2019t known about before. I learned to weld, 3D print, as well as learn more about Formula SAE competition standards. Those background experiences now aid me by giving me a bit of prior knowledge in engineering."

I first made a resume when I was twelve with the help of my mom. Later, I found it engaging to see how one piece of paper can affect someone's career so strongly. I have even edited resumes for my family and friends because I found it satisfying when it was complete. I would bring this attitude and ambition to the SEC. For example, I could help engineering students who are preparing for the career fair. It would be fun to share what I have learned while also learning from others at the same time. There is always an opportunity to grow professionally, and I enjoy creating new ways to improve my future profession.",
            "Question 9": "While I know that I want to become a chemical engineer, I am still wavering between several specific areas of interest for my future including: oil and gas, medical equipment design, and research on medication/other chemicals. Despite this, I intend to make sure my results are a benefit to society. For example, if I choose to go into medication research, I want to be extremely thorough and ensure the medication's success. I am passionate about this topic because my family has been very familiar with cancer since 2020 when my mother was diagnosed. I love the thought of working in Houston's medical district where I could help and encourage other families who went through a similar experience. Another example would be in the oil and gas industry; I plan to use my knowledge to bring awareness to the areas that are potentially hazardous as well as building up other areas to keep the economy up. Applying this to the SEC is simple. I am flexible with my destination; however, I will work just as hard for every path that I aim towards. As a graduate with an engineering degree, I can be a resource for engineering students who are unsure of their path, looking for work, or potentially represent my future company by attending a career fair.",
            "Question 10": "Before I began my first semester at Texas A&M, I was an intern for my city's engineering department. Naturally, I did not know how to work multiple civil engineering software programs that they asked us to use. My boss gave all of the interns a seven-hour crash course for AutoCAD. My roadblock was my lack of knowledge. I worked on these programs for eight hours every week day. I would run into problems and have to research the answer by the internet or advice from other engineers. Often times, my boss would give me a large stack of papers of old projects which I analyzed and referenced for hours. It was a humbling experience. I forged through it until I would come to a breakthrough. Little by little, I retained the information with notes and bookmarks on my chrome browser. By the end of the internship, I not only figured out how the programs worked, but successfully finished two projects that were signed off on. In a few months, my character had grown significantly. I want to do the same thing in SEC: I learn from my piers while sharing my insight as well."

I would find myself trapped in a merry-go-round of attending class and submitting assignments. This worked for a while, but if I had continued on this path, I would not have been prepared to enter the professional world. The SEC changed this for me. After a few email reminders about summits and the Career Fair, I applied for an internship earlier, bought professional clothes, and started making connections with people I could count on later in life. Now, given the chance, I want to have the same effect on others that SEC had on me; to inspire all engineers with a passion to advance and succeed in their professional and personal lives.",
            "Question 9": "As of this moment and for many years prior, my primary professional goal in life is to become the head neurosurgeon of my own clinic and design devices to aid me in my procedures. Additionally, I would love to share the knowledge I possess with those who are receptive, and I wish to continue this later in my professional life by volunteering at universities to teach and de-mystify issues in the neurological field to aspiring engineers. The professional advancement of engineers is something I care deeply about, so not only will I teach but I will also provide them with contacts and shadowing opportunities. By running a clinic, I can provide an on-the-ground experience and networking opportunity that will create solid foundations and skills for any engineer looking to advance into the professional world. When I shadowed a surgeon in Pennsylvania it opened up a lot of opportunities and provided me with skills I can use both in and out of the classroom. Giving the same opportunity to future engineers is one of the best ways I believe I can advance their development into the professional world.",
            "Question 10": "During the summer before college, I worked at a solar company called Freedom Solar, and my job was to review and approve contracts submitted by sales representatives. When I first joined, the company had a backlog of over 700 contracts with new contracts being added daily. I made it my goal to bring that to zero by the end of the summer. Many contracts were incorrect which slowed down progress towards my goal. Out of frustration, I made a spreadsheet to keep track of the sales representatives who submitted contracts. Eventually, trends began to emerge with specific representatives consistently forgetting material. I brought this up to the sales manager, and soon the contracts had significantly fewer errors and the process became more efficient. This gradual but noticeable improvement was what kept me focused and dedicated to my goal. I was able to see that not only was I helping myself to complete my goal, but I was also helping whoever came after me as the sales representatives would be more knowledgeable. By breaking the monotony of reviewing contracts and going the extra mile I was able to stay focused and dedicated towards my goal."

However, the pillar of professional development stands out the most to me personally. Engineering students tend to be an ambitious group that aims to solve problems that plague our society with critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Texas A&M is the perfect place to foster a mindset for how students should not only conduct tasks in the workforce, but also cooperate and collaborate with a team. Texas A&M should utilize their resources in the best interest of students by also teaching communication skills and professional skills that are relevant in the real world. With these traits developed, Aggies can go out and pursue their ambitions and dreams as they desire.",
            "Question 9": "From my point of view, the SEC is a very goal-oriented organization that ensures that engineering students are making the most of what Texas A&M can offer through engineering courses, networking, and job prospects. More so, this is an organization that focuses on reaching out to students and helping them navigate their paths through college where students can make the right and informed decisions so they can feel comfortable with their future. The motive for helping others will be relevant in the future with my long-term professional goals because I intend to use both my undergraduate engineering degree and my MBA to stand out to my employers for a corporate level position in Texas Instruments (TI). I see a place for myself on the sales side of TI where I will sell medical equipment to various companies and hospitals that will benefit various patients in the future. The advancement of medical instruments as well as its widespread use only serves to benefit society and reach out to various people of different backgrounds, even those who may not always be able to afford the medical bill. This will contribute to the mission of the SEC because throughout my time in the SEC I want to create awareness and reach out to students who may be lost or confused on what they are supposed to do when finding or utilizing the resources to maximize their chances at landing an internship and potentially their careers after graduation.",
            "Question 10": "Volunteering at the Houston Food Bank built character within me because this experience taught me about the importance of reaching out and blessing other people in whatever capacity. However, it was not always a smooth operation because for two years within the Food Bank Infrastructure, there was a lot of change and adjustment around Covid-19 when families needed our efforts the most. Covid 19 presented a myriad of challenges for the team. There was a massive shortage of manpower to inspect and box food items. This problem tested our collaboration skills because the warehouse team had to learn to adjust as did I. As a team, we had to be diligent in making sure food items were sorted into the right boxes with less assistance. In order to carry out the demand for food items, we learned to communicate and be in sync with one another to deliver food. We overcame these roadblocks with diligence and communication to hit the goal of feeding over 3000 families together when demand for food was at an all-time high. This experience was important because it taught me not to be deterred by obstacles that could prevent us from reaching out to people."

I was afraid that my choice of engineering had locked me into a future I knew nothing about. But through Industry Nights and DI Saturdays, I gained a new level of awareness, seeing past the present and into what the future might entail in the discipline of engineering. My heightened awareness brought a sense of security, one that I wish to bring to incoming freshmen who shared my concerns. Only through exposure can students understand, and I hope to bring that exposure to them.",
            "Question 9": "The goal of every engineer, more than to solve a problem, is to help others. A problem that doesn\u2019t inhibit people isn\u2019t a problem at all. I realized this when I discovered the TranscribeGlass, glasses that create captions in real time of people talking for deaf users to read. More than the concept itself, I was fascinated by the problem, one that I had never considered. The problems of disabled people had never crossed my mind.\nThis concept stuck with me, and I joined a research team for creating tactile imagery for blind people because of it. As I have progressed in this research I have found my passion. Engineering solutions towards real-life problems for disabled people struck a nerve within me.\nWithin the SEC, I aim to increase the reach of the representative voice, spreading it beyond just students without disabilities. The mission of the SEC is to be the representative voice of all engineering students, and I aim to do just that. Through special conferences and workshops dedicated to working with disabilities, we could give these students a chance to feel represented within the student engineering body, as well as offer professional advancement opportunities beyond their college career.",

However, all fundraisers had been halted to comply with social distancing guidelines.\nIn order to work around this, I first tried to raise money online. However, it became clear that people were less inclined to donate when a problem was on screens instead of their faces. The posts were not gaining enough traction or raising enough money.\nI was ready to tap out, tired of the countless setbacks I had faced. Yet I was reminded that I had the privilege of giving up. My friend, and the others like him had to live with the reality they were dealt, whereas I could choose to quit.\nWith this thought in mind, I found another approach, organizing a charity fun run. With the 50 participants that I brought in, I was able to raise over $1000 for free school lunches."

Students' ability to succeed in the corporate world depends on how well they can represent themselves and connect with employers. Students might initially be anxious or have difficulty selling themselves to employers. Still, the SEC's career fairs and resume workshops allow students to develop themselves to pursue their dream jobs. This resonates with me as I want to assist in building students' careers.",
            "Question 9": "I\u2019ve always helped and was willing to help my peers in whatever predicament they might have faced. Whether it was an issue with homework, projects, or even the unit itself, I was always ready to give a helping hand. However, that was only because I was once the individual who needed help. I remember feeling lost and confused over the material or even aspects of life. Frequently, I experience roadblocks or obstacles I perceive as impossible to push through, and I stop right in my tracks, unsure of what to do. It's through times like these that I depend on those around me. Thankfully, I've had several mentors who aided me in my time of need and helped me find the solutions. It's because I've been lost and confused that I want to help others; I know how unsettling and frustrating it can be. So whenever I see someone in need, I try to assist them however I can. Ultimately, I want to positively impact as many people as possible and create an environment where we can all succeed together. This is where I believe I align with SEC, as its core focus is to uplift the engineering body. As an engineering peer teacher, I've encountered several freshmen who are lost and unsure of how to go about their time in college. Through the SEC, I plan on creating an environment that bridges the gap of incoming freshmen upper classmen, enabling a more collaborative and helpful experience.",
            "Question 10": "A commitment that I am still facing is the pursuit of my dream. For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to be a computer scientist, from watching YouTube tutorials to creating clubs in high school to spread technology awareness to young teens. However, during my pursuit, I faced several challenges during my senior year of high school; despite being in the top 3%, I got rejected from several colleges for computer science programming, resulting in my enrollment in Texas A&M. Eager to be in a university, I over dreamed of what was capable of me and took on a bigger course load then I was ready for as a freshman. This resulted in me not ETAMing my freshman year; however, I didn't let that stop me, and I continued to pursue my dream. Going into my sophomore year, I knew I had to go about things differently. I dialed it back on my courseload and focused on my quality of life. I joined social organizations that allowed me to develop as a person and continue to reach out to companies and professors for experience. Resulting in my close relations to professor leading to potential research opportunities this summer"

Increasing engineering awareness through opportunities and events is the pillar that resonates with me the most because it allows experienced individuals to share their knowledge with the younger generation, leading them to get invested in engineering at a younger age and capture the interest of those who hadn\u2019t considered engineering as a career path. It is of interest to share my experience with those who are still deciding about which career path to take and to incentivize people to follow the STEM path.",
            "Question 9": "As a former camp counselor and student, it has always been my passion to create beautiful experiences for others and help them whenever they\u2019re in need. Engineering has been one of my greatest passions for a long time. I plan to use my knowledge and experience to advance any industry I pursue and share my experiences with students lost in the engineering world. As a future professional engineer, I strive to serve the aerospace industry, an industry that I believe provides highly beneficial technology for society. Yet, I think there is more to my career than simply conforming to private work.

            "Question 10": "Shyness and anxiety are the biggest challenges that some individuals must overcome to reach their maximum potential. As a shy individual, I always struggled to get out of my comfort zone and get involved in activities beyond the classroom. Yet, one day, I was given the opportunity to become a camp counselor, an individual known for their outgoing personality and the beautiful experiences they provide to others. While the description of this position was polar opposite to who I was, I challenged myself to get this job. I underwent multiple experiences that required me to get out of my shell. Creating games with others, dancing, shouting, and constantly interacting with strangers were all activities I had to do during my application. While the process was difficult, my desire to overcome my weaknesses and become the confident person I desired to be pushed me forward, eventually landing me in the position. After many years of being involved with the camp, I can see that this effort was worth it, and it made me understand that I\u2019m capable of overcoming difficulties and thriving."

I had heard that this school provides many opportunities for freshmen and helps them succeed as engineers in the future. During the first week of class, I found out about many different organizations and events that would occur to help freshmen during their first semester pre-ETAM.\nAll these events that SEC does and is a main pillar of SEC are the reasons why I have benefited so much from my freshman year and learned about many new opportunities to help me be successful in the future. I would love to be a part of an organization that allows me to do the same for incoming freshmen.",
            "Question 9": "One way I plan on helping others in the rest of my career is being someone that people can come talk to. I am planning on doing pre-med along with Chemical Engineering, which will allow me to have both aspects when working with problem-solving but also being a person that people can trust and talk to. This may seem like a small thing in terms of being helpful. However, I believe that everyone needs someone to talk to and have a person they can trust. I have had some experiences where a stranger has just been there for me or even encouraged me into believing I can do something. I have had so many of these experiences, and they have boosted my confidence, which is why I want to be that person for other people.\nNow, how can I apply this to SEC when working with many freshmen events like industry night or career fair? I want to be an encouraging person for freshmen that have never done or been to events like these. I want to be a person that can help others and be there for them when they think they have no one. This could be in ways such as just saying good luck to someone when entering the career fair or approaching someone that seems stressed at an event and giving them encouragement to assist them in getting through it.",
            "Question 10": "My senior year of high school, I served as the President of the National English Honor Society and as the Swim Captain. I was passionate and committed to both of these positions. I spent a lot of time preparing slides for club meetings and organizing swim events for the team to foster a stronger connection.\nI had to put in a significant effort to ensure people would have the same experience, if not a better one. I was in charge of organizing all the events for people to be involved in, spending many hours outside of school to ensure people would have an amazing experience in these organizations. This experience relates to SEC and how they put in a lot of work to ensure an easy transition for students here at Texas A&M and help them have the best experience in engineering.\nHowever, some problems I faced included not having other members of the committee who were as passionate and did not fulfill their roles as leaders for the organizations. This meant I had to step in and continue to do more work to ensure that the members of the organizations were not affected by issues with the council."

            "Question 9": "When I was in high school, I used to tutor and worked at a tutoring facility, Kumon, for over a year. I like to mentor and guide people from a beginning point to being able to reach their final goal, because I think everyone is owed the opportunity to succeed. I also served on a volunteer organization called National Charity Roundtable from seventh grade all the way through when I graduated. We volunteered at different places and events throughout each year such as the 4th of July Parade, Meals on Wheels, and at elderly homes playing bingo with the residents. It was nice to get to talk to see them because they always seemed so excited to get to see us, and I loved getting to spend time with them while also getting to know some of them. I also like to do ministry work, and did a mission trip in Beaumont a few years ago where I helped build an elderly lady a wheelchair ramp.

            "Question 10": "This past summer was my last eligible year of swimming on my local summer league swim team I had swam on for 13 years with all of my friends. Since it was our last summer, we wanted to beat the record times for the 15-18 mens freestyle and medley relays. This task was going to require all four of us, and push us to the limit. We decided we were going to go to as many practices as we could, and work as hard as possible at those practices to give ourselves the best shot to achieve our goal. Hours of long, demanding practices followed that pact, then meet after meet where we continued to fall short. With our last meet came much anxiety and pressure on all of us. I was going last in our relay so that meant that it was going to be decided by me. When it came down to it, I put everything I had into that last 50 of our first relay and we ended up beating the record by 4 seconds. All of the work we had put into this season paid off as we ended up breaking both records by multiple seconds."

            "Question 8": "I believe that fostering professional advancement in engineering students resonates with me the most. Engineering is a difficult discipline to go into, so the class requirements alone are a full time commitment. This can lead to other aspects of each student, including myself, not being as developed. That is why there is so much value in helping engineering students to develop professional skills as well as their academic ones. That is one aspect I still have a lot to work on and hope that being a part of the SEC can lead to not only my development, but the development of other students through the committee and activities.",
            "Question 9": "My long term professional goal is to become a physician. The desire to help people is innate to the profession, and I am no exception. The reason I want to become a doctor started with my third grade teacher getting diagnosed with breast cancer during the school year. It was the first time that something like this hit close to home. She was able to beat it and make a recovery, and it inspired me, as I wanted to help people do the same thing. Becoming a doctor however is not that simple and is a multifaceted role that needs experience in many different areas. One aspect is to gain experience in interpersonal interactions. The SEC is the perfect place to start gaining experience meeting new people and working with them to achieve a common goal, which would be reflected in future professional roles as a physician. The SEC strives to help engineering students both do well in their classes and professionally develop into future engineers. Working to achieve a common goal is exactly what becoming a doctor requires with patients, in that both parties are doing their best to solve a problem and get to a common target for the betterment of the patient.",

Advancing through other ranks gave me experience and progress I needed, but there was still the final goal of getting Eagle Scout. The biggest challenge would be the Eagle Scout project, in which you are tasked with finding a suitable project, planning it out, coordinating volunteers and executing the plan. My plan was to do a project for my local elementary school, and the principal had a few ideas. However, the planning process was by far the biggest roadblock faced due to the level of detail needed. An entire step by step procedure was needed so that if you were not there, the project could still be completed, and your role was just to clarify and manage volunteers to complete the project. It took more than a month of planning to be approved by the troop leadership. There were times that I thought about stopping, but what made me keep going was a desire to have something I did impact my community for the better."

As a computer engineering major I would love to help other students make a difference by contributing to the major projects that Systems Administration takes part in. Currently I've been delving into doing a lot more academic projects on my own time, but my projects don't have much of a positive impact on the people around me as I would like. However, I plan to use the knowledge I gain from my projects to aid the SEC in promoting the professional growth of engineering students. I hope to build a project for the SEC that could aid students in gathering the information necessary for more hands-on experience in their respective fields. I know a lot of people who want to get started on developing their own tools, but get overwhelmed by where to start. If there were a platform for students of similar majors to interact one on one, people would not only become much more knowledgeable about the topics of their interests, but this would also lead to the strengthening of the Aggie network. With a stronger engineering network, a stronger representative voice from the SEC could emerge, leading to increased engineering awareness.

At this point we were about to give up when my friend had the bright idea to go to the Texas A&M basketball game as a break. Surprisingly, it worked. It was amazing how we were able to hold each other accountable throughout this stressful event. As a result we stayed up the whole night working on our project through a brand new approach. We were able to get assistance from IEEE mentors who taught us a lot of valuable information. I was proud of my resilience and felt great because I was learned so much.

I always have valued passion over skill, and my passion was to make visible, positive change. So although everyone around me advised me against engineering, I continued on.\nSomething I seemed to understand from the start, was that engineering is not about being good at math- it is about solving problems. It is transformative, opening doors for every sector of the world. It is crucial that minds, young and old are informed about what engineering is. The engineering awareness pillar most resonates with me, because a society that understands and supports engineers is a more efficient society.",

All too many times, we see complacency in upper levels of systems, effectively restricting advancement. A huge goal of mine is to avoid this, and to be constantly changing and seeking new advancements.\nI also believe that to be a good engineer, a vital part of your long term goals must involve seeking out projects with a significant potential for social impact. Whether it be developing more efficient roads or cities, contributing towards healthcare, or finding better ways to set up businesses, contributing positively towards society is the key factor to a successful engineer.\nBy seeking social impact and staying adaptable, I hope to achieve my professional goals.

I threw myself into it, making calls and setting everything up for my original idea- until our second budget meeting. Unexpectedly, my budget was cut by more than half. I was forced to completely scrap the idea I had already set into motion, and start from scratch. Adaptability was key in this situation, and luckily I was able to recognize that and move on.\nI continued drawing up the plans throughout the semester, and coordinating the new ideas. Eventually, it was the day of. I had everything set up in the banquet hall, and as I went to start the projector, everything went blank. In the end, we lost our speakers, but we got the projector back up.\nThrough this experience, I learned how to be flexible with frustrating situations, and despite not being seamless, the event was successful nonetheless."

Incorporating this passion into my long-term professional goals is something that I hope to begin implementing as I progress through my engineering career. As a mechanical engineer, I would be presented with a wonderful opportunity to capitalize on the skills I learn by giving back to others with the work that I do. For example, my brother currently has diabetes and relies on an insulin delivery device in order to monitor his blood sugar and inject insulin whenever necessary. Unfortunately this disease is incurable, but this doesn\u2019t mean that I wouldn\u2019t be able to help my brother. Through the use of computer aided design, I could work on the design for an insulin delivery device that would be more convenient, efficient, and comfortable for him. If the design that I made proved to be effective, then I would not only be able to help my brother but help thousands of others with his condition by mass producing my insulin delivery device. Additionally, I would hope to make the device as affordable and accessible as possible so that anyone who needs the life saving technology could use it.

Ever since I could remember, Computer Science has been the only career path I knew, engaging in competitions, camps, and various projects. It wasn't until attending my first DI Saturday where I was introduced to a major that integrated mechanical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science. My admiration for the nuanced nature of Mechatronics shifted my academic pursuits instantly, and SEC served as a driving force for this pivotal period in my life. Inspired by my own transformative experience, I am inspired to pay it forward by reciprocating my cathartic experiences for the next generation.",

With regards to my career in Mechatronics, I hope to achieve my goals by contributing to the creation of safe intelligent vehicles, creating a safer, better environment for those around me. Eventually, the best way to share my passion for helping each other is by accomplishing my dream of being a professor. The direct impact a professor has is the best way to share my knowledge for students to influence others. As part of the legislation group, the engineering development committee will help me further intentions. I bring a unique perspective to the Industry Night and DI Saturday atmosphere; as someone who has been influenced heavily by both of these events, I am passionate about giving people the best experience possible. As a freshman myself, I witnessed many students forcing themselves to attend due to it being mandatory. However, I bring the idea of involving engineers positively impacted by the content of DI Saturday to highlight its importance and impact before scheduled.

            "Question 10": "I\u2019ve never been one to back down from a challenge, so the prospect of running a 10k through my local temple was certainly an opportunity I could not refuse. Without any thought, I signed up and immediately put it on the back burner as I prioritized the demands of school. With only two weeks remaining until the race and no preparation, it spurred me into action. Due to my lack of experience in long-distance running, I was fatigued and in pain within the first couple miles. In order to build stamina, I had to run consistently which means balancing the hardest part of the school year and training for the 10k. Therefore, I made a schedule focusing on schoolwork for few hours then training during the evenings. This taught me the importance of managing my time. Achieving these goals didn\u2019t just happen during training, but in the kitchen as well. My habits changed revolving around dietary changes. It was a commitment revolving around discipline and time management. Through perseverance, not only did I prepare myself for the race, but I developed a healthier lifestyle. As a member of SEC, I will empower engineers to navigate their own race."

This aligns with what I hope to eventually do in SEC: to represent fellow engineers while also implementing my technical skills in SEC projects related to coding. Throughout my years of involvement, I hope to learn from others how I can best contribute and improve both the representative and outreach aspects that Systems Administration entails.",
            "Question 9": "While I am an engineering major hoping to ETAM into computer science, I am also on the pre-med track. With the task of saving lives and improving quality of life, one of medicine\u2019s fundamental values is to help others. Throughout my academic and professional career, I intend to keep this value at heart. I want to pay attention to detail not only to my work but to others as well. I want to put 100% effort into providing good healthcare, while also building meaningful connections with my colleagues and patients by taking the time to learn about them. To me, helping others is more than just getting my job done, but striving to be someone that others can lean on and turn to for medical or non-medical advice. I hope that I will be a source of inspiration and support to colleagues and patients alike.\nAlthough my impact in SEC will be slightly different than that of a doctor\u2019s, I believe my involvement will provide me with valuable skills for the long run. For example, as I work in groups to complete a coding project in Systems Administration, I will get the chance to meet and learn from many types of people. I\u2019ll learn how to adapt to different dynamics of teamwork, where communication will always be at the forefront. While this is a chance to further my coding skills, I look forward to a supportive group of driven engineers, and hope to pay that forward to the community.",
            "Question 10": "It\u2019s a point of satisfaction for me to persevere through a challenge. But I failed to realize that past challenges were within my capabilities; I had a false sense of security. My ultimate challenge was my summer internship before my senior year.\nThe day consisted of shadowing the cardiac electrophysiologist. After a couple of minutes of following him and scribbling down concepts to search up later, I realized I knew nothing. After eight hours, I realized I had encountered a challenge utterly out of my comfort zone. To say I was overwhelmed would be an understatement. I was surrounded by dedicated professionals, making me feel like my achievements meant nothing. I was an impostor: Based on what I had seen, how could I survive college and graduate school, much less the real world, if this was what being an adult was truly like?\nI realized I was standing at a crossroads: I could continue to despair, or I could grow. I chose the latter. I spent hours each evening researching fundamental aspects of cardiology and electrophysiology. I began to connect the dots as I gained learned more regarding the specialty and medical practice."

This pillar aligns with my belief in active engagement within a student body. At every step of my journey, from early in high school to my 4th semester at Texas A&M, I have looked to play my role in student advocacy. The chance to facilitate a dialogue for my peers is an inspiring task, and I hope to use this to bring about positive changes throughout the School of Engineering. Being the voice of engineering students in the university is nothing short of a privilege, presenting an opportunity to serve a legacy of student-led innovation.",
            "Question 9": "As a sophomore who had to go through the processes that an engineering student at TAMU faces, I have been at the receiving end of valuable guidance from a wide array of sources. I believe that I would not be in the spot I am in today if it was not for the assistance of my peers and mentors. As a member of the SEC, it is my responsibility to pay it forward. My approach to integrating a passion for helping others into my career, both within and beyond the confines of college, begins with fostering engagement and mentorship. Apart from the legislative group within the council, specific cohorts within the event planning committees align with my goals. It was Industry Night of Fall 2022 that allowed me to scope into the field of software engineering. As a directionless 1st semester student, attending the industry night events and DI events helped me connect with members of the organization and like-minded peers. My experiences with SEC\u2019s events let me craft a path for my own professional goals. Working on events such as DI Saturday and Industry Nights, I hope to help introduce younger engineers into developing their professional and academic goals. Coupling this with a strong mentorship system allows students to explore their potential in every realm of engineering. My goal as a member of the SEC is to channel my experiences into guiding emerging engineers in the school.",
            "Question 10": "7 weeks into my internship at Dell Technologies, my group of 3 and I were on track to meet our deliverable, or so we thought. A meeting with leadership revealed that our project had deviated due to miscommunication amongst the group and the leads Although our project was functional without major errors at the time, it did not meet the purpose of the overarching infrastructure. With 5 weeks left, the possibility of us redirecting the course and completing the initially expected product was slim, but not impossible. To get back on track, we established clear communication channels and a structure for accountability. Developing the new code was far from the biggest roadblock we faced, but there was a myriad of other issues to focus on. Creating biweekly check-ins within the group, apart from that with leadership, allowed us to ensure we were on track with every facet of the program. Considering the tight timeline, it was important to divide the coding tasks in an efficient manner. The stakes were realistically not high as we were summer interns, however, the group valued the project with utmost importance, which helped us be consistent with our deliverable."

It emphasizes the importance of advocacy and inclusivity inside the school of engineering. In my personal life, being a representative for the students aligns with my values of helping and giving back to society and being a team member willing to lend a hand. It allows the students to be heard and valued and to seek assistance from a representative when needed, and I am eager to be that person. Being a trusted representative means they must be communicative and trustworthy to have that position, and I pride myself on having both qualities.",
            "Question 9": "One of my long-term values incorporates helping others and giving back to the community, whether the general population or engineering students. As a pre-medicine and engineering student, I actively participate in multiple activities, such as mentoring new Basic Life Support students in the Texas A&M Emergency Care Team organization, which will help save potential lives. My vision is to contribute to the growth and development of future and current engineering students and provide a collaborative environment for students to request help and mentorship. I plan to be involved in outreach where I can engage with the community of student engineers and prospective engineering students. As a prospective representative in the Student Engineering Council, I will promote team-building, leadership, passion, and professional development within the council and among the engineering students. I believe that the sharing of ideas, resources, and experiences can be supportive for the students as well. By doing this, I can create a positive impact and provide the assistance an engineering student needs. These ideas tie back into my values of assisting people while gaining experience in consultation, which is vital in the medical and engineering field. I plan to further improve my communication and leadership skills by applying for the Student Engineering Council, which will help me achieve my current and long-term goals.",
            "Question 10": "In the fall of 2023, I worked towards achieving my Emergency Medical Technician (EMT-B) certification and completed over 150 hours of clinical work, which included real-time emergency responses. During that time, I was a full-time A&M student while doing hours of EMT services and recovering from a torn ACL. I unfortunately lost my mother suddenly due to ovarian cancer in the Spring of 2023 and had to drop out of most of my at-the-time classes, which I retook over the Summer. I struggled immensely; sometimes, I thought I could not complete my EMT certification or classes. With the commitment to achieving my goals, I overcame these obstacles with my mother's unconditional support before she passed. Hence, these experiences taught me to be resilient and meticulously manage my time. The importance of completing my certification reinforced my values of being in engineering and pre-medicine. It proves that even if I face complex challenges, I will overcome them within time."

            "Question 8": "The pillar that most resonates with me is working to increase engineering awareness through programs and events. I believe it is essential to provide networking for all students, including those who are and are not engineering students. This allows students to spread their vast knowledge outside of the tight knit community that is engineering. I believe engineers get put in a bubble-like area that\u2019s excluded from the rest of the campus. I think that students with different majors don\u2019t fully understand the importance of the work of engineers, or quite understand what exactly it is that we do. Thus, providing opportunities such as those that involve communication, creates a sense of community amongst the student body, allowing the flow of ideas.",
            "Question 9": "I plan to incorporate my passion for helping others into my future professional career through the act of networking with others. I believe it is crucial to get involved with as many different organizations as possible in order to increase social awareness and be able to assist as many individuals as possible. Everyone knows that engineering is a team sport, thus, the more people one is in contact with, the more likely they are to succeed in helping others. This can be related back to the mission of the Student Engineers' Council through the goal of fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students within the College of Engineering. Gaining experience is one of the most important aspects when starting to look for a job, and I want to be as involved as I can with other students, like me, in order to work together to make our dreams a reality. We are all trying to get started in the professional world and by working together, it is easier to find those who may present opportunities for you and vice versa. Overall, networking is truly the key to success, and I believe that through communication, I can insert opportunities that help both myself and others.",
            "Question 10": "Looking back at my first semester at college, one of the most challenging, yet rewarding processes I had to face would be sorority recruitment. Now I know you must be thinking how silly it is that I consider putting on my best face and talking to others to be a challenge, but joining a community such as one like that is so important when defining the rest of your college career and future life. Sorority rush has more to it than what meets the eye. There were a plethora of obstacles to face before even talking to the girls. In preparation for this, I had to use my networking skills to reach out to individuals and obtain recommendation letters, as well as completing a thorough application when applying, and so on. It was my personal goal to present myself as best as I could, so I could be perceived in the highest of ways by the sororities, much like getting a job. What helped me stay focused throughout this process was knowing that in the end, I would feel a sense of accomplishment, knowing I did everything in my power to get to the palace I envisioned myself in."

Texas A&M Engineering is a resource-rich department with ample opportunities for its students. Part of being a complete Engineering student is buying into this sea of opportunities and taking advantage of what is provided. Whether it be career fairs and resume workshops or stress-relief events before finals, the Engineering department provides resources intended to aid its students excel. I want to work towards helping realize these benefits for my classmates and peers. As someone that has first-hand experienced the benefits of programs like career fairs, it means a lot to me to raise awareness for the engineering related events offered. When increasingly more Engineering students buy into the opportunities provided, it strengthens the grit and passion of the Engineering department as a whole and creates an environment conducive to academic and personal growth.",
            "Question 9": "Since a relatively young age, I\u2019ve wanted to own a business. I don\u2019t know at what stage of my life I will get there but I do know that incorporating a passion for helping others is an integral part of the process. Career advancement is a multi faceted process but I believe carrying a general passion for helping others will go a long way. While an employer will certainly appreciate you supporting your coworkers, helping others can be fulfilling on a personal level. This is more important because you will carry this implicit desire to help others throughout your life. In the context of someday owning a business, this is especially important. I will constantly strive to elevate those around me, raise awareness for opportunities and potential advancements, and make sure none of my peers fall behind with their goals and aspirations. Being a part of the Student Engineers\u2019 Council will be a stepping stone for what I aspire to be in the real world. Having the inclination to constantly be helping others and working for my peers will manifest in the form of working towards the three pillars of the SEC. Be it through integrity or consciously doing it, helping others will give me purpose as to why and how I want to reach my professional goals.",
            "Question 10": "This past semester I joined a club on campus called 180 Degrees Consulting. Within the organization I participated in a semester-long pro-bono consulting project. I worked in a multidisciplinary team with other members. Our assignment was to help a non-profit organization with their fundraising campaign. We were to conduct market research and devise ways to help the organization reach their financial goals. Knowing I was contributing to an organization committed to a good cause was extremely rewarding, but it came with its fair share of roadblocks. First, working in a team of busy students wasn\u2019t easy. It was often difficult to agree on meeting times given the nature of our schedules. However, we met at times that worked for the majority of us, while filling in the absent members on what they had missed. Finally, because our project required a lot of creative thinking and new ideas, and given how smart our team was, a lot of good ideas were produced with room to only implement a couple of them. It took compromising and creatively combining our thoughts to move forward. We successfully completed the project and I had realized what a good learning opportunity this had been."

This mission that SEC has set out to accomplish is a goal that deeply resonates with me. When choosing where to study, Texas A&M's renowned engineering program and its massive network stuck out. I am passionate about advancing my career, even as a Freshman I began expanding my network by joining a fraternity, going out for a men's org, and applying and joining the STEM to Stocks program. These efforts allowed me to develop professionally and secure internships in both my freshman and current sophomore year, and none of this would be possible without the university's resources. The SEC's commitment to emphasizing the importance of professional development within the College aligns with my passion for maximizing the opportunities provided. This is why I am passionate about contributing to and benefiting from the shared mission of professional growth.",
            "Question 9": "succeeding professionally is something that I am very passionate about, and is something that I will continue to pursue. But this everlasting goal is nothing without the ability to help others and your community. I have had many mentors throughout my life who have taught me so much and shaped me to be the person that I am today. Whether it be a parent who took a chance on me when starting my private soccer skills business, or my boss at my internship this summer who gave me the opportunity and sparked my interest in the business side of engineering. All of these people no matter how large or small the role or gesture was taught me something new. I am forever grateful to have these people in my life and to have them give back to me. So for me being able to give back to my community is very important and is something that I have already begun doing through being a big within my flo and fraternity where I act as a close mentor and friend for my underclassmen. Being able to take this passion a step further in SEC is something that I would love to do. Whether that be through committee involvement or becoming a chair and putting on an event like the career fair. Whatever facet it is, giving back to the university and engineering community is something that I would be very grateful to be able to do.",
            "Question 10": "Growing up I was always around a soccer ball, and during my junior year I had secured a starting spot on the varsity team. Unfortnately, I suffered a series of concussions and disrupted my momentum. Upon returning back from injury, I faced the harsh reality of losing my starting spot due to not being at peak performance that I was at prior. Rather than wondering how this had happened and dwelling on the past , I embraced this setback as an opportunity for growth. I took responsibility for my lack of training, and became committed to regain peak performance. Daily, I invested time outside school, making sacrifices, and adopting a disciplined routine of training and nutrition. This routine demanded focus and dedication, I faced obstacles through missed events and persevered on days when I lacked motivation. However the grit and sacrifice ultimately paid off as I reclaimed my starting spot and captained my team Senior year. This experience taught me dedication and focus, instilling me with a work ethic and determination that I now carry with me. This journey taught me the value of grit and the power of commitment, and continues to drive me within my everyday life."

The reason for this is that only since coming to the College of Engineering here have I been fully aware of what engineers actually do and the different specializations and paths they can take. Before coming to TAMU, I didn't really have a good view of what engineering really was, and if I had gained more knowledge about it during high school, I feel like I would have better prepared myself for the knowledge and routines engineers conduct. That's why I want to help spread knowledge about engineering and its different specializations to incoming students and even high schoolers so that they can make an informed decision about whether they want to pursue engineering and prepare themselves for it.",
            "Question 9": "My long-term professional goals are to be able to manage a company of my own, which would involve employees who, while doing their work and having fun doing so with their fellow coworkers, are allowed to express themselves and their ideas without judgment. The best way I believe I can accomplish this is to find the positive in a situation, even if it seems hopeless, and to allow yourself to get the help of others to reach your goal because, in my opinion, collaboration is the key to success in any project, and no one accomplishes things without the help of their peers. I believe my optimism and receptiveness to others will help the mission of the Student Engineer's Council because, by being optimistic, it increases the likelihood of professional companies wanting to meet us and form a relationship with the council, which strengthens our bond. Another way my passion contributes to the council is that by being receptive to not just fellow council members but also the whole engineering student body, it would allow the council to form more diversified opinions and use those opinions to attract a greater audience through different events. Finally, a way I can contribute to the Student Engineer's Council is that having a positive attitude towards engineering and showing that attitude towards others makes people more interested in the topic and allows us to spread awareness of opportunities in engineering.",
            "Question 10": "In high school, I would work on cars, and one of the main things I was interested in when working on them was soldering wires together. When I first learned what soldering was, I was ecstatic because it was such a convenient way to connect wires together. I decided to take it upon myself to learn how to solder. First, I asked my automotive teacher how to solder, and she did it by soldering in front of me. I observed posture and hand movements, so I decided to imitate him, but when I tried it myself, I messed it up because when I was finished, my wire was too bumpy, and my teacher said I did it wrong. Even though I failed, I knew I couldn't give up, so I kept on practicing over the next few days, and I kept on messing it up. I was about to give up when I went on YouTube and I saw a guy soldering in a different style than my instructor, and I realized that I didn't have to copy the instructor's every move and I could do it my own way. Using my own style, I was able to solder correctly."

I wanted to build a bathroom for students who went to school in my parent\u2019s hometown in Nepal but didn\u2019t have the means to raise money. I went door-to-door, convinced many of my parents\u2019 connections, and marketed my cause. I raised enough money to build a bathroom in a small town school in Nepal. This vigor within me inflated as I watched a thank you video from the school\u2019s children.

Professional advancement stretches much further than this because it is something we will do for our entire careers, and one of the reasons I picked Texas A&M. Drawing on or from professors, advisors, and the countless alumni who helped build Texas A&M and the College of Engineering sets us apart from many other universities nationwide. Learning from their experiences and passing those lessons to the next generation builds strong relationships and helps all of us within the College of Engineering.",

            "Question 10": "I demonstrated a strong commitment to my goal of starting on varsity for football. My commitment to football increased significantly during my junior year because we began to watch game and practice films every morning at six-thirty. I would then go to practice after school, ending around six o\u2019clock, meaning I would spend around eleven to twelve hours a day at school. During the offseason, my position coach would have me lift at six in the morning; then, I would go through the offseason during the period and then come back after school to work out until around five o\u2019clock. This continued the trend of spending around twelve hours at school. Each day, I spent more time in the locker room getting ready for school than in my bathroom at home. This trend continued during my senior year while the rigor of my classwork increased. Instilling this commitment to football allowed me to develop a work ethic and time management skills that will allow me to succeed beyond high school.

I think that joining the SEC and being able to become someone that spreads engineering awareness can both help me be more comfortable with new people and also be the resource to people that may also be struggling socially or just be lacking information in general.",
            "Question 9": "To build upon what I mentioned in the previous question, my goal is to be able to be a part of the external division which seeks to increase engineering awareness through various organized events. I often get nervous when meeting new people, which needless to say makes talking to company recruiters or people in a professional setting an even more nerve wracking experience. In the process of contributing to the engineering events such as E-week and TREC, I am allowed to get better at being a member who actively organizes activities rather than just hesitantly wandering around. I can both lead and help other students and also practice my ability to be confident in leading and interacting. While others that attend the events are gaining more information, I am also being exposed to more ideas and connections that can possibly help me as well. This contributes to the mission of fostering professional advancement since I am both improving myself as an engineering student and assisting other engineering aggies.",
            "Question 10": "Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing basketball a lot during my breaks. I was on my school basketball team for two years in high school. When it came to physical size, most of my teammates and opponents had an advantage over me. Because of that, I wanted to refine my skills more in terms of shooting, passing, etc. For me it wasn't easy to get better. On good days, when I practiced, I felt like I had gotten better significantly. However, as soon as I got into practice games and actual games, my opponents and teammates skills overshadowed mine. This is where a constant cycle of feeling motivated and self-doubt is formed. However, I still loved the game which is why I still practiced. I watched videos of professional players both for the fun and knowledge. My coach was also very supportive when I ask him for tips and guidance. Although I am still not the best even among my friends now, I definitely did improve when I look back on my previous years of basketball."

As a minority student in Engineering I am especially passionate about this and believe it is important to represent other students like myself to allow their voices and opinions to be heard. This will overall improve not only the SEC as an organization but the entire Department of Engineering because everybody has a voice and an opinion.",
            "Question 9": "Helping others is a crucial part of being a good leader. I would not be able to achieve any of my long-term professional goals, including becoming an aerospace engineer for a large company such as NASA and working on large research projects with them, if I did not work to help others. For these reasons, I plan on volunteering with A&M and SHPE events as well as participating in organizations (currently SHPE and hopefully SEC this Spring) so I can build my teamwork and leadership skills that will allow me to accomplish my future goals and become a well-rounded engineer.\nDeveloping my skills will also help me be a better member of the SEC and help further their three pillars through participation and making change within the organization itself or even the Department of Engineering. Since the SEC is a mainly professional organization that helps serve as a bridge between engineering students, other Texas A&M students and the higher-ups of Texas A&M, my passion for helping others and my leadership skills will help the organization continue to be that bridge for everyone at Texas A&M.",
            "Question 10": "Every year for Thanksgiving I bake a pecan pie for my family. However there was one particular year that I forgot to get all of the necessary ingredients and forgot one ingredient crucial for decorating the pie after it was done: powdered sugar. Although it is not necessary to decorate the pie, I made the pie the same exact way every year and I did not want to break the tradition so quickly. The issue was that the recipe I preferred for making whipped cream specifically required powdered sugar and there was no time for my family and I to go back to the store to buy some powdered sugar. I went along with making the pie and once it cooled down and was ready for decorating an idea came to my mind. I googled \"what is powdered sugar made from?\" and it turned out that you could make powdered sugar from grinding down regular granulated sugar and some cornstarch. I did exactly that and was able to finish making the pecan pie like normal. Although I could have given up and left the pecan pie plain, I was determined to make it the way I wanted to for Thanksgiving."

The job market is harsh, and everywhere you look there are people warning not to pursue a career in engineering. Many students feel like they have no future in the field, despite making it this far.\nWhen all you see is red flags and people with experience getting laid off, it\u2019s important that you have some sort of support and guidance. The reason our student body is so scared of getting their food in the door is because they feel like they're on an island. I want to help provide professional development to my peers in a way that makes them feel comfortable with their future in the field.",
            "Question 9": "Throughout high school, I was a member of my engineering club, but it wasn\u2019t until senior year that I really started to get involved as a leader. In just the one year I was a leader, it felt like I was able to make an impact. My main goal was to show the underclassmen that there are exciting careers in engineering and tech. I started to show them different resources and opportunities that they could take advantage of in a way that excited them, whether it was interactive activities or events.\nLast week, I received a message from an underclassman expressing his thanks for my mentorship, as he excitedly shared the news of his acceptance into an engineering program. It felt surreal that my seemingly small efforts in just one year were able to inspire someone to apply and get into an engineering program. That's when I realized that few things make me feel more fulfilled than guiding people through the world of engineering.\nI hope to become a member of the SEC so that I can continue to fulfill this passion and help my peers find success in engineering. During my time in my engineering club, I loved finding different opportunities and sharing them with my peers in an exciting way and I hope to do this in the SEC as well.",
            "Question 10": "In my sophomore year of highschool I took on a job as a waiter to help out my mom expecting it to be easy and straightforward. As a waiter my greatest obstacle, more so than balancing dishes and managing receipts, was overcoming my quietness.\nEach time I seated a table it was hard to get words out, and when I did they would seem forced and unnatural. Eventually my manager told me that I would be shadowing waiters for a week. Naturally, I was embarrassed, but I took it as an opportunity to learn. As I followed around the more experienced waiters I began to pick up on things they did, like picking a conversation that would appeal to the customer. I started to learn how to ask questions and engage the customer in a way that was fluid, casual, and yet still professional. In just a week the job started becoming second nature to me and I started waiting tables by myself. By not becoming discouraged and learning those more experienced than me I was able to transform some of my most glaring weaknesses into my biggest strengths, strengths that have continued to help me to this day."

From day one I was pretending to fix my house with a fake tool set. Then it progressed to building massive Lego sets. And now I am taking engineering courses at the university I always dreamed of attending. With all of that said, I am still not 100% sure of the route that I would like to take for my future. I have narrowed down my choices through research and communication with current engineers, however I think that being a part of the SEC prior to ETAM would heavily assist in my journey to becoming a real engineer. Providing firsthand experience and real time information is something that is priceless to my future as an engineer and to others as well.",
            "Question 9": "One of the hardest things that I have faced while trying to become an engineer is the lack of information about engineering in school. Many people will joke about not knowing what engineers really do, but the truth is that a vast number of people really don't. One of my long-term goals as an engineer is to provide students with the resources to explore engineering at an early age so that they can better understand the purpose of an engineer. If I had understood how many different career paths stemmed from engineering, I would have started looking at what I wanted to do a long before I did. This could be something as simple as informational lectures at schools across the country, or something as big as a class within the school meant to direct students down the path that is best for them. There should be nothing between young students and taking the path that they want to take in life. I believe that educating emerging students about the scale of engineering before reaching college would allow them to choose a major they truly have a passion for, rather than because they don't know what else to do.",
            "Question 10": "Making the TMEA All-State Choir is my largest accomplishment. I have always loved choir, but it wasn't until my sophomore year of Highschool that I seriously committed to it. I started taking voice lessons and made the top choir at my school. The following year I planned to participate in the TMEA process. This consisted of four auditions spanning five months. I worked extremely hard studying all of my music day and night and made it to the last audition. I ultimately fell short at the Area auditions and placed second runner up for the state choir. I knew that I only had one year left to make it, and I was fueled with passion. I started working on the music right when it was released, and after three auditions, I was right back at the Area audition. This time was different as I was completely prepared. I ended up making the TMEA All-State choir and accomplishing my goal. It was at the TMEA convention where I met Thomas Gerber, who conducts two choirs here at TAMU. I am now one of only three freshman Basses in the mixed choir, which is where I plan to stay."

While I finally got one lined up, it was no easy task as many companies rejected my wishes due to my lack of experience. One of my goals as an engineer in the future is to be able to provide future engineers with little to no experience with internships, which allows them to get a head start on their journey into the world of engineering. I want to give back to future engineers who are passionate about getting into the field and wanting to learn. I know that the passion of my future goals towards helping others will contribute to the SEC as I am focused on making not only myself a leader, but those around me leaders as well. The SEC is responsible for being the voice, recognition, and development of all engineers to come to Texas A&M. I want to be able to give passionate engineers the opportunity if they want to put in the work. Through my wishes of wanting to give internships to future engineers to help them gather experience, I give students the proper recognition by acknowledging they are new to the field, allowing their voice to ask questions and gather a better understanding to develop their skills as engineers.

            "Question 10": "In my Junior year, I was introduced to weightlifting. I disliked sports until I discovered weightlifting due to my friends, who took me to the gym for the first time. Even though I could not see any progress initially, I fell in love with the process. I saw others online and knew I had the same potential. Slowly, I built what I considered an impressive physique, which physically showed me what strong commitment can achieve. During my senior year, I suffered an injury in my leg and have been suffering with it ever since. Senior year of high school and my Freshman year of college, I struggled to go to the gym. While I was not as consistent, I still showed up and gave it my all. I was told by friends and even those whom I had never known that I motivated them to go to the gym, which motivated me during my weakest point of not being able to work out or even walk. Now that I am feeling better, I am never taking a day for granted again and will continue to motivate those around me to be the best version of themselves."

Each of the pillars of the SEC Mission Statement offer a comprehensive framework, catering to diverse aspects of being an engineering student as a whole. Some individuals are great at representing the voice of all engineering students, symbolizing a commitment to inclusivity, and addressing all concerns. However, I also think it is important to focus on increasing engineering awareness through programs and events might appeal to those passionate about promoting the field, emphasizing its societal impact and fostering a positive image of engineering. It will show a commitment to providing resources, networking opportunities, and support for individual career development. This is why I think all three pillars are important in their own way and resonate with each of them wholeheartedly.",

Whether through problem-solving initiatives or active participation in outreach programs, I hope to use my technical skills to make a significant difference in communities. This commitment is consistent with the Student Engineers' Council's (SEC) mission of promoting the professional development of engineering students. I intend to work with the SEC on community-oriented projects that demonstrate the practical applications of engineering, thereby contributing to the council's mission of raising awareness about the importance of engineering in broader context.

            "Question 10": "From my most recent experience as a Lab Engineering Co-Op at Trane Technologies I was assigned with a project where I was supposed to come up with a design for the installation of new Heat Exchangers. The heat exchangers would be connected to copper tubing, that would have refrigerant and water lines respectively. Although I have been doing tubing for a while, I have never had the opportunity to deal with tubing in a 3D modeling software. This was the biggest roadblock that was preventing me from completing my designs. Every time I would design a tubing, there would be something that would be missing. Either it would look like a solid cylinder, or it would be missing bend locations and bend radius. In order to overcome this obstacle, I reached out to a senior designer (John) who has specifically been doing tubing for a little over 32 years. After a few meetings with him I was able to get a good grasp of how to do tubing in a 3D modeling software. I believe the first step of reaching out for help was a great decision I took that helped me stay motivated towards the success of my project."

I decided to create the Mentor-Mentee buddy program, a club that would help our high school\u2019s Chinese foreign exchange students transition to America smoother. My friends and I helped teach foreign exchange students English after school multiple times a week. This allowed me to further my goal of learning Chinese while helping others feel more welcomed into our high school.

            "Question 10": "Going into my Senior year, I decided to run a marathon on January 1, 2023. Growing up in a household of runners, I had woken up at six in the morning to cheer my father on during many marathons and aspired to be a finisher like him one day. During this time, I was taking a full schedule of A.P. and Honors classes, which required many hours of studying on a daily basis. Juggling classwork, sports, and marathon training meant that I missed out on parties and events. To properly train, I routinely woke up extra early before school to run, followed by a full day of school and soccer practice in the afternoons. Nevertheless, the sleepy mornings, exhausted nights, and missed parties were all worth it when I had crossed the finish line. The grit and discipline that I learned while marathon training was a lesson that cannot be taught but must be learned. A quote that my dad often refers to that later became my senior quote is \u201cthe time will pass anyway.\u201d This quote explains that while something might be difficult now, all of the hard work in pursuit of a goal will be worth it."

Ethics have always been extremely important to me, so keeping the college of engineering honest and accountable for the students they oversee is very important. Ensuring that everyone has the best experience with engineering is paramount, especially in a college of over 20,000 students. The platform to have an impact when that many people are affected is a huge responsibility for any group of people, and those individuals are obligated by the nature of their position to take it seriously.

            "Question 9": "My long term goal is to be a lawyer, and I would love to help others through that role. For stem majors, this is often IP law. For the present though, that means I just need to focus on school and operate under the assumption of going into the engineering industry. There are a few reasons for this. One is that I want to ensure that I am putting my whole effort into anything I am doing. The more important thought is that I do not want to burn bridges. If my work is low quality and if I were to act as if I do not care about learning or the people around me, I would lose myself. I am passionate that just because someone does engineering during undergrad, they are not pigeon-holed into it as a career. I think that is very important for engineering awareness. Many people think it is constrained and limiting, but engineering opens up so many amazing career opportunities. I think that advocating that idea could help the professional advancement of students so that they can constantly evaluate the path they are following.",

During COVID though, my family got a set of suspension bands. These were so much easier to set up than going to the gym, and had none of the social pressures. I stayed on these for a few months, then when the gym opened back up I started going. It was scary to be going alone. I barely knew which exercises to do for a well balanced workout, and just opted to copy what my brother had done before. Eventually though, through discipline I was able to get over the nerves and found enjoyment in dedicating myself to hard work. For a while this was going well, untiI dislocated my shoulder playing ultimate frisbee. It made me unable to lift for a month. I knew it was important to rest, but after that getting back proved to be difficult psychologically. I didn\u2019t want to go anymore.

My long-term goal, in short, is for humans to become a spacefaring species, and my only professional goal is to contribute as much to this as I can. Now, although this may sound unrelated to the mission of the Student Engineers' Council, I believe this is not so; through providing additional access to aerospace companies specifically, the Student Engineers' Council can further the careers of Aggie aerospace engineers, thus producing some of the most dedicated and driven aerospace engineers in the industry and driving it forward. This holds true outside aerospace, as well; by furthering the careers of Aggie engineers, we can further engineering as a whole, which is inherently based on helping others. I would also add that my short-term professional goal, a successful undergraduate career at A&M, also inherently includes helping others; simply put, Aggies help Aggies. Part of the mission of the Student Engineers' Council (and, really, any student organization here on campus) should be helping others by default, as the collective benefit of individuals deciding to assist one another in achieving a common goal far outweighs any level of personal gain that can result from selfishness.",

Achieving the latter requires essentially becoming one of the twenty-ish best tubists in the state of Texas, and while I was able to achieve this twice, I faced significant roadblocks both times; as with all high school musicians, I had to balance my practice with my schoolwork and other curriculars\u2014especially in my junior and senior years, where I had to balance tuba playing with being a drum major in the marching band. In addition to this, honing my tuba playing required countless hours of what was essentially mind-numbing detail work, which often became frustrating; as we all know, it's much harder to get from a 98% to a 99% than it is to get from a 70% to an 80%. In order to stay focused, I essentially just forced myself to enjoy it; I embraced painful self-improvement and loved working until the work was done, even though it was never really done."

As our hovercraft struggled to navigate the steepest terrain, we hit a huge roadblock. To address this challenge, we diligently videotaped each test, carefully reviewing the images for potential sources of issues. This process allowed us to analyze the performance of the upper aircraft and identify areas for improvement. Another important roadblock was the initial difficulty in getting our altitude aircraft to work properly in different terrains. To overcome this, we followed a systematic experimental approach and thoroughly documented our progress. This dedication allowed us to gather valuable data, make appropriate design changes, and improve the performance of the hovercraft. Remaining focus and dedication was important throughout this endeavor. To keep going, we established clear milestones and maintained open communication within the team. Additionally, we committed to continuous improvement reviews and modifications, which helped us remain focused and committed to successfully achieving our hovercraft design goals."

            "Question 8": "Of the three pillars, I resonate the most with professional advancement, as I seek to climb the ladder of success in the world of industry and bring those around me up it with me. There is much confusion surrounding the professional world, whether it is how to have the \u201cperfect interview,\u201d work best for a promotion, or how to go about networking in the right way. I, of course, am still learning these skills, but I also seek to give others the things I have already learned, so they may prosper and climb high where I fell and learned lessons. In this way, I also know that those above me can give me their advice, fueling my desire to network. In an organization known for its professional prowess, I believe I would not only increase such skills, but learn how to dispense them to others around me.",
            "Question 9": "In the long-term, my goal is to become a high-end machine learning engineer, one who runs his own sophisticated start-up company. Being the owner of such a company brings many benefits, one of those being the ability to voice opinions without fear of significant consequences from a superior. With such a power, I believe that I could make a strong impact as a representative for engineers. As owner, I would be interviewed more, my opinion wouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, and I would have employees I could hear from, especially if my company rose in its size. I could speak on relevant topics such as mental wellness for engineers or sustainable machine learning habits, I would have the monetary funds to donate back to my high school and the A&M College of Engineering, and I would be gifted the ability to build up my own employees for their loyalty. In this way, I believe I could snowball an effect for engineering awareness in those around me and hopefully in the future generations of engineers as well. Ultimately, now knowing the more financial influence I gain results in an even greater ability to voice the problems of my fellow engineers, lights a separate fire in me. I don\u2019t only have to fight for financial security for my future family, technological improvements for society, or the desire to make a name for myself. I now can fight for something perhaps even greater: a way to shift future generations.",
            "Question 10": "The-best-version-of-myself. An ongoing habit, littered with roadblocks, jumbled with contradicting advice, and a storm in itself. I always want to be the best I can be, whether its the gym, school, professional life, diet, or relationships. I\u2019ve been hit with stages of feeling significantly depressed, without guidance, ill from a disease, and just life being chaotic. Surprisingly, I\u2019ve found the answer to be those around you. If they wake up early to workout, you find yourself competing to see who can beat the other to the gym. If they go without pizza and dessert at dinner, well suddenly you are consistent with that habit too. And if you break every now and then, it's incredibly important to forgive yourself and just climb back on the rails and keep working. In little ways, I\u2019ve learned from others how to set my life up for success. I ask my friends to keep me accountable, I write when I feel lost, and I remind myself of long-term goals when I don\u2019t want to wake up in the morning. Sure, I fall, and often too, but the fight also puts a smile on my face, for I wouldn\u2019t want anything without a struggle first."

Because of this belief, the pillar from the SEC Mission Statement that resonates with me the most is fostering the professional advancement of engineering students within the College of Engineering. This above all else must be a priority for the SEC, as a lack of professionalness makes one's achievements null and void to others and works to taint society's view on engineers as a whole. The SEC must always work to preserve the trust afforded to engineers by the world, and this pillar is the perfect means to do so.",
            "Question 9": "In my career as an engineer, I would hope to foster a work environment where all of my colleagues feel heard and appreciated, as I myself would want to be treated. When possible, I would also look to mentor and teach younger engineers in any way possible with the hope of advancing their career and knowledge. Another more specific goal of mine would be to give back to the school of engineering through an alumni program. I think that it would be very rewarding to give back to students in the future, especially sharing the knowledge and pride of being an aggie. With that being said, I believe that all of these goals and aspirations would help the SEC's mission statement have an impact on others not just while I am a student at Texas A&M, but in my career and life as well.",
            "Question 10": "I am a member of the Sigma Chi chapter here at Texas A&M University, and every spring we host our main philanthropy event called Derby Days. To keep it simple, Derby Days is a week-long contest between a bunch of sororities where the goal is to raise the most money for our philanthropy, Huntsman Cancer Insitute. This past spring I was a part of the committee that put on the event, which was a great experience, however, it was definitely stressful organizing and coordinating a weeklong contest. The main issue we faced as a chapter was the quick turnaround in between days, however thanks to great brother involvement and coordination we were able to raise over 50,000 dollars that year for cancer research. With that being said, I think the main motivation for me was the precedent set by our success in previous years, and the expectation to do better."

            "Question 9": "I would say that I have a very strong passion for helping others, which is why I chose to not only be a member of a service organization, but to be a leader in it this year to continue giving back to others while also facilitating professional development for freshmen. I plan on continuing this within whatever company I am a part of as any company that I look for internships, jobs, etc., I also look for what community impact and outreach projects they have and how I could potentially be involved. This to me represents at least the last two pillars of the SEC Mission Statement. SEC strives to increase the awareness of engineering, and I plan on continuing to support events like Kyle Field Day, Run The Ramps, and others that bring awareness to different communities and groups that need support just as any other. The last pillar talks about professional development, and being in a programming service organization I have been able to watch this happen through personal experience with the freshmen that are in my subcommittee. I would love nothing more than to be able to do this through the SEC but in my future career as well. There are only a few years left before I am out in the workforce, so I think that having as much professional development within myself before that time will allow me to be a better leader in industry.",
            "Question 10": "A past experience that comes to mind is when I tore my ACL in high school. Coming from a small town, you play every sport there is and so did all of my friends. The time period from when I tore my ACL to surgery took 5 months because of a long and drawn out process with the insurance. During this time I would just go to school and go home, but all my friends were still practicing and hanging out. I knew that as soon as I had surgery I would do everything in my power to get cleared to play again as fast as possible. I had surgery in December and my rehab progress was going very well. I would eventually get cleared in March to start working out and running again, but no more than 3 days later the nation shut down due to covid. I had no where to go do PT, so I did it all on my own. I would work out for hours everyday of the week trying to make it back to playing condition. It ended up working out in my favor as I would be cleared 6.5 months after surgery."

I want to be involved, and I want to lead with a smile. Being a person that is there to help others no matter what. My vision of helping is aligned with the Student Engineer\u2019s Council\u2019s three goals. For others to truly explain their true feelings. They have to be comfortable with the person they are talking to. Which is why I believe that actively helping others leads to them starting to open and explain their true thoughts. As for increasing engineering awareness, excitement is key to getting more people onboard their majors. When I was in the Boy Scouts of America, several of the scouts that joined my troop, explicitly joined because of my energetic behavior about scouting. This same energetic behavior is what I believe can inspire more people to further explore their engineering major. Fostering professional development in the College of Engineering is something I can achieve by doing the actions that I explained earlier.

When I was a Life Scout my pace slowed down like a slug, it took a renewed sense of discipline in order to overcome these hurdles. This renewed sense of determination was propelled by a sense of giving back to those who have helped me along the way. In fact, it is those feelings that still drive me to do my best every single day, no matter what. The other motivating factor for me was a sense of achieving my dream of being an Eagle Scout.

I think that being able to be good at both of those things is something that I see myself utilizing in my future career. I know that this passion for people would translate very well into SEC because I know how much y'all value outreach. The whole goal of any out reach event is to eventually tell people about engineering, and you need people with experience working and planning social events to help run them. My experience being a social chair in FREE has given me experience in planning and budgeting social events.",
            "Question 10": "Last semester, I decided to pledge for my fraternity. The pledging process was 10 weeks of full-time commitment. It was 5:00 am mornings 3 days a week, and 2:00 am nights 3 days a week. In addition, we had 4 meetings a week and had many painful \"bonding experiences\". In total, it averaged 30 hours a week. When I decided to commit to doing this, I knew it would be very hard, however I also knew that if I committed, I would not quit. I hit many road blocks, physical and mental, however I was able to work though them by reminding myself that I committed, so I would not quit. In the end it was worth all of the hard work that I put in."

            "Question 8": "I believe that fostering the professional advancement of all engineering students resonates the most with me because I would love to learn the process of preparing events such as career fairs and corporate talks. I'm also interested in the financial aspect of the organization, such as budgets and spending. Furthermore, the experience and connections I would gain by being a part of the team and meeting all kinds of engineers would be invaluable..",
            "Question 9": "I hope to further develop my social and leadership skills, which would be helpful in my professional career as an engineer since communicating effectively with clients and co-workers is vital in any kind of engineering industry. With the skills I gain through this esteemed organization, I wish to further the interests of all Aggie engineers by preparing events that would allow them to connect with the professional world and gain essential skills in engineering industries.",
            "Question 10": "Currently, I'm focusing the majority of my free time on learning new programming languages to make projects because I realized that to be a desirable engineer in the CS industry, I need to dedicate more time on developing my coding skills. For the past 3 semesters, I was not able to make any outstanding achievements outside of the classroom because I was disillusioned by the steep learning curve and believed that I did not have enough time to invest in those extracurricular activities. However, after going to this semester's career fair, I was awakened to the fact that I can't keep avoiding my tasks if I wish to be successful. I don't think it is too late now to try to join organizations and practice my coding skills. Even if this semester doesn't go as I hope, I will have to keep on pushing through."
